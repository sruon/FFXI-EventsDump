## String References

- **7905**: You see a message engraved on the stone:
- **7906**: These marshlands belong to a savage race of beastmen called the Quadav. Many have ventured in these lands seeking fame and fortune, but were never seen again.
- **7907**: But I have vowed to make a complete map of Vana'diel--the guilt I would feel for leaving these marshlands blank far outweighed the danger of entering them.
- **7908**: During my survey, I made the mistake of building a fire and was promptly captured by the Quadav. In their village, I was dumbstruck to see that their buildings were made of wrought metal!
- **7909**: As much as we use the Tarutaru magic of fire to light our smoking-pipes, the Quadav--a barbarous tribe by any account--had secretly harnessed much of Bastok's metalworking technology.
- **7910**: When I told them of my quest, they were most eager to help, releasing me and even going so far as to give me a guided tour of their home! --Gwynham Ironheart, 763 Crystal Era.
