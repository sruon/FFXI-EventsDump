## String References

- **7922**: <Sniff>... Baladanzo...please come back... Don't leave me...<sniff>...alone...
- **7923**: Oh, hello there, [mister/lady]. Tell me, have you been to Mhaura? The port town that lies southeast of here?
- **7924**: I heard once that it was the most quiet, peaceful place in the whole wide world.
- **7925**: My dear friend Baladanzo and I thought we would go there, and leave behind this terrible, terrible place. But the road was sealed with a mountain of rubble!
- **7926**: The ground rumbled...rocks started to fall. I thought we would be crushed, and ran away as fast as I could. But Baladanzo...<sniff>...he wouldn't come with me.
- **7927**: "I hear voices, lad! Voices on the other side of this wall! I'm a-gonna dig on through and take you to Mhaura like I promised, just you wait!" he said.
- **7928**: The ground...<sniff>...it wouldn't stop shaking. I was so scared...that's why I ran back here. But Baladanzo...he wouldn't look back. He just started tossing aside rocks and shouting, bellowing...<sniff>...like a madman...
- **7929**: Please, [mister/lady]... You must check on Baladanzo for me. He was my only friend back in Windurst. Without him, I just...<sniff>...
- **7935**: Poor Baladanzo... He used to be such a...<sniff>...gentle soul...
- **7936**: Still, it's touching somehow... He's trying to bring a mountain down...for me... I don't suppose it will help, but I heard that those rotting bog bodies have the ability to cut through solid stone...
- **7946**: ...I see. Baladanzo was a steady hand in my life for so long, but perhaps it is time I learned to take care of myself. Yes. I will be as strong as he once was...
