## String References

- **7847**: Why, that's odd. Wherever-wever did it disappear to...?
- **7848**: Why, hullo there. You have the look of a bravey-wave soul just itching to venture outside of this encampmentaru. How about lending me a helping hand?
- **7849**: You're familiar with the Cardians, are you not? Those cutesy-wutesy little fellers patrolling the area.
- **7850**: They're more than just decoration, you know. Why, they serve a valuable role in protecting us from the ghastly crittarus roaming about this canyon!
- **7851**: With the fiends growing ever-wever fiercer, we simply can't have enough of them. Unfortunately, I seem to have exhaustarued my supply of the starfruits essential for their construction.
- **7852**: Plentifully they once grew within the walls of Windurst, but alas! Now, all that remains of our supply is stored at the encampmentaru northwest of here.
- **7853**: Our quartermastaru Kopuro-Popuro oversees the supply chest there. He is a bit, shall we say, eccentric? But he will certainly provide you with what we need.
- **7875**: Oh, thank you ever-wever so much! This is all I need to constructaru a new batch of Cardians that will strike fear in the hearts of fiends far and wide!
- **7876**: Here's a small token-woken of my appreciation. Take it and use it well!
- **7877**: What's that? He's still rambling-wambling on about his beloved "Boxuxu"?
- **7878**: <Sigh>... You'll have to forgive the poor dear. I'm afraid his mind hasn't been the same since he lost his one and only to the monstarus that razed the Federation.
- **7879**: Quite a shame, really... There was a time when he was an accomplished creataru of Cardians himself.
- **7880**: As you see, these times have taken-waken a toll on us all. It may not help, but I will have a talk with him when I see him nextaru. Thanks for sharing-waring your concern!
- **7881**: I cannot restaru until we have a Cardian army mighty enough to fend off the Abyssean hordes...
- **8022**: <Player>! I have wonderful news! Thanks in no small part to your assistance, we now have a Cardian stationed at each and every one of our outpostarus!
- **8023**: I also have some less-than-wonderful news...
- **8024**: It would seem that, er, not all the Cardians are behaving according to prescribed speci-wecifications.
- **8025**: Could I trouble you to investigate and reportaru back on any Cardians whose behavior seems...amiss?
- **8026**: There are five of them in all. If you've any experience with them, a quick chat with each should be enough to isolate any potential problems.
- **8027**: And one more thing...I would suggest staying in the canyon until the job is completaru.
- **8028**: If you absolutely must go elsewhere, you'll want to start your investigation over upon your return. Their condition is known to fluctuate-wuctuate most rapidly, you see.
- **8029**: Good to see you back, <Player>! Well? Were you able to find out anything?
- **8030**: Which Cardians were out of whack? [Six of Diamonds./Five of Diamonds./Four of Diamonds./Three of Diamonds./Two of Diamonds./Sorry, let me start over.../That's all of them./I'll get back to you on that...]
- **8031**: Let me see here. You say that you observed a defectaru in...
- **8032**: [Six of Diamonds/Five of Diamonds/Four of Diamonds/Three of Diamonds/Two of Diamonds]...
- **8033**: Truly? All were functioning properly-woperly, you say?
- **8034**: Are you sure, now?
- **8035**: Are you sure? [I'm sure./Let's try that again...]
- **8036**: Wonderful! I'll pass along your findings to our maintenance team immediately!
- **8037**: The Cardians serve us well, but with the strain of this harsh environment, their condition is known to degenerataru rapidly. If it wouldn't be too much of a burden, please lend us your powers of observation from time to time.
- **8038**: Wonderful! I'll pass along your findings to our maintenance team immed-- Hm? What's this? An emergency dispatchy-watch?
- **8040**: Yikes! What a catastrophe! I must send out a repair team at once!
- **8041**: ...Yes, yes... Oh? Is that so? But [he/she] said... Hmm, that's curious.
- **8042**: Are you certain that [Six of Diamonds/Five of Diamonds/Four of Diamonds/Three of Diamonds/Two of Diamonds] at [the eastern ward guardpostaru/the western ward guardpostaru/the westaru camp/the central-wentral camp/the northern-worthern camp] was acting strangely? Our contact on site assures me that he's in tip-top shape, and indeed just helped to fend off an onslaught of fiends.
- **8043**: Well, better safe than sorry-worry, I suppose... I'll have a thorough checkup performed, just in case.
- **8044**: I've afraid I have my hands full dealing with our rogue Cardian. Come back when things have settled-wettled down a bit, will you?
- **8049**: Ah, <Player>. Could I trouble-wouble you to check on our Cardians again?
- **8050**: Need an explanation? [Good to go!/Just to be safe...]
