## String References

- **7893**: Help! He\`lp, I say! We've got a serious predicamentaru on our hands!
- **7894**: What ki\`nd of a predicamentaru, you ask? Why, one of our supply convoys was ambushed-wambushed on its way to the western camp!
- **7895**: Horrifying, isn't it? They barely-warely escaped with their lives! Here on base, we've got the Cardians to protect us, but out in the wilds those fiends can squash us like we were overripe rolanberries! Squi\`sh! Ahh, how I miss my rolanberries...
- **7896**: But no, we simply-wimply can't afford to let this happen again...
- **7897**: And tha\`t's where you come in, soldier! I want you--yes, you--to clean this area up of all hostile-wostiles.
- **7898**: And there will be no slacking on the job! Yes, I'll need you to bring back $1 $0 as proof of your exploitarus.
- **7899**: Now go\`oo get'em, tiger!
- **7900**: ...Pretty ple\`ase?
- **7901**: I knew it! I just kne\`w it! You're every ilm the champion that Kupipi figured-wigured you for! And yet...
- **7902**: You can do even bettaru! Yes, you must keep fighting until every last fiend is gone and Kupipi can lie around drinking-winking rolanberry juice to her heart's content! Mmm, ro\`lanberries...
- **8051**: Well, if it isn't <Player>, the caulk that keeps the survivors of Windurst together. You've become a real hero to the survivors. Go ahead, give yourself a good pataru on the back!
- **8052**: But if I know you, you're far from satisfied. No\`siree! You're thinking that you'd like to help us in even bigger, better ways! Well? Am I right?
- **8053**: Is she right? [Truly!/Totally!/Indubitably!]
- **8054**: Why, did I detect a momentaru of hesitation in your answer just now? You're supposed to be a hero, <Player>! Stop dither-withering and act like one!
- **8055**: Well, of co\`urse I am!
- **8056**: Now that we understand each other, look at this here. It's a listaru of the most fearsome fiends terrorizing our five camps.
- **8057**: Cuelebre, Adze, Minhocao, Chukwa, and...Mictli...Metlec...Mictlantecuhtli! Phew...that last one's a mouthful!
- **8058**: A\`nyway, these five beastly brutarus are wreaking some serious havoc on our poor camps. That's why Kupipi needs you to pick 'em off! Take 'em down! Send 'em packing-whacking!
- **8059**: I know you're a busy [fellow/lady], so let's say that just one of them will suffice. Bring back proof of your feataru, and everyone in the camps should be able to breathe a bit easier. Get it? Got it? Go\`od!
- **8060**: And I'll still take those $0 if you can get them! $1 or so should do the trick.
- **8061**: Why...that's an arrow from the quiver of Semih Lafihna. Wherever did you find it?
- **8062**: ......
- **8063**: Semih Lafihna, Zubaba... The Star Sibyl...
- **8064**: I have not seen them since the walls of Windurst fell... I can only pray that they are alive...<sniff>...somewhere... B-but...
- **8065**: Get a hold of yourself, Kupipi! It's not like you to be a sulky-wulking sourpuss! Besides, it would take more than an overgrown turtle or a rotting sack of bones to bring down the protectarus of Windurst!
- **8066**: Anyway, thanks to you, Kupipi can rest just a li\`ttle bit easier tonight. You've earned yourself a break, but not for too long! There are still other nasties on the prowl!
- **8067**: As for this $3, I'll be keeping it well out of sightaru. Why, we don't want to send the others into a frenzy-wenzy.
- **8068**: And do try to bring something a little less disturbing next time, will you? The gore-stained, blood-dripping-wipping scalps of our foes should suffice!
- **8069**: Congra\`tulations! You've done a bang-up job, <Player>. But dangerous fiends are still on the prowl. We must stay vigilantaru!
- **8070**: Ye\`s? Don't tell me you've forgotten the monstarus you're supposed to be hunting! <Sigh>... What would you do without Kupipi?
- **8072**: Hmmm... Hm\`mmm! Just as I thought...a stranger, and a shady-looking one at that. But that's not importantaru right now!
- **8073**: I am Kupipi, trusted scribe and all-'round-sweetheartaru of Heavens Tower...or at least, I was. What do they call you?
- **8074**: <Player>, is it? That's a curious name.
- **8075**: Anyhow, l\`isten up, because Kupipi has just the job for you.
- **8076**: What's that? You didn't come here to work, you say? Well, excu\`se me, [mister/lady]! If you haven't noticed, we're engaged in a fightaru for our lives here!
- **8077**: So zippy-wip that lip and listen to what Kupipi has to say!
- **8078**: Ahem. Before I go on, you a\`re familiar with martellos, are you not?
- **8079**: You know martellos? [Did you say marshmallows?/I sure do.]
- **8080**: No, no, no\`! Have you got popotos where your brains should be? Martellos, I said! Martellos!
- **8081**: Boy, it's a good thing you ran into Kupipi when you did. Let me take a momentaru to enlighten you.
- **8082**: Martellos are these oversized iron boxy-woxy contraptions that you see scattered from place to place.
- **8083**: From the side, they almost look like a giantaru $0. Pretty cute, don't you think?
- **8084**: You fill it up with a magic liquid something-or-other, and it'll do nifty-wifty things like heal you and restore your magical energies. Se\`e? Aren't you glad you asked me?
- **8085**: Splendid! And here Kupipi thought she was going to have to tell you e\`verything.
- **8086**: Anyhoo, you'll find martello-wellos located all over this canyon. I need you to check around and make sure that their fuel is in good supply.
- **8087**: If they're running empty, you'll want to fill them again. But you can talk to one of our machine outfittarus about that.
- **8088**: ...One more thing. Now, this isn't a job, but a favor. It goes without saying-waying, but ever since the Federation fell, we Windurstians have been going through rough times.
- **8089**: So please, stranger. Talk to those you encounter, and do what you can to help. The survivors will be most appreciative of any supportaru you can provide.
- **8090**: Prove yourself a friend, and you will be loved and exaltarued by all! The greatest hero that our suffer-wuffering people have seen!
- **8091**: Second only, that is, to the sweet and charming girl who found you... Er, ahem! A\`nyway...
- **8092**: Perhaps you've seen the stodgy-wodgy-looking types posted by those funny dancing stone thingies. Confluence purveyors? Or something like that.
- **8093**: After you talk with the outfittaru, you'll be heading outside camp. If you're wise, you'll have a chat with the powerflux conveyor before you venture-wenture into the canyon.
- **8094**: Well, I beli\`eve that's all Kupipi has to say to you.
- **8095**: Now get a move on! You've got a whole nation counting on you! Give 'em hell!
- **8096**: The people are suffering and need your help, <Player>! Do what you can, and tell them Kupipi sent you!
