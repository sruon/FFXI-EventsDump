## String References

- **7802**: These martellos are defensive fortifications developed by the resistance to aid in our battle against the fell hordes. Enchanted structures, they may be employed to restore your health and magic, cure ailments, and generally restore you to fighting trim.
- **7803**: I have been entrusted with the supervision and maintenance of these martellos...but this is none of your concern.
- **7805**: Need something? [Assist with replenishment./Assist with upgrades./Martellos? Come again?/Nothing in particular.]
- **7806**: Splendid! Your aid is a great boon to the resistance effort. To replenish a martello, you'll need to insert one of these $5 into the structure.
- **7807**: Be forewarned: you will be unable to carry these and $5 at the same time.
- **7808**: Take along the $3? [Yes./No.]
- **7809**: We would be particularly indebted to you for efficient replenishment of martellos in remote locations. Best of luck in your efforts!
- **7810**: Why, is that not $6 already in your posssesion? You need only insert that into a martello to initiate replenishment.
- **7811**: I see that you currently possess $6. Do you wish to abandon your upgrading efforts and participate in replenishment instead?
- **7813**: Your support is most heartening in these dark times. Upgrading a martello will require you to attach a device known as $6.
- **7814**: Mind you, the device is rather unwieldy. You will not be able to carry it and $6 at the same time.
- **7816**: Hm? Is that not $6 you hold in your hand? You need only find the martello you wish to upgrade, and attach it.
- **7817**: Is that $6 I see? Do you wish to curtail your replenishment activities and assist with upgrading instead?
- **7818**: Welcome back, friend! Allow me to take that $3 off your hands. How did you fare in your efforts?
- **7819**: I see, I see... Martello #0$1, you say? It sounds as if the operation was [a modest success./a reasonable success./a rousing success!/an unqualified success!]
- **7820**: The resistance greatly values your contributions. Take this as a small token of our appreciation, and do not hesitate to return the next time you are willing to lend your support.
- **7821**: I've been working with these here martellos since I was knee-high. Ask away, and my knowledge is yours.
- **7822**: Ask something? [So, what's a martello?/Martello replenishment./Martello upgrades./Cautionary notes./Not now.]
- **7823**: The device we know as the martello was first developed by military engineers many years past, during an age of great war. Martellos serve to keep combatants fighting fit, healing their wounds and restoring their mental energies.
- **7824**: You will observe that martellos have been constructed in numerous locales, so as to provide strategically located safe havens for harried resistance fighters. No doubt you will find yourself making use of them as well.
- **7825**: In the bowels of each martello is contained a tank designed to hold martello fuel.
- **7826**: This $3 is the lifeblood of the martello, and the source of its curative powers. Depleted stores will render the device little more than an oversized parchmentweight.
- **7827**: That being the case, we're in continual need of volunteers willing to take on the vital task of replenishing these martellos.
- **7828**: I have been charged with overseeing a supply of martello fuel. Should you be willing to take part in a replenishment run, you need only say the word. Needless to say, you will not go unrewarded for your efforts.
- **7829**: Feast your eyes on this $3. She's a beauty, isn't she? Installing one of these into a martello will increase its fuel capacity.
- **7830**: An upgraded martello will be able to sustain its energy stores for a longer time between replenishment operations. Needless to say, this is a blessing and a half to those on the battlefield.
- **7831**: Unfortunately, the installation procedure is quite complex. As such, we can only entrust it to experienced hands.
- **7832**: 5 are quite large and unwieldy. Even the burliest among us would be unable to carry one and $6 at the same time.
- **7833**: Furthermore, these materials are quite unstable, and will rapidly corrode and be rendered useless if brought outside our immediate environs.
- **7834**: 'Course, not that anyone could manage to travel that far, what with these fearsome landslides...
- **7835**: Warning: Changing areas, logging out, or becoming disconnected will cause all data pertinent to this quest to be reset.
- **7837**: The resistance is currently suffering a materials shortage. Those wishing to participating in replenishment and upgrading operations should return at a later time.
