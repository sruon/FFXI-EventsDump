## String References

- **8104**: I remember like it was yesterday-ay-ay. I was in my lab, where a particularly accommodating adventurer had come to me with a lovely bout of the plague. That's when I heard a rumbling-tumbling crash and a hideous scream-eam-eam...
- **8105**: The next thing I knew, there were hideous creatures bearing-wearing down on us from all directions. The War Warlocks, the Patriarch Protectors, the Sibyl Guards and the Mithran Mercenaries...Tarutaru, Mithra, and Cardian alike foughtaru bravely, but the enemy came in oodles and scoodles...
- **8106**: It soon became clear that the fight was hopeless, and we were ordered to take sheltaru in Heavens Tower. Oh, it was a terrible-werrible scene! The Star Sibyl in tears, declaring our beloved Windurst lost as she summoned what remained of her strength to incant the teleportation spell that would lead her people to safety...
- **8107**: ...But it failed, I'm afraid. The teleportation itself was a success-ess-ess, but we were sent scattered helter-skelter to all manner of bleak and hostile destinations.
- **8108**: Those of us in this camp are just a handful of survivors who were fortunataru enough to end up together-wether.
- **8109**: But I don't remember seeing you back in the tower. Wherever-wever did you come from?
