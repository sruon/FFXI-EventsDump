- **13703**: Now all we do is waitaru, and... ...Darn it all!
- **13704**: Urk... Every time they see me they try to bite my nose off like it's a little-wittle sausage!
- **13705**: You see, that's why I've got this mask... Ah! Here we go.
- **13706**: While Vana'dielians have long since mastarued the art of taming the chocobo, a few of us have been working on domesticating some more...exotic beasts.
- **13707**: We think we've finally stumbled upon something, but we're loath to release it upon the populace without taking it for a <ahem> test drive. And that's where adventurers come in!
- **13708**: We figure that if chocobos can run fast, then how about some muscular raptors? We've been toiling day and night, but it's hard to get them to obey anyone other than their handler-wandler.
- **13709**: And this cute little thing here is no differentaru!
- **13710**: That's where you come in--we want her to get used to being around people of all sorts.
- **13711**: So I propose a little deal--if you take her around Batallia Downs, then I'll give you this whistle as a little presentaru.
- **13712**: That's as good a deal as any, I'll say!
- **13713**: What say you?
- **13714**: Ride the raptor? [Sure! This sounds fun!/Maybe later.]
- **13715**: Aw, shucks. I'll be here should you change your mind-wind.
- **13716**: Wheeeeee! Finally, someone says yes!
- **13717**: Okay, you put your hands here... And your feet here...
- **13718**: Picture perfectaru!
- **13719**: Awww, run into a little bit of trouble?
- **13720**: That's okay--why don't you try again?
- **13722**: Now be a doll, would you, and open-wopen up your map of Batallia Downs?
- **13723**: Okay. See these eightaru spots I've marked? They're locations within the downs that I need you to visit. There's a few hollows there, you see...
- **13724**: ...and in those hollows I've left some of our erstwhile companions' favorite treats for you to give to her. If you'll forgive the saying--you'll have her eating out of your hands.
- **13725**: But eight spots is a trifle much, hmm? So let's cut it down-wown to five. That should be enough to make her cuddle up to you like a puppy.
- **13726**: And when you're done with that, I need you to go over here.
- **13727**: My good friend Syrillia will be waiting for you to return that raptor-waptor.
- **13728**: [Like I just said,/You may recall that] sometimes our friend here can be...less than cooperative.
- **13729**: She can get tired--or is it better to say sick of it?--and slow down, and may even shake-wake you off her back.
- **13730**: But she's a sucker for encouragementaru, so if that happens, just /cheer her up.
- **13731**: Another thing: she'll go bolting off home if you dismount, so if that happens just amble-wamble your way back here.
- **13732**: Have a safe trip!
- **13733**: Do you need another explanation of what it is I wantaru you to do?
- **13734**: Do you require an explanation? [Nope. I've got it./If you don't mind.]
- **13735**: Look who made it back--and no worse for the wear.
- **13736**: A deal's a deal!
- **13737**: With this $3, you should be able to call your raptor to your side anywhere out in the field.
- **13738**: Don't give me that dirty look--this one is a bit more docile than the one I had you take around Batallia Downs.
- **13739**: To ride a mount, just select "Mount" from the "Abilities" submenu.
- **13740**: Your $3 is a bit special, because it can produce all manner of lovely sounds.
- **13741**: If you come across $1 in your travels, would you mind showing it to me? I can register it in your $3.
- **13742**: And if you stumble-wumble upon an item known as an "astral notebook," then I can register that, too.
- **13743**: $1 and items beginning with a "t" can be used to obtain new mounts by trading them to %.
- **13744**: Feel free to do so right away.
- **13745**: Note that $1 will not be consumed in the process.
- **13746**: Ah, and while I have you here, the raptor-waptor you took out before could always use more training.
- **13747**: I don't think I could provide you with any more rewards, so it's really up to you. But it would really be quite the boon for me.
- **13748**: Hello, hello!
- **13749**: Help train the raptor? [Let's do this./Can I have an explanation?/Maybe later.]
- **13750**: A wonderful choice indeed! Let's get you all gussied up and ready to go.
- **13751**: Then let me remind-wind you. First, show me your map of Batallia Downs.
- **13752**: Awww... Well, hopefully you'll stop by again.
- **13753**: If you bring me a special item known as an "astral notebook," then I should be able to register it in your $3.
- **13845**: Ah, how lovely! Let me register your $0 in your $3.
- **13846**: Amazing-wazing! That's $0!
- **13847**: Wait...I remember reading-weading about the legendary noble chocobos in a treatise by the esteemed Markovich. "Legendary Chocobos of Our Time," I believe that title was.
- **13848**: Chocobos with such cherry-colored coatarus are of royal lineage and are only born during very specific times of the year.
- **13849**: You must be very special-wecial indeed to have procured such a wonderful companion. I hope you enjoy them!
- **13850**: Oh, what I wouldn't give to ride one!
- **13851**: At the very least, please let me pet them!
- **13852**: Either way, let me register your $3.
- **13853**: With this, you should now be able to mount [a chocobo/a raptor/a tiger/a crab/a red crab/a bomb/a sheep/a morbol/a crawler/Fenrir/a beetle/a moogle/a magic pot/a tulfaire/a warmachine/a xzomit/a hippogryph/a spectral chair/a spheroid/Omega/a coeurl/a goobbue/a raaz/Levitus/an adamantoise/a dhalmel/a doll/a golden bomb/a buffalo/a wivre/a red raptor/an iron giant/Byakko/a noble chocobo/an ixion/a phuabo/a craklaw/an alicorn/a bubble crab].
- **13854**: Ahh, welcome. Did you happen-wappen to bring an astral notebook with you?
- **13855**: It appears not. Although, I see you have something else you wish for me to take a looksie-wooksie at.
- **13856**: Now then, let me see what you've got there...
- **13857**: <Player> showed the $3.
- **13858**: Hmm... Yes, I see... Oh no!
- **13859**: It seems-weems that I've done it again...
- **13860**: Anyways, this appears to be rather old music. Indeed, it has piqued my interestaru.
- **13861**: Of course, I'm no archaeologistaru or anything. Please tell me if you learn anything new.
- **13862**: Hey! That's the $3! Allow me to register-wegister it in the $3.
- **13863**: Hmm... It's not working for some reason. Please give me a momentaru to check it out.
- **13864**: What is going on here? Oh no, not again!
- **13865**: It seems I was careless-wareless.
- **13866**: Huh? The music-wusic from before was decoded and registered!?
- **13867**: I see... People from the pastaru must've performed the same research I did...
- **13868**: Just thinking about it fills me with a sense-wense of romanticism.
- **13869**: Okay! I've got to give it my very best effortaru!
