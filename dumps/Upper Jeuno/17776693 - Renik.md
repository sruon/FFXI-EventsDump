## String References

- **7634**: It's not easy to see the archduke. But people who have say he's different. Like he's got this...aura...
- **7635**: I wish I could see him. That way, I could find out if it's true!
- **11120**: <Player>'s badge flashes brightly.
- **11128**: Rumors of the archduke's approval of the mercenary recruiters have increased people's trust. Perhaps that's why there are so many applications for the Salaheem's Sentinels--despite its location far across the Gugru Blue.
- **11129**: Maybe if I become famous there as a Jeunoan, the archduke would invite me to meet him and honor me as the pride of his people!
