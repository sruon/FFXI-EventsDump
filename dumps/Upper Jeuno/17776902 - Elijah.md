## String References

- **13880**: Let us hope that those at Salahaam's Sentinels keep up their end of the bargain...
- **13881**: Ah. And you must be...
- **13882**: <Player>. Of course. Your reputation precedes you.
- **13883**: I am well aware of the deeds you have performed for me via your connections in Salaheem's Sentinels.
- **13884**: But where are my manners? I have yet to introduce myself.
- **13885**: I am Elijah, but a humble member of the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network (A.M.A.N.).
- **13886**: I have acquired some information about threats that need to be vanquished as part of your excellent work in the Records of Eminence initiative.
- **13887**: I am loath to admit that these foes may be beneath your station, but I would ask you to remove them nonetheless.
- **13888**: Accept the request? [Of course./No thanks.]
- **13889**: You have my gratitude. Allow me to provide you with the relevant intel.
- **13890**: Unfortunate, but not altogether unexpected.
- **13891**: Your quarry resides on the continent of Aradjiah.
- **13892**: Though I would ordinarily rely on local mercenaries for the task, this requires a more...delicate touch.
- **13893**: I promise that the reward will be worthwhile. Double so if you bring proof of the kill.
- **13894**: Should you be able to do so, that is...
- **13895**: While I appreciate your efforts, I am only able to provide you with rewards once per month (Earth time).
- **13896**: I am positive that we will be able to uncover more threats in the upcoming months.
- **13897**: Of course, I will provide you with more information as circumstances warrant.
- **13898**: Once again, your assistance is most appreciated.
- **13899**: Thank you for setting the appropriate objective.
- **13900**: May you strike true.
- **13901**: Elijah smirks at you.
- **13902**: Well, well, if it isn't my favorite intrepid adventurer, <Player>.
- **13903**: You seem to have been quite busy of late, what with all the fiend slaying and equipment collecting going on.
- **13904**: And in between all your marauding, you still found time to deal with Falak. Heroism truly is your most impressive attribute.
- **13905**: You've really helped me to regain my faith in humanity.
- **13906**: And given your track record and breadth of talents, I would ask another favor of you.
- **13907**: And just as before, this will be handled via Records of Eminence. Have to make sure all the Is are dotted and the Ts crossed, as you know.
- **13908**: For you see, the fiends I hunt are not just limited to Aradjiah.
- **13909**: Although it does seem they aimed to break a particular seal...
- **13910**: ...this time they aim to lay claim to the World Eater Egg. No, this simply will not do.
- **13911**: This goes directly against the will of my master, and I shall suffer none to cross him.
- **13912**: I trust you will vanquish this threat with all due haste.
- **13913**: We're counting on you, hero.
- **13914**: Pleasure as always, <Player>.
- **13915**: Your fervor in vanquishing those which threaten us all has not gone unappreciated.
- **13916**: Although perhaps you were only assisting me for baubles and glory rather than righteousness and justice, I must thank you all the same.
- **13917**: So without further ado, permit me to introduce you to your next targets.
- **13918**: You are to make for Aydeewa and Arrapago.
- **13919**: It appears that the dead have redoubled their efforts to usher in the egg's hatching, and it has already been brought to the reef.
- **13920**: And if we can hinder their efforts...well, suffice it to say that my lord will be quite pleased indeed.
- **13921**: Though I would normally be content to leave the dead well alone, I fear that his will is indeed absolute in this matter.
- **13922**: Of course, I need not tell you that for every one you strike down two more will doubtless take its place. I can think of no task more Sisyphean.
- **13923**: Were it up to me, I would see the entire place set ablaze.
- **13924**: I must admit that my mental health has taken a turn for the better knowing I can count on you to handle this issue.
- **13925**: I must remain resolute, for it will not be much longer before my plans come to full fruition.
- **13926**: But I am vexed that my comrades--my lord's right-hand troops--have been lax in their reporting of late.
- **13927**: Doubtless they have their hands full. May the will of my lord be done.
- **13928**: Goddesspeed, hero.
- **13929**: Why won't the dead just stay dead? This goes against all our calculations.
- **13930**: Perhaps they fear my lord's wrath and deemed their chances best on this side of the veil.
- **13931**: Ah, my erstwhile friend! You couldn't have arrived at a more fortuitous time.
- **13932**: At risk of sounding like a broken orchestrion, I confess that I require your assistance once more.
- **13933**: I had been under the impression that the dead were set on returning here, to the world of the living--but it appears I was mistaken.
- **13934**: What their true aim is remains yet a mystery, but one thing is certain--their leader possesses an immense power that defies expectations. Their plans must not be allowed to succeed.
- **13935**: I say this not to diminish the vast capabilities of my master, but to demonstrate to you the commitment of my colleagues and I to ensuring that their machinations bear no fruit.
- **13936**: Yet as the field of battle expands, our forces find themselves stretched increasingly thin. Even my master is vexed at where best to concentrate our efforts.
- **13937**: And so my master created--employed--new soldiers to aid in the efforts. Prompt though their reports were, I found the content thereof to be impudent at best.
- **13938**: "Stop yapping and clean up the stragglers. Those are your orders, and you'd best follow them."
- **13939**: The audacity! Whether they are right or not is immaterial--their tone is completely unaccpetable.
- **13940**: Ugh. To think they get to me so easily...
- **13941**: The will of my master is paramount. If we are to clean up the "stragglers," then so be it.
- **13942**: I will fill my charge without fail.
- **13943**: I have taken the liberty of preparing a list of your next targets.
- **13944**: Though information on previous marks was collected by my underlings, this time I have taken it upon myself to collate the necessary materials.
- **13945**: Fear not. It is as accurate as the previous entries. I take my job quite seriously.
- **13946**: It remains to be seen why our foes are mustering their forces here in Vana'diel.
- **13947**: Ah, but you fancy yourself a defender of Vana'diel, do you not? How quaint.
- **13948**: I wish you the best of luck.
- **13949**: What is this? You wish to know if I'm familiar with a black-clad Goblin?
- **13950**: Yes, I have had the displeasure. A more uncouth specimen I have never come across.
- **13951**: But if you're going to wallow in the mud like a pig, then it was only appropriate that I gave them an appropriate porcine companion...so I introduced them to Shami.
- **13952**: Pleasure to see you, <Player>. How are those two pig-headed buffoons doing?
- **13953**: "What buffoons?" Why, Shami and Shemo, of course.
- **13954**: I sent them that accursed Goblin and their accompanying retinue. Filth loves its own kind.
- **13955**: Hahaha... Tell me how that turned out?
- **13956**: Wh-what? Not only were the Goblin team not there, but then Duke Alloces...?
- **13957**: But if the gate is closed, then it stands to reason that Duke Alloces shouldn't even be here!
- **13958**: Ugh. This is why you can never trust anything to a low-level demon.
- **13959**: But setting that small matter aside... You are after more information on the World Eater Egg, are you not?
- **13960**: You must wonder what this means for the baneful dead.
- **13961**: Worry not. I have prepared a list of more targets for you.
- **13962**: Haha... Surely each one you banish brings a little bit more peace back to Vana'diel.
- **13963**: Perhaps you have already surmised my true identity, but it is too late for you to turn back now.
- **13964**: After all, the proverbial contract has already been signed.
- **13965**: Hoho...a deal with the devil is not so easily overturned...at least not without paying the ultimate price.
- **13966**: And with what you now know about some of the world's ugly truths, well...
- **13967**: And that lovely retinue who depends on you oh-so-much will surely come through for you in the end.
- **13968**: And of course, my lord Odin is depending on you as well.
- **13969**: And I'm sure none of us want these targets to be in cahoots with Garazu-Horeizu, correct?
- **13970**: Betrayal will be deemed a failure to fulfill the obligations of your contract. Surely I need not say more.
- **13971**: So keep doing what you do best, and there will be no problems.
- **13972**: Ah, and one last thing. If you try to flee, or tell anyone who we really are, it will not end well for you.
- **13973**: This, too, would be an egregious violation of the terms of our little "agreement."
- **13974**: You see, <Player>, we have eyes and ears in every corner of Vana'diel.
- **13975**: And we are always watching...listening...
- **13976**: Ah, <Player>. Somehow, I knew you would come.
- **13977**: The sealing of the gate has been quite the catalyst. Wouldn't you agree?
- **13978**: My understanding is that you are working together with Skokkr to reforge the Prime Weapons, are you not?
- **13979**: My understanding is that you have worked together with Skokkr and succeeded in reforging a Prime Weapon, have you not?
- **13980**: I wish you all the best in your journey to vanquish Chaos. After all, the Prime Weapons are the keys.
- **13981**: Your Prime Weapon holds the key to besting Chaos, as you doubtless already know.
- **13982**: But I would advise you one thing: the Prime Weapons belong to my master, and my master alone.
- **13983**: And when they return to him, I have no doubt that they will make their way into my hands...as my just reward for all I have accomplished.
- **13984**: Oh, yes. The time for me to wield the Prime Weapons is close at hand.
- **13985**: In fact, this puts me in the mood for a rousing tale. A secondhand tale, so I leave the analysis of its veracity to you.
- **13986**: 5000 years ago, the Prime Weapons were made manifest after an eternity of trial and error.
- **13987**: Those in charge searched endlessly for a way to figure out how to stop Chaos from devouring the astral plane.
- **13988**: Of course, that was eons ago, so the exact time frame isn't clear, but I am led to believe that over one hundred years of effort were poured into this endeavor.
- **13989**: It started with research into souls that hungered for more. A contract between them was established.
- **13990**: But those initial results were...disappointing. More pure souls were required.
- **13991**: I need not spell out for you what that implied.
- **13992**: Many souls were snuffed out on the altar of progress, irrevocably removed from the cycle of life and death.
- **13993**: And that is how those involved eventually arrived at the idea of imbuing souls into implements of power.
- **13994**: If those souls are angered or cry out for vengeance, well...I'm sure that manifests itself in the potency of the armament.
- **13995**: Perhaps that is why the Prime Weapons gleam with that beautiful obsidian light.
- **13996**: Why, it is positively inspiring! Surely you wish to brandish them in battle even more than before.
- **13997**: Ah, but we have time for one more tale. You know of the relic weapons, correct?
- **13998**: My master conceived them during Ragnarok, and they contain the souls of the enlightened races.
- **13999**: My master chose only the strongest from among those who proffered themselves up in his service.
- **14000**: They cried out for succor. Who were we to deny them?
- **14001**: Why, we were even able to help them defend their kingdoms, although perhaps in a different way than they had envisioned.
- **14002**: Not that those nations exist anymore, mind you.
- **14003**: That is enough stories for one day.
- **14004**: I trust you found it a pleasant enough diversion, but now I bid you return to the task at hand.
- **14005**: My success is linked to your success, after all. And I have new targets for you to hunt.
- **14006**: Yes...I can feel it. The Prime Weapons will soon be mine to wield...
- **14007**: Elijah smiles at you.
- **14008**: Elijah begins laughing boisterously!
- **14009**: <Player>. I must confess, I thought you had forgotten about me.
- **14010**: We are at our watershed moment. I promise to be brief.
- **14011**: As you are eminently aware, Garazu-Horeizu is on the move.
- **14012**: Of course, we have no choice but to answer in kind.
- **14013**: Yet moving too hastily has caused the downfall of many, so I would ask for your aid once more.
- **14014**: The first issue is dealing with the defectors amongst the beastmen who have joined forces with Chaos.
- **14015**: Unfortunately, their contingent is present not only in the Middle Lands, but Aht Urhgan and the Far East as well.
- **14016**: With the enemy spread out across the world, I have had to dispatch some of my most loyal retainers to the far reaches of the globe.
- **14017**: While they are dealing with the threat above, you will deal with Garazu-Horeizu at the gate between this world and the next.
- **14018**: Of course, this will allow the gate to be opened.
- **14019**: I will take up the rear guard, so you have not to fear.
- **14020**: Ah, but perhaps you are concerned that my protection alone may prove insufficient.
- **14021**: Are you concerned? [Of course!/Of course not!]
- **14022**: Then we shall continue along the same path we have traveled to date.
- **14023**: Oho. I may not have a Prime Weapon, but I promise that my skills are more than sufficient.
- **14024**: Then we have our tasks. Let us see them through.
- **14025**: This is our watershed moment. We must defeat Garazu-Horeizu and his minions.
- **14026**: Best of luck to us all.
- **14027**: <Player>. It has been a spell, hasn't it?
- **14028**: You did well in ridding us of Garazu-Horeizu and Chaos.
- **14029**: I would venture to say that your performance exceeded my wildest expectations.
- **14030**: So much so, in fact, that I find myself at a bit of a loss.
- **14031**: The original plan involved my master having a bit more of a...pivotal role in the aftermath, so to speak.
- **14032**: But you kept all the best parts for yourself.
- **14033**: Still, he was quite pleased with how you presented yourself during the entire ordeal.
- **14034**: And my efforts were rewarded in turn, as I have been permitted to remain in this world for a spell.
- **14035**: A curse in disguise, if you will, for I had hoped to return to his side.
- **14036**: Yet you deserve to know a little bit more...perhaps my true name. Consider it a gift.
- **14037**: I am Markgraf Eligos, and I serve as one of Odin's elite.
- **14038**: May our relationship remain as fruitful going forward as it has been to date.
- **14039**: Yes, "going forward," as I still have the usual tasks for you to fulfill.
- **14040**: Though Garazu-Horeizu no longer poses a threat, his hypnosis magic has still not completely dissipated from the land.
- **14041**: And given the details of our pact, that means you still have your end to hold up.
- **14042**: The pact cannot be broken, but rest assured that you will continue to be rewarded.
- **14043**: The terms should be familiar to you by now. Continue to serve.
- **14044**: And just to reiterate--there is no way to escape your obligation.
- **14045**: I wish you the best of luck...
- **14046**: ...and trust you will continue to meet the terms of our deal.
- **14047**: Keep at it.
- **14048**: Good day, <Player>.
- **14049**: It seems you have been quite busy cleaning up the riff-raff.
- **14050**: The A.M.A.N. has reported to me that your data has come in quite handy--and that you have filled all the tasks I have required of you.
- **14051**: What's this? You wish to discuss it further?
- **14052**: Ah, you wish to receive additional rewards for vanquishing what threats remain. I see, I see.
- **14053**: And you have been unsuccessful in your efforts to procure such rewards, no?
- **14054**: For when you defeat them, they keep coming back?
- **14055**: Forgive me for laughing, but you are aware that you are asking for rewards for killing that which is already dead.
- **14056**: They are of a different world than ours, after all, and trapping them in this one is a fool's errand.
- **14057**: But I do admire your gumption.
- **14058**: I am not an unreasonable man. If you are able to best them again if and when they should appear in our plane, then who am I to deny you an extra prize?
- **14059**: Then I shall prepare some more objectives for you to sink your teeth into. That strikes me as fair, wouldn't you agree?
- **14060**: Let us set the rate: one additional reward for every three objectives completed.
- **14061**: After all, what adventurer does not love rewards, hmm? Just don't get yourself offed in the process.
- **14062**: Oh, yes, and be aware that the additional reward can only be earned monthly (Earth time).
- **14063**: Just keep doing what you're doing.
- **14064**: Good day, <Player>.
- **14065**: Oh, worry not. Your achievements have not gone without notice.
- **14066**: Here are your additional rewards.
- **14067**: May our paths cross again soon.
- **14068**: Good day, <Player>.
- **14069**: "Additional rewards?" Surely you do not think you have earned any.
- **14070**: Remember that your contract with me must be carried out in full.
- **14071**: Good day, <Player>.
- **14072**: You may consider your monthly duties filled. As always, your support is greatly appreciated.
- **14073**: Hopefully our paths will cross again next month.
