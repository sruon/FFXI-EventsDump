 6753: All moogles like taking care of plants, kupo!

 6755: This Mog House is your very own room, kupo! But it's still a little bare, kupo...
 6756: It needs some furniture and maybe some paintings to make it more cozy, kupo!
 6757: If you find any during your travels, I'll help you lay them out, kupo! I can't wait, kupo!
 6758: Storage space becomes available when you place furniture in your Mog House using the "Layout" command, kupo!

 6764: And finally, a little bit of advice!
 6765: If you ever run into any problems, just ask your fellow adventurers for help!
 6766: If you type "/ae Hello!", then your message will be heard by many people.
 6767: If you type "/ae" followed by your issue or question, other adventurers will help you!
 6768: Remember that you can only do this while in town, kupo!
 6769: Okay, kupo! Good luck on your adventuring, kupo!
 6770: Do you want me to teach you about your Mog House again, kupo?
 6771: Ask about your Mog House again? [Don't ask./Ask.]
 6772: Over the mountains and the rolling hills, I'll go wherever my master wills.t
 6773: Master! I traveled all the way here at your bidding, kupo! Even a Rent-a-Room needs a moogle, kupo!
 6774: But there are a few things you can't do in a Rent-a-Room, kupo. Select "Mog House" from the main menu and check, kupo!
 6775: When you go back home, talk to the guard in front of the residential area to call me back to the Mog House, kupo!
 6776: Master! I have something to tell you, kupo!
 6777: I found this precious item under the $3 pillow, kupo!
 6778: It's all yours, kupo!
 6779: I used the $3 to write a song for you, kupo!
 6780: Here, kupo! Please think of the lonely moogle waiting for you back home when you hear this song, kupo!
 6781: I found this item in the back of one of the $3's drawers, kupo!
 6782: It's all yours, kupo!
 6783: I found this in the back of the $3, kupo!
 6784: It must be a gift from the heavens, kupo! Here, take it, kupo!
 6785: I found this item inside the $3, kupo!
 6786: Luck is on your side, kupo! Take it, kupo!
 6787: I fished this item out of the $3, kupo!
 6788: It was very hard work, kupo... I'm very tired, kupo...
 6789: I found this behind the $3 painting, kupo!
 6790: This must be what they mean when they say, there are many mysteries behind works of art, kupo! It's all yours, kupo!
 6791: Something clattered inside the $3 when I shook it! Look what fell out when I turned it upside down, kupo!
 6792: It's all yours, kupo!
 6793: I felt there was something strange about the $3, and when I looked into it, I found this, kupo!
 6794: We moogles have very good intuition, kupo! It's all yours, kupo!
 6795: Oh, Master! You won't believe what I found out on the doorstep this morning, kupo!
 6796: At once so glorious and so ghastly, and just for you! Think of it as a holiday gift from a humble moogle to his favorite (and only) master, kupo!
 6797: For your own safety, it is recommended you set the Mog House exit as your home point after changing jobs.
 6798: Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with [overwhelming/powerful/faint] [fire/ice/wind/earth/lightning/water/light/dark] energy, kupo!
 6799: Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with [the overwhelming/the powerful/the faint] energy of many different elements, kupo!
 6800: Each item of furniture you place using the "Layout" command corresponds to a different element, kupo! The type of energy that envelops your Mog House changes depending on those elements, kupo!
 6801: When that energy changes, my powers change as well, kupo! Master, you should try placing all sorts of furniture in your Mog House, kupo!
 6802: 
 6803: mes7
 6804: mes8
 6805: mes9
 6806: TEST-No.$1
 6807: I found $6 inside the $3, kupo!
 6808: Kupo...? I sense that this $3 is very, very special! You should go to the store where you bought it and ask about it, kupo!
 6809: Master! Master! Look what I found underneath the $3 this morning, kupo!
 6810: It has been wrapped and everything! I wonder who it could be from, kupo!
 6811: Look what I found in your $3!
 6812: You seem quite dehydrated lately, so maybe you should have it. I'll try putting some more grapes in the barrel and see if I can make any more, kupo!
 6813: Your Mog Locker lease is valid until // ::, kupo.
 6814: The lease on your Mog Locker has expired, kupo. Please trade $0 to me or to Fubruhn in Aht Urhgan Whitegate.
 6815: Your Mog Locker lease has been extended until // ::, kupo!
 6816: Master, Master! I found this in the $3, kupo!
 6817: It must be a present from the smilebringers. Here, you should have it, kupo!
 6818: If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a woman named Alaune. She's at the Westgate in Southern San d'Oria, kupo.
 6819: If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a man named Gulldago. He's at the West Gate in Bastok Markets, kupo.
 6820: If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a woman named Selele. She's at Leviathan's Gate in Windurst Woods, kupo.
 6821: Master! What [an egg-ceptional specimen/egg-ceptional specimens] you have there! Now, if you'll just let me have a look-see, kupo...
 6822: We egg-tach this thingamajig to that thingamabob, just like so, kupo...
 6823: Now for the coup d'egg-grace...!
 6824: Voila! Isn't she a beauty, kupo? Utterly egg-squisite workmanship, I do degg-clare!
 6825: We egg-stract this doodad from that doohickey, just like so, kupo...
 6826: Voila! Your original egg-redients, entirely egg-tact, kupo! If you change your mind, just trade them back to me or one of my moogle egg-sociates!
 6827: Oh, Master, look at this! I was poking around in the drawers of your $3, when this $4 just popped out! I guess you never know what you're going to find until you look for it, kupo!
 6828: Isn't the aroma positively scrumptious? It's all yours, kupo! Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!
 6829: Here, I want you to have it. In fact, I insist, kupo! Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!
 6830: Look at what I found while cleaning out the $3: $4!
 6831: Here, I want you to have it. In fact, I insist, kupo! Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!
 6832: $3{$3^$3$97F$31V$P10i]\7
 6833: It all began with a raindrop, or so the legend says...
 6834: Master! Oh, master, look! We've sprung a leak, kupo! Just look at it drip, drip, dripping away!
 6835: What a terribly troubling turn of events, kupo! But have no fear! Sit tight and you'll see why I'm the most renowned handymoogle in the three nations!
 6836: Goddess have mercy on my moogle soul. Look at this mess! Rotting roof boards! Rusted nails, kupo!
 6837: Why, it's a miracle this tottering, tumble-down shanty--I mean, this beautiful abode of yours--is still standing, master!
 6838: Anyhow, this simply won't do, kupo. We must make repairs before we have water up to my little wings!
 6839: I figure all I'll need is a good $0, $1, and $2 to have this fixed up good as new, kupo!
 6840: Could I trouble you to track them down? While you're out, I'll patch up the other problem spots.
 6841: And do hurry, Master! Lest you return to find your poor moogle friend lying prostrate in a pernicious puddle of rainwater, kupo...
 6842: Thank you, Master, but our leak is in another Mog House! Bring this to me when we're back home in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst], won't you, kupo?
 6843: You've found them, kupo! I knew I could count on you. That's what I tell all my moogle buddies. "Why, my master is the boldest, brightest, bestest master of them all!" Now we just take these, and...
 6844: Kupoooooo`there you have it! Better than new! Why, a bevy of wild buffalo could barge in here this second and it wouldn't budge an ilm, I say!
 6845: Which reminds me, I went ahead and relayed the requisite reports to my manager at the MHMU.
 6846: But wouldn't you know it, kupo? It seems there's been a trifling bit of trouble at one of our Rent-a-Rooms in Jeuno as well!
 6847: You know the one, right across from Durable Shields. Whatever could have gone wrong, kupo?
 6848: Well, there's nothing to be learned lollygagging around here. Come, Master, we're off to Jeuno!
 6849: Little did anyone suspect that this would prove to be only the beginning of a harrowing nightmare unheard of in the annals of mooglekind...
 6850: Do something? [Read instructions./Change parameters./Teleport to key locations./Warp to home point./Receive items./Obtain 100,000,000 gil./Do nothing.]
 6851: Hail, adventurer! I am the most mighty of moogles, my miraculous magicks able to alter all manner of arcane attributes!
 6852: But be forewarned, kupo! Once modified by moogle magick, your parameters cannot be restored to their prior state!
 6853: Furthermore, you may trade a moogle storage slip to me to wipe it clean, or mystically entrust its entire contents to me. Quite convenient, wouldn't you say?
 6854: Adjust parameters? [Edit main job level./Reset ability recast timer./Obtain merit points./Receive all spells/rolls/attachments./Unlock all jobs and support jobs./Cancel.]

 6893: Hang on! I have an amazing announcement!
 6894: The hallowed halls of your house are even more exciting! Why? Because now there's a second floor, kupo!
 6895: But before you bash your way in, I've got a trifling task for you to tackle.
 6896: Capricious Mithra cubs have cajoled critical information out of the M.H.M.U., and I want you to wrest it from them!
 6897: Visit the three nations and question them, kupo!
 6898: Now you know the nitty-gritty, so enjoy your new floor, kupo!
 6899: Kupopo? You mean you already know?
 6900: Magnificent and marvelous! Then proceed without delay!
 6901: Enjoy extra space to store your sundries!
 6902: Remodel your room to fit your finicky tastes!
 6903: Incorporate ostentatious overseas objects! All this and more!
 6904: But only on the second floor, kupo. I like the first floor as it is.
 6905: And as for your potted plants--they only persevere on the ground, kupo.
 6906: And moghancement effects only activate for furnishings fitted to the first floor.
 6907: Wish we could help more, but we spend enormous amounts of energy on one floor already!
 6908: Go forth and frolic in your new abode, kupo!
 6909: You can access the antechambers from the front door. Enjoy!
 6910: $3 might bring a certain je ne sais quoi to your Mog House, kupo!
 6911: Your fate rides on the changing winds of Vana'diel. I can give you insight on the local weather.
 6912: What area's weather do you wish to know? [Nowhere./Ronfaure./La Theine Plateau./Valkurm Dunes./Jugner Forest./Batallia Downs./Gustaberg./Konschtat Highlands./Pashhow Marshlands./Rolanberry Fields./Beaucedine Glacier./Xarcabard./Cape Teriggan./Altepa Desert./Sarutabaruta./Tahrongi Canyon./Buburimu Peninsula./Meriphataud Mountains./Sauromugue Champaign./The Sanctuary of Zi'Tah./Yuhtunga & Yhoator Jungles./Qufim Island./Tu'Lia./Ferry./Airship./Jeuno./Uleguerand Range./Tavnazian Archipelago./Riverne - Sites #A01 & #B01.]
 6913: That area's forecast for today is for $0 with occasional $1. There is also a slight chance of $2, so caution is advised.
 6914: The forecast for tomorrow is for $0 with occasional $1. There is also a slight chance of $2, so caution is advised.
 6915: And, the forecast for the day after tomorrow is for $0 with occasional $1. There is also a slight chance of $2, so caution is advised.
 6916: Today, that area's weather will be $0 with a chance of $1.
 6917: Tomorrow, the weather will be $0 with a chance of $1.
 6918: And, the day after tomorrow, the weather will be $0 with a chance of $1.
 6919: Today, the weather in that area will be $0. There is also the possibility of $2, so caution is advised.
 6920: Tomorrow, the weather will be $0. There is also the possibility of $2, so caution is advised.
 6921: And, the day after tomorrow, the weather will be $0. There is also the possibility of $2, so caution is advised.
 6922: The weather in that area today will be $0.
 6923: The weather tomorrow will be $0.
 6924: The weather the day after tomorrow will be $0.
 6925: And that's the report, straight from Vana'diel's official weather linkshell.
 6926: What area's weather do you wish to know? [Nowhere./Wajaom Woodlands./Bhaflau Thickets./Mount Zhayolm./Caedarva Mire.]
 6927: What area's weather do you wish to know? [Nowhere./Ceizak Battlegrounds./Yahse Hunting Grounds./Foret de Hennetiel./Morimar Basalt Fields./Yorcia Weald./Marjami Ravine./Kamihr Drifts.]
 6928: (...Yeah, that's what I said!)
 6929: (But you know what? Oh, wait. Hold on...)
 6930: I'm sorry, can I help you?
 6931: <Player> points to the item in %'s hand.
 6932: Oh, this? It's a magical shell called $1.
 6933: You want to know about $1? Let me tell you all about them!
 6934: What do you want to ask? [What's $1?/What types of $1 are there?/How do you use them?/Never mind.]
 6935: These magic shells are full of mysteries...
 6936: You can get beautiful pearls from them. Some say these are some new form of shall shells, but...
 6937: Even if you take out a pearl, they make more and more of them. Strange, isn't it?
 6938: What's more strange is that pearls taken from the same shell actually transmit sound, no matter how far apart they are!
 6939: So, if you speak into one of the pearls, people who hold other pearls or the shell they were made from can hear you!
 6940: It's as if they were linked by an invisible thread... Huh. I guess that's why they have "link" in their names.
 6941: So anyway, the shells are called $1, and the pearls $2.
 6942: There are also different types of $1.
 6943: Is there anything else you want to know?
 6944: What do you want to ask about? [%./$1./$2./$3./Back.]
 6945: % are $1 when you first buy them at the store.
 6946: Once opened, they start making $2 and become the communications tool everyone's using.
 6947: You can set the color and name of your $1 when you open it. Make sure to set the ones you like because you can't change them afterwards!
 6948: $1 are $0 that have been opened and function as a communications tool.
 6949: You can make $2 and $3 from those shells. They're like the party leader of an adventuring party.
 6950: All items created by your $1 retain the $1's color and name.
 6951: Make the name something unique so that it's easy to remember.
 6952: $2 are pearls that $1 make.
 6953: If you equip one, you can communicate with people who have the same $2 and the $1 they were made from.
 6954: They're like the party members in an adventuring party.
 6955: $3 is a bag full of $2. You can make one by metamorphosing a $2 for that purpose.
 6956: It won't have all the features of $1, but you can take out an endless amount of $2 like $1.
 6957: You have to use $1 to make $3. The same goes if you want to turn it back into $2.
 6958: They're like the party leaders of an alliance of adventuring parties...
 6959: You want to know how to use them? Where should I start?
 6960: What do you want to know about? [Where to get one./Assigning a color and name./Making $2./Equipping them./Speaking into them./Metamorphosing $2./Throwing them away./Back.]
 6961: You can buy $1 in shops. They're a little pricey, though.
 6962: It might be best if you ask friends who want pearls to chip in.
 6963: A freshly bought $0 has neither a color nor a name.
 6964: $1 becomes usable only after you've chosen its color and given it a name. Then you can use it to make $2.
 6965: You can combine different amounts of blue, red, and green to make your shell's color. You can only use alphabet letters for the name, but you can use capital and lowercase letters anywhere you want.
 6966: $2 are made from $1.
 6967: Making them is easy. Just equip your $1, then go to "Linkshell" in the menu and select "Create Pearl"!
 6968: All $2 made this way retain the $1's color and name, so it's easy to tell who can hear you!
 6969: You can make as many $2 as you want, whenever you want, so don't worry about making too many of them!
 6970: You can also make $2 with $3 the same way.
 6971: Oh, and...you use your $1 to make $3, too, but it's a little complicated so I'll tell you later.
 6972: You have to equip $1 for it to have any effect.
 6973: Go to "Linkshell" from the menu, choose the $1 you want to equip, and you're all ready to go.
 6974: It's a little different from equipping weapons and armor.
 6975: After you've done this, an icon that represents what you've equipped will appear beside your name. This is where the color you chose becomes visible.
 6976: If someone "checks" you in this state, they will be able to see the name of the $1 you have on.
 6977: Follow the same steps to equip $2 and $3.
 6978: To speak into $1, change your chat mode to "linkshell," and whatever you say will be heard by everyone who has the same "link."
 6979: You can also type "/linkshell" and type your message. The shorter version is "/l" (lowercase "L" for "linkshell").
 6980: Ah, but of course, you have to have $1, $2, or $3 equipped first.
 6981: Whatever you say will only be heard by people who have the $1, $2, or $3 with the same link.
 6982: So if you want to stop listening to your link, all you have to do is unequip your $1, $2, or $3.
 6983: $1 can metamorphose other people's $2 and $3. Of course, it can only affect those that were made from the same $1.
 6984: There are two types of metamorphoses, which are: 1: Make into sack / Make into pearl 2: Kick.
 6985: Both need the target $2 or $3 to be equipped at the time.
 6986: "Make into sack / Make into pearl" makes the target $2 into $3 and vice-versa.
 6987: It's useful if you want someone else to take care of handing out $2 in your place.
 6988: "Kick" actually breaks the link with the target $2 or $3 and turns it into junk.
 6989: Once kicked, the $2 will become broken and unusable... Only use this in extreme cases!
 6990: $3 can also be used to "kick" but they can only affect $2.
 6991: $1, $2, and $3 are normal items, so they can be thrown away easily.
 6992: But as normal items, you'll lose them permanently if you throw them away.
 6993: It won't really matter if it's $2, but throwing away $1 is not a good idea!
 6994: Oh, are you sure? Well, if you ever have any questions about $1 you know where to find me!
 6995: (So anyway, as I was saying...)
 6996: Can I help you?
 6997: Welcome to the Chocobo Shop.
 6998: Welcome to Viette's Finest Weapons.
 6999: Welcome to Durable Shields.
 7000: Welcome to M & P's Market.
 7001: Up: Ru'Lude Gardens Down: Lower Jeuno ( [facing Bastok)]
 7002: $0
 7003: It reads, "Staff Only."
 7004: It's locked.
 7005: The petition is complete!
 7006: You have $0 more [signature/signatures] to go.
 7007: Good luck with the petition, young one!
 7008: I hope you get enough signatures.
 7009: Best of luck with the petition.
 7010: Hey, how's the petition goin'?
 7011: Good luck with those signatures!
 7012: Your current HP: $0.
 7013: Hello. This must be your first visit.
 7014: I am Monberaux, chief physician here at Monberaux Infirmary. My services are available for any affliction.
 7015: I can give advice for general matters as well.
 7016: So feel free to stop by for a quick chat. I'm always in.
 7017: Why, hello there. Are you feeling all right? You seem well enough to me.
 7018: Remember to stop by if you're not feeling well.
 7019: Sorry for all the commotion at the embassy. Let me apologize. Wolfgang and I are old friends, and both of us are quite stubborn, I'm afraid. I hope you'll forgive me.
 7020: The ambassador has returned? I shall stop by for a check up later.
 7021: The ambassador comes by often. It must be stressful knowing that international relations hinge upon your performance.
 7022: Take care of yourself, all right? You're always welcome as a friend, but I don't like seeing you as a patient.
 7023: The clock tower? Of course I object! Every time its bells ring, the town feels so alive. I shall sign the petition, too.
 7024: Galmut used to come all the time. He'd limp in here after each fight so I could tend to his wounds. He was quite a little crybaby, too!
 7025: Good luck with the petition.
 7026: Hello. Are you feeling all right?
 7027: (Dr. Monberaux is a fine doctor and I really respect him, but he tries to care for people, beastmen, animals, and even machines.)
 7028: (I think that's noble and all, but it's so hard being a nurse here. I wish I got paid. The doctor often doesn't charge for his services, you see...)
 7029: Oh, and please don't mention that to anyone, all right?
 7030: Monberaux and Wolfgang have known each other since they were lads. Indeed, they were like brothers, watching the airships come and go.
 7031: And now one's a doctor and the other the captain of the guard. I'm so proud of both of them!
 7032: But you know, I hardly see them together anymore. I'm sure they're both very busy.
 7033: What, no more clock tower? No! The pride of Jeuno, she saw us through the war! What about Galmut? Good heavens, where do I sign!?
 7034: Galmut used to be a regular hooligan, but once he became the clockmaster, he turned over a new leaf and began doing repairs for us, too.
 7035: Monberaux's a fine lad. Aye, I wish every doctor was more like him. Why, today I'm fit as a fiddle, but I stopped by all the same.
 7036: That doctor, bless his heart, always greets us with a smile. The ladies like him so much, they've put a fan club together.
 7037: Come to think of it, Narihira doesn't stop by anymore. I suppose he's been feeling better ever since Galmut took over as clockmaster.
 7038: It would be tough at his age. But not a day goes by without hearing its glorious ring now that Galmut is on the job.
 7039: What!? They're going to tear it down? Well, of all the hare-brained ideas... I'll sign yer petition. You betcha!
 7040: Back when Galmut first started, you couldn't get Narihira to stop talking about him. That old gearhead looked mighty happy to find a youth who would follow in his footsteps.
 7041: Well, I guess those two mules had enough in common to get along. Now, run back out there and get some more signatures!
 7042: So the clock tower's safe? Well, bless my buttons! I bet Narihira's happy as a goat!
 7043: Hello again. I have a special patient right now. But there's nothing I can do for, er, it... Please, would you mind helping me?
 7044: The patient is in this room.
 7045: Nobody is in the room.
 7046: This way, please.
 7047: I...$26I...
 7048: Why don't you fight, you disgusting defect! Your brave brothers are putting their lives on the line fighting for our country!
 7049: WhY...$26WhY must$26fIghT? NOt WiSh$26hArM aNyoNe.
 7050: That's really-willy ridiculous! Cardians are built to fight!
 7051: You're worthless! Go anywhere you want, but don't ever show your failure of a face around here. You're bad for morale!
 7052: Nobody needs a spic-n-spineless defect like you.
 7053: I$26cOwArd? NoBoDy neeD$26me? I... I...
 7054: I$26uNwaNteD.
 7055: A Goblin brought him. They say that Cardians come to a stop once their magic runs out, but it looks like this one shut himself down.
 7056: I heard that the Manustery in Windurst can bring back Cardians that have come to a stop.
 7057: Take the Cardian to the Manustery? [Of course./No, I cannot.]
 7058: Quite noble of you. I wish you luck.
 7059: Well, if it's beyond even your ability, I wonder what we should do...
 7060: Hello! Is Two in here? I heard he's here!
 7061: There you are...
 7062: Well, say something! Give me another lecture!
 7063: What's the matty-matter with Two? Can't you do anything?
 7064: Well, we can take him to Windurst and replenish his supply of magic.
 7065: And, that will make him bettaru, right?
 7066: Yes, he will start moving again. However...
 7067: However?
 7068: I believe he will lose his memory.
 7069: What? Wait, that means...
 7070: That's right. He won't remember you when he awakens. He'll live, but as a completely different Cardian.
 7071: No way!
 7072: But I'm for it. I don't care if Two forgets about me!
 7073: I see...
 7074: I just don't want to lose you, Two. I have to tell him I'm sorry.
 7075: Well, let's leave the rest up to [her/him]. You just pray for them. That's all you can do right now.
 7076: O-okay.
 7077: We'll see each other again, okay? You promise me, Two.
 7078: All you need to do is take the Cardian to the Manustery in Windurst. I wish you luck, friend.
 7079: Oh, so you made it to the Manustery with that Cardian. You have my thanks. The rest depends on him, I suppose.
 7080: I hope he does not forget all the happy times he spent with that kind Tarutaru family.
 7081: Oh, so he got back home safe. He is yet another victim of the tragedy of war. But...now, now...he should be fine... Just fine.
 7082: In this temple we pray to Altana. You should pray for forgiveness, too.
 7083: Oh, Father...
 7084: I've seen no signs of recovery. What should I do?
 7085: Albrecht, my child... Surely your prayers will be answered.
 7086: Pray, and all will be forgiven.
 7087: Y-yes, Father.
 7088: Goddess of the Dawn! Please help me! All I can do now is pray.
 7089: You, too, should pray as that faithful one does.
 7090: Only then will you receive her blessing.
 7091: Albrecht...
 7092: The Temple of the Goddess welcomes you. If you seek guidance, join us in prayer. Her divine wisdom will light the path.
 7093: Oh, all you want is a candle? Very well. Fetch me $7, and a candle will be yours.
 7094: Excellent. As promised, I bestow upon you this holy candle. May its light guide you along the path of righteousness!
 7095: Kweh!
 7096: Kweeeeh...
 7097: Kweh!!!
 7098: Looks like it's not hungry. Perhaps it will eat later.
 7099: Looks like it's full. Perhaps it will eat later.
 7100: I guess it ain't hungry. Try feeding it later.
 7101: Give us a break! What do we gotta do to get you to eat? I'm all out of ideas.
 7102: How am I supposed to work with you standin' there, huh? Scoot! You ain't got what it takes to handle chocobos.
 7103: How am I supposed to work with you standin' there, huh? Scoot! Or do you want to go chocobo ridin'?
 7104: You wanna ride a chocobo? [I sure do!/Not now.]
 7105: No offense, but would you mind not hangin' around here? I'm busy! I've got a flock to watch!
 7106: Not again... I see this a lot these days. Look, there's more than meets the eye when it comes to chocobos!
 7107: But a lot of folks abandon them nowadays. That's why there's so many wild chocobos now. It's all their fault. But you've never abandoned a chocobo, right?
 7108: Have you ever abandoned a chocobo? [Yes, I have./Nope, never.]
 7109: I knew it! You'll never ride a chocobo, ever! Step down, if you know what's good for you.
 7110: Yeah? Well, talk is cheap, buckaroo.
 7111: All right, then... See that chocobo? If it takes to you, I'll let you ride.
 7112: Now's your chance to show me what you're made of, buster!
 7113: Eh? So you wanna ride a chocobo, do ya? Ha! You don't look strong enough to even stay in the saddle!
 7114: What's your problem? You wanna ride a chocobo?
 7115: 'Zat so? I guess it wouldn't hurt to give it a try, now would it?
 7116: Of course ya do! Nowadays everyone wants to ride a chocobo! Why, this is a golden opportunity for you to step into the wide, wonderful world of avian delight...
 7117: Then again, you young people have a tendency to throw creatures away without a moment's thought. That's why there're more chocobos living out in the wild now than I ever dreamed of as a kid. You wouldn't dream of commiting such a terrifyin' act though, would ya?
 7118: You can't fool me. I know a good kid when I see one. The eyes give it away.
 7119: Of course you wouldn't!
 7120: Still, I can't grant you permission to ride so easily. The Vana'diel Chocobo Society'd never allow it.
 7121: I've got it... See that fine creature over yonder? If she takes to you, I'll let you ride her. Good luck, kid.
 7122: The master found this chocobo collapsed out on Rolanberry Fields. I bet it ran away from its last owner.
 7123: It seems it was whipped and worked to exhaustion. It's so scared of people, it cowers from everybody.
 7124: Those savages! That's no way to treat a chocobo... I try my best for him, but he won't eat a thing.
 7125: But I wonder... It just might eat $7. You know, the stuff that heals chocobo wounds.
 7126: Chocobos like to be fed by hand. See? Like this.
 7127: They learn your scent after you feed them by hand each and every day for a really long time.
 7128: Little by little, you gain their trust. And you pick up what kind of personality your chocobo has.
 7129: Well, bust my buttons! You still here? You ain't got what it takes, punk. Hit the road!
 7130: If that chocobo takes to you, I'll let you ride.
 7131: They don't eat nothin' until they start to recognize you. Just keep at it, bucko.
 7132: He's afraid of you. They're like that with people they don't know.
 7133: Kweh... (He still looks terrified of you.)
 7134: They won't eat a thing until they're comfortable with you. Just keep at it, okay?
 7135: Kweh... (He still looks a little wary of you.)
 7136: Nope, still no go. A friendly chocobo would be eating already, but this one's different.
 7137: Kweh! (He still looks slightly uncomfortable with you.)
 7138: Wow, I thought it would take longer. I think we've almost won him over!
 7139: Well, look what we have here! He's already munchin' away. Looks like he's almost ready.
 7140: Right when I thought I'd lost you, I find your sorry face here.
 7141: Who the heck are you!? It ain't polite to barge into a chocobo corral, partner.
 7142: Don't talk like that to me, thief. I'm here to take back what's rightfully mine.
 7143: We don't house thieves here, mister. And I don't recall taking anyone's property.
 7144: This chocobo belongs to me. Can't you see the brand? Now give him back.
 7145: Wait, that means--Master, come quickly!
 7146: Mister, you may be a chocobo handler, but I reckon you handle 'em roughly!
 7147: So? You got a problem with that? Spoil your animals and they'll never obey.
 7148: You gotta instill 'em with fear! I mean, come on... They're just animals! You eat meat, don't you?
 7149: So don't lecture me over what I do with 'em.
 7150: Come on, let's go.
 7151: Kweh!
 7152: Lay off, mister! You're scaring him!
 7153: Yeah? Well, that's 'cause you've spoiled him rotten!
 7154: I'll be back for what's mine. You mark my words!
 7155: That kind of scum is the worst!
 7156: Ah, well. This doesn't really concern you.
 7157: So look, kiddo... You've got talent. This birdie here's almost yours. Keep up the good work, okay?
 7158: Aw, that brute doesn't scare me. Anyway...look at you! The master said you got talent! I'm so jealous.
 7159: You got the right stuff, kiddo. So I'm sure he'll learn to like you. Just keep at it and you'll have your $3 in no time.
 7160: Looks like he's used to you. He's not scared at all anymore.
 7161: Kweh! (He seems to be comfortable with you.)
 7162: Just a little bit more! Thanks to you, he's eating more, and his feathers have a healthier glow!
 7163: Kweh! (He's eating joyfully.)
 7164: Hah! I've never heard him squeal so happily!
 7165: Oh, sorry. He won't eat $6. But he might like $7 .
 7166: I'm sorry. Except for feeding time, the master scolds us when we give them $6. I know... It's the thought that counts.
 7167: Well, looks like he's used to you now!
 7168: Good job! Now you're a qualified chocobo rider.
 7169: Now that you can read animals' minds, maybe you can become a beastmaster. Of course, I can't teach you how... You'll just have to practice.
 7170: The rest is up to you, kiddo. For now, take this to the stables.
 7171: The rest is up to you, kiddo. For now, take this to the stables.
 7172: The master sure was profound, talking about reading their minds... At least we know the last owner didn't have that gift!
 7173: The master sure was profound, talking about reading their minds... At least we know the last owner didn't have that gift!
 7174: If you can read their minds, you might have what it takes to be a beastmaster. But no teachin' can help you there... No sirree!
 7175: Come to think of it, I wonder what happened to that cowardly chocobo handler?
 7176: Oh, haven't you heard? He's been home taking care of his son ever since he got sick.
 7177: Well, that's what he gets for treating his chocobos so badly. Serves him right!
 7178: What are you talking about? He was out of control, but his poor little boy never hurt anybody!
 7179: Yeah. you're right. I heard his kid was shocked at what his dad was doing, too.
 7180: Maybe if that brute was softer on his chocobos, his kid would get better. What do you think?
 7181: Well, look at who you're talking about. I don't think it's even possible... Feel bad about the kid, though.
 7182: Kweh!
 7183: Aw, what's the matter?
 7184: That was a sad chirp. Why are you so down all of a sudden?
 7185: Ha-ha! He's so docile now.
 7186: I'd hate to see him go, but maybe sending him back would be the best thing for him.
 7187: He just got up and ran away. We were so worried. He came right back, covered in mud. But I wonder where he went?
 7188: Why, howdy there! How you been, huh? You look fit as a fiddle! So, what can I...
 7189: Master!
 7190: Hey, what do you think you're...
 7191: Look, he's afraid of you!
 7192: Wait... He's happy about something. What could this mean?
 7193: There you are... Thank you! You're the reason my son's recovered.
 7194: I beat you and whipped you for so long. Why did you decide to help me?
 7195: Do you understand me? No, I can't thank you enough for all you've done for me. I truly thank you.
 7196: And you, too! Thanks.
 7197: I'm a beastmaster no more. But I bet you can become a great beastmaster if you keep at it.
 7198: And I'm sorry I said those things to you before.
 7199: Hey, don't worry about it.
 7200: I'm not worthy of chocobos anymore. Please, take care of him for me.
 7201: You got it. He'll grow up big and strong.
 7202: You stay right there.
 7203: Mark my words. Someday, he'll come back for his chocobo.
 7204: And the chocobo will gladly go with him. After all, he's a beastmaster.
 7205: All's well that ends well, right? Now you can call yourself a beastmaster. Stand tall, kiddo!
 7206: You can now become a beastmaster.
 7207: Aw, man! I wanna be a beastmaster someday, too!
 7208: What? Oh, that guy's kid got better? Well, that's good to hear. I'd like to have him over sometime.
 7209: Looks like no one's home.
 7210: Hi, Galmut!
 7211: Hey, Collet! Stay right there. I'm almost done!
 7212: Okay!
 7213: The clock is always spot on, thanks to Galmut. He gives the gears a good oiling each and every day.
 7214: Whew... Well, how've you been? You've been going to school, right?
 7215: Uh, yeah... Sorta.
 7216: Sorta? What's that supposed to mean? Sounds to me like you're playing hooky!
 7217: Yeah... But your voice always brings a smile to my face.
 7218: Is that so? Well, childhood ain't all about studying. Isn't that right?
 7219: $26$26$26$26$26$26Bell Rings$26$26$26$26$26$26
 7220: She's right on time! Heh, I maintain that clock.
 7221: At first it was a boring job, but now I see how fun it really is.
 7222: That clock needs lots of attention, or else she goes off right away. She's such a delicate creature.
 7223: Every time I hear her ring, I feel like I've woken this town up.
 7224: Every day, I see the same people pass by when I clean the gears, and they stop and wave hello.
 7225: Sometimes, when I don't see one of them, I start to worry if they're okay.
 7226: I had my eye on a certain girl...
 7227: Till one day, I saw her with some other guy. Man, that hurt.
 7228: Well, anyway... The longer I worked, the more I felt like I was actually helping everyone. That made me happy.
 7229: I'm having too much fun, aren't I?
 7230: Yeah, way too much!
 7231: Hey, I wasn't asking you.
 7232: Well, I'd better get home soon. Take care!
 7233: Nice meeting you. See you tomorrow!
 7234: Galmut's working on the clock. Don't interrupt him.
 7235: I'm so scared of school. I told Galmut I think everyone hates me. But he said that couldn't be true.
 7236: Oh, it's you... Sorry, but I'm right in the middle of something. Could you come back later?
 7237: Well, look who's here! Welcome to my humble abode.
 7238: I've got lots of wacky stuff, don't I?
 7239: Heh. They may be scrap, but they're all priceless things a certain person gave me.
 7240: Hey, what are you doin'? That's my bed!
 7241: Anybody home?
 7242: Well, speak of the devil... It's Mr. Narihira!
 7243: I see you're still kickin'.
 7244: Hah! You post-war youngsters ain't got nothin' on my generation!
 7245: Well, it's good to see you.
 7246: How's the clock, Galmut?
 7247: I've been taking good care of her. Don't tell me you can't hear her ring!
 7248: Huh? What did you say? Just kiddin'. Of course I hear her fine!
 7249: But I hear the gears struggling a little. Might be time to give her some oil.
 7250: Well, you haven't changed a bit!
 7251: And I see you've got a friend over!
 7252: Listen here, young one. Galmut's a model citizen now, but he was a regular hooligan before!
 7253: Oh, no, not that again!
 7254: Ohohoho! Defensive, aren't we? Anyway, Galmut came to Jeuno about three years ago...
 7255: He came to the big city to make his mark. Every day he worked from sunrise to sunset!
 7256: And when I finally got enough dough to open my own shop...
 7257: I got conned out of all of it. I lost every last gil...
 7258: And that really shook him! He lost faith in his fellow man...scowling at everyone like a starving dog.
 7259: That's when Mr. Narihira offered me a job in the clock tower.
 7260: At first I thought he was just another con man. But once I started, I really enjoyed it.
 7261: You know, you work so hard in there that when you finally hear the bell ring... Man, it echoes right to the heart!
 7262: And I was glad to find someone who'd carry on in my place.
 7263: Oh yeah... I almost forgot!
 7264: We need $6. And with the beastmen on the rampage, the store's almost out.
 7265: No way, really? Without oil, we...
 7266: Maybe the Tenshodo still has some. I hate doing business with their kind, though.
 7267: Me, too... Hey, I know! Would you mind bringing us $6?
 7268: We'd be so grateful. She's such a delicate machine... Without it, I'm afraid she'd go haywire!
 7269: Will you help them? [Yes./Not right now.]
 7270: All right! Thanks a bunch!
 7271: First, head over to the Tenshodo, here in Jeuno.
 7272: Oh, yeah? Well, tell me if you change your mind. We've gotta do something.
 7273: Oh, it's you. We still can't find any $3.
 7274: Mr. Narihira said that the Tenshodo has some. Without it, sooner or later the gears will come to a stop!
 7275: Who's there!?
 7276: Oh, you... Thanks for bringing the oil, but we don't need it anymore!
 7277: I heard they're gonna tear her down and make her into some kinda crane to lift cargo from ships.
 7278: The plan's already passed. Ain't nothing I can do now!
 7279: Well, I'll go ahead and take that $3. Thanks for trying, [pal/though]. This is for you.
 7280: I try to believe in something, and look what happens!
 7281: Galmut, it's me! You here?
 7282: Oh, it's you. Where's Galmut?
 7283: He's out, huh? And he heard about the clock? He must've been shocked.
 7284: That's Galmut for you. Look, if we get enough signatures with $6, we might be able to stop the plan!
 7285: They're going to take down the clock. Narihira said we could get $6 from the Chamber of Commerce and Industry but I don't know what he means.
 7286: Galmut was so shocked. But there's nothing I can do. He's the one who always cheers me up.
 7287: Galmut won't come out, no matter how much I call for him. I wonder what's wrong...
 7288: But the clock seem to be working all right. I wonder who's keeping it running... It's one of the seven wonders of Jeuno!
 7289: Huh? You want me to sign? If it'll help Galmut, you bet!
 7290: What's that?
 7291: What!? You've...
 7292: I heard somebody started a petition. But it was you? Galmut should be happy to have such a good friend.
 7293: I wonder where he ran off to, anyway. How pathetic!
 7294: Everyone's out to get me! It's all over!
 7295: Mr. Narihira... And you... What are you doing here?
 7296: Shut your trap and listen for once! Your friend here's gathered so many signatures, the petition to save the clock tower was a success!
 7297: Huh? Petition? Does that mean her gears'll keep turning?
 7298: Of course, you fool! Right now, you're the stopped clock.
 7299: You know what that means, don'tcha? No more resounding rings. Catch my drift, sonny?
 7300: Mr. Narihira... I'm sorry.
 7301: Hell, I don't care how you feel!
 7302: You gotta face all the people out there who count on that clock! Without the bells each day...
 7303: Ugh...
 7304: Mr. Narihira!
 7305: Oh, I'm all right. I just kept the clock going while you were gone. And by golly, I was rustier than she was!
 7306: I don't know how to thank you. Nobody's ever cared enough to talk straight to me.
 7307: Hah! What kinda moron likes getting chewed out!?
 7308: Besides, I think there's someone else you should be thankin'. Your precious clock'd be scrap if it weren't for [him/her].
 7309: I don't know what to say... Or how to thank you... This ain't much, but it means a lot to me. Please, I want you to have it.
 7310: I'm so grateful. I'll make sure nothing ever happens to that clock, because it's what binds all the people together.
 7311: I believe you, Galmut.
 7312: Well, you got your work cut out for you. Get to it, kiddo!
 7313: Hi, Galmut!
 7314: Hey, Collet! I gotta stay and finish up.. And is that <Player> next to you? Thanks to you, I know how happy I am!
 7315: Galmut's got back into the swing of things. And I'm feeling better, too! Hmm, I think I'll head back to school again.
 7316: Oh, it's you, huh? Galmut's workin' hard as ever, thanks to you. Do me a favor and check up on him once in a while, okay?
 7317: Hmm, maybe I could ask [him/her]... Oh, it's nothing! Never mind.
 7318: Say, are you heading to Davoi?
 7319: Then you'll need this $3. You can't break the inner seal without it.
 7320: I want to trade this for $6. What do you say?
 7321: Will you bring me $6? [I'll do it for the crest./Not right now.]
 7322: All right! Thanks! You can find coeurls on the Sauromugue Champaign.
 7323: Aw, man! Well, come back if you change your mind.
 7324: Did you find $6? I've heard there are coeurls on the Sauromugue Champaign. Be careful!
 7325: Ah, yes! This is what I need. Thanks!
 7326: Alrighty. Here's the $3, just like I promised.
 7327: What? You want to know what I'm going to use this $6 for?
 7328: To tell you the truth, my sister's not well.
 7329: Hey, Audia... It's me. Remember?
 7330: I want meat! Bring me $6, drenched in bright red blood!
 7331: Quickly... Make haste or I'll devour you!
 7332: Okay, okay... I brought you some, so don't give me that evil look anymore!
 7333: Ahahaha... Such delicious-looking meat. The fat, so perfectly marbled!
 7334: Aumfch... Mmmm! Ahh... Fresh meat!
 7335: My sister was so nice before she got sick. She was so looking forward to marrying Albrecht.
 7336: But one day, after she came back from a picnic with Alista, she got a headache and stayed in bed. Then, she got like that.
 7337: Everybody says she's under some kind of curse. Albrecht's been praying at the temple every day, hoping for relief.
 7338: I heard the crest would lift the curse, but it didn't work either.
 7339: But I don't think she's cursed at all! She's never done anything bad to get cursed like that!
 7340: Oh, Audia...
 7341: I don't like to show her like this, but I don't know what to do anymore.
 7342: That fianc<Player>i of hers, Albrecht, is always at the temple.
 7343: Well? Any news?
 7344: Did you learn anything about her sickness? [Nope, nothing./As a matter of fact...]
 7345: Really? Well, thanks for trying.
 7346: Don't bother. I know you're just trying to cheer me up.
 7347: Hey, Baudin. How's she doing?
 7348: She's still the same, Albrecht.
 7349: Really... Well, it's only a matter of time, since I pray for her each and every day.
 7350: No way! She won't get better!
 7351: Baudin, what are you saying?
 7352: She's never done anything bad! It can't be a curse. You can pray all you want, but she won't get better!
 7353: What's gotten into you? I'll come back later. Try to settle down and compose yourself before I get back.
 7354: Baudin, what is it? You were so deep in thought, you didn't see me, did you?
 7355: No, it's nothing.
 7356: Okay, that's fine, then. So, how is she?
 7357: No change, really. I wonder... Did you see anything strange when you two went out picnicking?
 7358: No, nothing at all.
 7359: I think she'll get better.
 7360: Yeah, I hope so.
 7361: Well, try to cheer up!
 7362: Okay?
 7363: Hmm... There must be something I can do!
 7364: I wish I knew what to do... If you ever find a cure for my sister, please let me know.
 7365: Oh, you think that could cure her? I heard it's a terrible place, so be very, very careful. I'll pray for your safety!
 7366: What? This might be a cure? Thanks so much! Now, hurry!
 7367: All right... Audia, you'll feel better in no time!
 7368: Wait, Baudin! That's no cure. It'll make her worse!
 7369: Albrecht? And Alista... How do you know that?
 7370: My sister told me.
 7371: I-I'm so sorry. I knew how to cure her sickness.
 7372: Wh-what!? What's going on?
 7373: When we went out that day, I saw a ghost come and possess her. I knew we had to exorcise her...
 7374: I'm so sorry. I didn't want to lose my brother to her.
 7375: That's why I kept my mouth shut. I hoped that if Audia never recovered, then my brother would give up someday.
 7376: But I was wrong. He really, really loves her. Now I know.
 7377: And I couldn't see Audia suffer anymore. Please, forgive me!
 7378: I...
 7379: Baudin, I want you to forgive us both. I knew that Alista hated Audia, but I didn't suspect a thing.
 7380: Even if you don't forgive us, please, give this to Audia now!
 7381: What's this? And how...?
 7382: It should chase the spirit away. Monsters there wounded me, but my pain is nothing compared to what Audia has suffered.
 7383: Albrecht, Alista... It's okay. I believe you.
 7384: Audia, Albrecht ventured into the maw of peril to find a cure for you. Now, I want you to try hard and get better!
 7385: Ngraarrr! Damn you all! You found it!? URRRNGAHHH!!!
 7386: Uhh... Whew...
 7387: Huh!? Where am... Oh, I'm home? What... What's happened to me?
 7388: Audia!
 7389: Baudin, what's going on? Now, now... Don't cry.
 7390: My dear Audia... It's all right. Everything's fine.
 7391: Audia!
 7392: What are you all doing here? I can't remember anything!
 7393: Forgive me! Please, forgive me!
 7394: Alista, don't be afraid. Just because they marry, it doesn't mean you'll be alone all of a sudden.
 7395: What?
 7396: You'll come live with us, right?
 7397: Wait... You'll really forgive what I did?
 7398: Of course! I think I know how you feel.
 7399: I'm so sorry, Audia. I should never have let that happen to you.
 7400: Baudin...
 7401: And you, stranger. I thank you.
 7402: I simply refused to face reality. I am ashamed...
 7403: I forgot that we must first do what we are capable of, before we seek divine help.
 7404: There are times when we face adversity, yet still must do something.
 7405: Through prayer, we gain the strength and hope to go on. But then we must take action!
 7406: This is for you. For trying to help Audia, and for making me realize the truth. Use it well!
 7407: Baudin, let me take care of Audia now. I'll never let this kind of thing happen to her ever again. I promise!
 7408: Please, Baudin. I beg you!
 7409: No, it's okay! I know you can take good care of her.
 7410: Thank you, Baudin.
 7411: Audia...
 7412: Oh, Albrecht...
 7413: Looks like she's okay now. Thanks for helping us out. It's been forever since I've seen her smile.
 7414: What? The clock tower!? Galmut once showed me inside. It was dark and grimy and smelled like oil, but Galmut knew it inside and out.
 7415: You bet I'll sign! Also, here's a secret: Galmut used to have a crush on my sister!
 7416: Oh, hello there. You won't find anything here but memories long gone. Young, sprightly folk like yourself would likely die of boredom!
 7417: Hello. I always come and help Ilumida. She has problems with her back, and really can't live on her own anymore.
 7418: The war may be over, but the pain is everlasting. Ilumida lost her husband, and people like her suffer each and every day.
 7419: Jeuno seems like a lively place, but look deeper and you'll find scars that linger. War is indeed a terrible thing.
 7420: Oh, a visitor? What can I do for you?
 7421: I am looking for Ilumida. Is she here?
 7422: I wonder who that could be. Excuse me, please.
 7423: Why, it's Wolfgang! Come in, come in.
 7424: I'm glad to see you're doing well. Here, let me give you this month's payment.
 7425: Thanks, as always, Wolfgang. You know how grateful I am.
 7426: No, it's what my father wanted.
 7427: I do appreciate it, though. How about something to drink? I've got some fine tea today.
 7428: Thanks, Ilumida, but I must go. Maybe later I'll have time to visit.
 7429: Oh? That's too bad. Well, take care, Wolfgang!
 7430: Always at your service, madam.
 7431: Wolfgang's father, Brandolf, was a soldier, too. He fought for Jeuno's freedom long before the archduke's reign.
 7432: And my husband served under him. But in the wars that followed... When he was about Wolfgang's age...
 7433: His father, Brandolf, died from wounds he received in battle. Before he died, he ordered funds to be paid out to people like me.
 7434: Well, who am I to lecture about this to a stranger? I'm sorry.
 7435: Well, now I suppose I must go give word.
 7436: I thought there was a candle around here...
 7437: Oh, dear... It seems I'm right out of candles!
 7438: Would you mind running to the temple and picking one up for me? At my age, even short walks leave me quite out of breath.
 7439: Will you bring $6? [At once./Not yet.]
 7440: Oh, what a kind soul! I'll be waiting here.
 7441: Oh, of course. You must have so many things to attend to. I'll find someone else.
 7442: I think the Temple of the Goddess should have some candles. I know it's a bother, but would you mind fetching one?
 7443: Oh, splendid. Now I can tell my husband. And for you, here's a little something for your trouble.
 7444: It's not much, but I believe it will watch over you in times of need. Come, don't be shy... Take it!
 7445: It's been so long since my husband died in the war. This was a small house for two of us, and it's always seemed so big with just me.
 7446: Well, feel free to stop by if you're ever in the neighborhood. I've always got a pot of tea ready for company.
 7447: And thank you so much. My husband must be very pleased. Don't be a stranger, all right?
 7448: Hah! You're wasting your time!
 7449: I'm helping Verena and Fickie grow flowers. We water them every-wevery day. I sure hope they bloom soon!
 7450: Yeah, right. No way seeds from beastmen'll ever grow.
 7451: Nuh-uh! They'll grow!
 7452: Yuh-huh! My daddy said that beastmen are gonna start another war! Fickie's the enemy!
 7453: Nuh-uh! Fickie's our friend!
 7454: Fickie told us that when they bloom, it means that people and beasty-weastymen can be friends. I was surprised to hear that, 'specially from a gobbie-wobbie!
 7455: I know they'll bloom. I'm gonna make them.
 7456: Just you watch them wither and die.
 7457: Hi, Fickie! Hi, Verena!
 7458: So, still no sprout, huh?
 7459: I know, it's such a bummer-wummer. I water them every-wevery day, though!
 7460: They'll never grow.
 7461: Water 'em all you want. No way Fickie's seeds'll ever sprout here in Jeuno. Ever!
 7462: Look, why don't you just hush! You never know till you try.
 7463: Oh! You're always on Fickie's side, aren't ya?
 7464: I think they'll sprout.
 7465: Huh?
 7466: Everyone talks to me now that I've planted them. That makes me so happy.
 7467: So, even if the flowers never bloom, it was still good.
 7468: Fickie...
 7469: Whatever!
 7470: I have to get back to Muck's. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
 7471: Take care, Fickblix. I'm going home, too.
 7472: I hope they sprouty-wout tomorrow! Bye!
 7473: Thanks for everything.
 7474: And thanks for bringing the fertilizer, Geebeh.
 7475: Whatever! I'm not doing it for you.
 7476: Since Fickie left, I don't see Verena around anymore. Even the Tenshodo guys won't talky-walk to me.
 7477: He's a loser! He ran away before the flowers bloomed at all! That's not fair!
 7478: I'm tellin' you to sprout! You're our flowers! Ours and Fickie's! Now sprout, darnit!
 7479: Hold on, Geebeh. Take a looky-wooky at this!
 7480: Oh, what now? Is that...a sprout!? It's sprouting?
 7481: That's right, Geebeh! You can't tell just by looking, but it's started to sprouty-wout under the dirt!
 7482: We planted those seeds! Us and Fickie! And now they're sprouting!
 7483: Give this to Verena. Tell her the flowers that we planted with Fickie have started to sprouty-wout!
 7484: I'm sure they're gonna bloom big!
 7485: I hope we can plant lots of seeds, and people and beasty-weastymen can get along, like Fickie said.

 7487: Our valued customers: It's always a special day at our tavern.
 7488: It seems you're not welcome today.
 7489: It seems you're welcome today.
 7490: Enter the tavern? [Yes./No, not now.]
 7491: Exit the tavern? [Yes./Not quite yet.]
 7492: I'm sorry, but we're going to have to ask you to leave.

 7547: Aren't scholars swell? The way they utilize both white and black magic, not to mention their other abilities, really gets you to thinking, doesn't it?
 7548: Aren't geomancers swell? They can support their allies, weaken their enemies, and blast people into the past with powerful elemental magic! It makes me wonder, "What can't they do?"
 7549: Aren't rune fencers swell? Their runes aren't just pretty to look at, they're also what makes them such graceful combative technicians. I swoon every time I see one in action.

 7557: Welcome to our humble shop!
 7558: Hello. Welcome to the Marble Bridge. Each day we have a new entrance policy. So, enjoy talking with your peers.
 7559: I'm sorry, but it's time for you to go. Please come again!
 7560: Huh? A petition to save the clock tower? Where do I sign? So this is why Galmut looked so worried when he stopped by a while ago.
 7561: That Galmut... He's always pestering us to have a clock workers' day. I tell him nobody would come except for him and Mr. Narihira.
 7562: ***Today the Marble Bridge welcomes all [San d'Orians/Bastokers/Windurstians/warriors/monks/white mages/black mages/red mages/thieves/paladins/dark knights/beastmasters/bards/rangers/samurais/ninjas/dragoons/summoners/blue mages/corsairs/puppetmasters/dancers/scholars/geomancers/rune fencers/Humes/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Mithra/Galka/gentlemen/ladies]!***
 7563: <Player>, could I ask you a favor?
 7564: You know that our motto is "every day is a special day," right? Well, lately I've been hearing lots of rumors about how confusing our entrance policies are.
 7565: What do you think? [No problems at all./They are pretty confusing...]
 7566: Hah, you don't have to be nice. I know what you're really thinking.
 7567: Hmmm... So you think so too... Well, then I guess that it's time to do something!
 7568: And that's why I've come up with this plan. I've made up a batch of these special $5 that will let you know if today's your "special day" the moment you enter Upper Jeuno.
 7569: Ah ha! I knew you'd be back! Can't live without $6, can you?
 7570: How much? No! I wouldn't think of charging one of my best customers for something like this!
 7571: What do you say? [I'll take one!/Thanks, but no thanks.]
 7572: Wonderful! Remember, if you think that you no longer need the coaster, just come back and I'll take it off your hands.
 7573: Oh... Well, if you ever change your mind, just come back any time. I've made up hundreds of these things!
 7574: How do you like the $3? Pretty useful, huh?
 7575: What do you think? [I want to return the coaster./I can't live without my coaster!]
 7576: You want to return it!? Well, I can't force you to carry it around... You know what they say, "The customer is always right." But if you ever need another one, you know where to come!
 7577: Heh heh! I knew you'd say that!
 7578: You return the $3.
 7579: Greetings! We deal in all sorts of armor. They say the best defense is a good offense, but it never hurts to play it safe.
 7580: I know it sounds obvious, but a good suit of armor can save your life.
 7581: Hello! We've got everything from double-edged swords to big, two-handed axes.
 7582: Hello. How about some produce from Aragoneu?
 7583: I've got produce from Ronfaure!
 7584: Hello. Gustaberg produce for sale!
 7585: Fresh produce from Fauregandi!
 7586: Looking for Derfland produce?
 7587: How about some fresh goods from Norvallen?
 7588: Long ago, the Goddess Altana took pity on the barren world of Vana'diel and shed five tears. Our ancestors sprouted from each one.
 7589: But the god Promathia saw this, and condemned her work. He cursed all her people to eternal conflict among each other.
 7590: Altana would not be pleased to see us now, squabbling over our petty causes. Please, at least while you are here, shun conflict and pray for peace.
 7591: The candles made here are blessed with a special prayer: "May this holy light cleanse the world of shadow."
 7592: Say, you here for business? This town's a mecca for merchants, you know, since all roads lead to Jeuno!
 7593: People come full of hope, with great dreams and plans for the future. Our free city is a melting pot for all mankind!
 7594: But not everybody. Some just pick up and head for home. Where there is light, there is shadow. That's Jeuno!
 7595: You know, Wolfgang has changed so much ever since he became captain of the guard. It's like he's always wearing a mask. He never smiles anymore.
 7596: He even gives his old pal Monberaux the cold shoulder. Just who does he think he is!
 7597: Somewhere out there, my nemesis awaits... Her power is so great, I tremble just mentioning her.
 7598: Yes, only the sturdiest mail could save me from her terrible strikes! Armor should always be carefully chosen!
 7599: Hey, have you seen my good-for-nothing husband anywhere? I know he's cheating on me!
 7600: Once I get my hands on him I'll mash him into a bloody pulp! Now, which weapon would inflict the most pain... We must choose our weapons carefully!
 7601: Glory be to Altana! Ever does she watch over her flock.
 7602: If you find yourself in need, pray to her. Only through her divine light can we see the truth.
 7603: You know, this pub's got different requirements to get in every day. Like on Tarutaru Day, only Tarutaru can get intaru!
 7604: So whenever you're there, you can talk with your peers... You know? I always have a blast, so try it outaru!
 7605: I've never lost a fight here. This town is full of wimps!
 7606: How dare that Panta send me a challenge! I bet he's still fuming over that beating I gave him.
 7607: I wonder what Panta's gonna bring this time. Eh, won't help that pipsqueak anyway.
 7608: Hah! That Panta's still at it.. Well, I don't care. He'll never beat me with this kind of stuff!
 7609: Oh, yeah. The Goblins were carrying Panta's Cardian to the doctor's. I wonder what's going on...
 7610: Panta never cries after he loses a fight, but he was bawling after he left the doctor's. Maybe he had a cavity?
 7611: Panta said he's gonna give up fighting. Geez, what a coward! I think I'm gonna miss him.
 7612: Would you like to see a map of Jeuno?
 7613: Well? [I suppose./No, thank you.]
 7614: You are currently in Upper Jeuno, one level below the very top.
 7615: Upper Jeuno is known for its many artisans! And who could forget the clock tower, the greatest symbol of crrraftsmanship!
 7616: Everrryone's proud of its accuracy. It's so cutting-edge!
 7617: Welcome to Upper Jeuno! This neighborhood lacks pizzaz, but more than makes up for it with its great industrial enterprises.
 7618: A lot of stubborn people live here, but don't worry, since they're nice once you get to know them.
 7619: Behold! Jeuno's residential structure towers above the city! Without it, where would all of Jeuno's visitors stay?
 7620: Atop stand Ru'Lude Gardens, the Auroral Palace and the embassies. Great is the awe that place inspires!
 7621: You always check the merchandise before you decide what to craft, right?
 7622: But in Jeuno, you can buy goods from anywhere, anytime! Me, I always end up checking it all!
 7623: The master of this chocobo stable is famous! It is an honor to ride a bird here.
 7624: I want to have one of the chocobos for my own, but the master's stubborn! I wonder if he'll ever say yes.
 7625: I often forget that we live above the ocean. A long time ago these brrridges were just ruins. I don't know how travelers made it anywhere back then.
 7626: But once the brrridges were rebuilt, this town really began to grow. Our ancestors would be proud, I'm sure.
 7627: Something has been irking me for quite some time. Would you hear me out?
 7628: Will you listen? [Yes./Not now.]
 7629: You see, chocobos have wings, do they not? But they cannot fly! So they cannot really be birds, can they?
 7630: Everyone thinks about such things before they learn to accept them. But I think it's good to question.
 7631: I will be up all night thinking about this!
 7632: I haul up cargo from the ships with those cranes, and move it all into the warehouse.
 7633: But those cranes just don't cut it anymore. I could sure use at least one more...
 7634: It's not easy to see the archduke. But people who have say he's different. Like he's got this...aura...
 7635: I wish I could see him. That way, I could find out if it's true!
 7636: Long have I hoarded my gil, and the time for purchase is at hand! But shall I buy weaponry or armor?
 7637: In offense the best defense may lie, but quickly is the unarmored knight struck down. Hmm... Which to choose...
 7638: Move itaru! I want to join the Ducal Guards! Must...march...more...
 7639: Master, Master! I have a favor to ask, kupo!
 7640: Sleeping on that $3 has made me homesick, kupo. Will my benevolent master give [his/her] moogle some time off to visit with Mama and Papa Moogle, kupo?
 7641: Give your moogle a vacationH [Sure, kupo! /No, your time is mine!]
 7642: Oh, what a cruel, cruel master, kupo!!!
 7643: Thank you, kupo! I...have one more favor to ask. It's almost time for the festival in the moogles' hometown, kupo!
 7644: Papa Moogle will be entering the archery contest, so I want to bring him $5 as a gift, kupo!
 7645: Mama Moogle always likes to dress up for the occasion, and $6 would make the perfect present, kupo!
 7646: But I have no idea how to go about finding $5 or $6, kupo... I can't go home empty-handed, kupo...
 7647: Papa Moogle will be entering the archery contest, so I want to bring him $5 as a gift, kupo!
 7648: Mama Moogle always likes to dress up for the occasion, and $6 would make the perfect present, kupo!
 7649: But I have no idea how to go about finding $5 or $6, kupo... I can't go home empty-handed, kupo...
 7650: Master! I'm overwhelmed by your kindness, kupo!!!
 7651: I'll bring you a nice present from the moogles' hometown, kupo! I'll be back in a few days, kupo!
 7652: Master! I'm back from my vacation, kupo!
 7653: Here's your present--a shiny new Mog Safe, kupo! Now you can store as many as 60 items, kupo!
 7654: Looking at that shabby old bed makes me feel homesick, kupo. Will my benevolent master give [his/her] moogle some time off to visit with Mama and Papa Moogle, kupo?
 7655: Master, Master! I have a favor to ask, kupo!
 7656: Sleeping on that $3 has made me homesick, kupo. Will my benevolent master give [his/her] moogle some time off to visit with Mama and Papa Moogle, kupo?
 7657: Give your moogle a vacationH [Sure, kupo! /No, your time is mine!]
 7658: Thank you, kupo! I have one more favor to ask... I want to take my family on a picnic, kupo!
 7659: Papa Moogle is mad for fishing, so I want to give him $5, kupo!
 7660: Mama Moogle would bake a scrumptious mooglepie to take with us, but she'd need $6, kupo!
 7661: But...I haven't the foggiest idea of how to get either of these things, kupo... Whatever am I to do, kupo?
 7662: Papa Mog is mad for fishing, so I want to give him $5, kupo!
 7663: Mama Moogle would bake a scrumptious mooglepie to take with us, but she'd need $6, kupo!
 7664: But...I haven't the foggiest idea of how to get either of these things, kupo... Whatever am I to do, kupo?
 7665: Master! I'm overwhelmed by your kindness, kupo!!!
 7666: I'll bring you a nice present from the moogles' hometown, kupo! I'll be back in a few days, kupo!
 7667: Master! I'm back from my vacation, kupo!
 7668: Here's your present--the behemoth of Mog Safes, kupo! Now you can store as many as 70 items, kupo!
 7669: The capacity of your Mog Safe has increased!
 7670: Master, Master! I have a favor to ask, kupo!
 7671: After resting on the $3, I noticed a letter had arrived from some old moogle friends, kupo! Will my magnanimous master give me some time off to go visit my old buddies?
 7672: Give your moogle some time off? [Have fun, kupo!/No, I am your only friend now!]
 7673: Oh, thank you, master! My moogle friends live across the seas, so I have another favor to ask you, kupo!
 7674: The sun beats down mercilessly in the land beyond the west sea, so I need to take $5 for my friends there, kupo!
 7675: And my other buddies need $6 for the torrential rains that scour the lands across the east sea, kupo!
 7676: I can't help out my friends if I don't have $5 and $6, kupo...
 7677: I'll be sure to bring you a souvenir from my overseas trip, kupo! See you in a few days, master!
 7678: Master! I'm back from visiting my old moogle friends, kupo!
 7679: We all got together and made you a new Mog Safe, kupo! Now you can store as many as 80 items, kupo!
 7680: So many people greeted us warmly in our journeys together. They laughed with us, and cheered for us.
 7681: Nothing about their joy was false. And hearing them was my greatest happiness. But I have forgotten that, and now I cling to the past.
 7682: If you were here... If only you were here, I could relive the happiness of those days.
 7683: Hello. Head to the counter for service.
 7684: I was hired to craft armor for this shop, but all I ever do is watch over the inventory.
 7685: I wanted to hone my skills repairing armor. But boy, was I wrong! Armor is never repaired anymore, it's replaced!
 7686: Not so with the works of old! No, they were precious, and were often kept for generations.
 7687: Of those, the most famous were the Lost Hands of Borghertz. You have heard of Borghertz, haven't you?
 7688: Do you want to hear about Borghertz? [Yes, tell me./No, thank you.]
 7689: Thirty years ago, the legendary craftsman Borghertz wrought gauntlets, one pair for each job.
 7690: So great was his craft, they say he must have sold his spirit to fiends. His gauntlets were strong as steel, but light as a feather!
 7691: But, those masterpieces were lost in the great war twenty years ago.
 7692: Oh? It seems all adventurers know of him and his gauntlets.
 7693: Of course, it's all hearsay. Much is told of Borghertz, but most of it is just legend.
 7694: I once met a man who found a pair of Borghertz's gauntlets. And where there's smoke, there's fire.
 7695: The hands of Borghertz were lost in the war, but people say they now rest somewhere in [a dungeon somewhere/the Eldieme Necropolis/the Crawlers' Nest/Beadeaux/Garlaige Citadel/the Eldieme Necropolis/Davoi/the Eldieme Necropolis/the Eldieme Necropolis/the Crawlers' Nest/Castle Zvahl/Garlaige Citadel/the Kuftal Tunnel/Ifrit's Cauldron/the Boyahda Tree/the Sea Serpent Grotto].
 7696: Well, you can believe what you want, but don't go trumpeting to the customers. Now, I must get back to work!
 7697: That's about all I know. You can go search that dungeon for yourself if you've got nothing better to do.
 7698: We artisans believe that artifacts like the hands of Borghertz still rest in dungeons across Vana'diel. An adventurer like you should be able to find them.
 7699: Much is told of Borghertz, but it's all just a legend. Don't let greed cloud your judgment.
 7700: Could it be!? Why, they're soiled and rusty, but the craftsmanship! Indeed these are the work of Borghertz!
 7701: But they are beyond my skill. I cannot repair them.
 7702: Wait. I heard that a Mithra working for the Tenshodo acquired a strange toolbox long ago.
 7703: Some mysterious device held it shut; nobody could open it!
 7704: Even if it held some magical tool, I doubt anybody has the skill to repair these gauntlets.
 7705: You found the gauntlets? Amazing!
 7706: So, I have seen the hands of Borghertz. I'm glad I work here now!
 7707: I must strive for greatness, too! Someday I'll be known as a legendary craftsman!
 7708: You obtain $6.
 7709: So, how ya been? What, do I look sad? Well, one of my chocobos passed away.
 7710: No, don't worry. It wasn't the one you saved. He's still kickin'!
 7711: It was the oldest bird in my flock. I got her way back when I was just learning, like you are now.
 7712: She was getting up there, after all. It's so sad to see one of your own go. You're a beastmaster. You understand, right?
 7713: Oh, that's right! If you're looking for work, I've got something for ya! I need someone to get $6 from Delkfutt's Tower.
 7714: What do you say? I need someone to get $6 that's hidden somewhere inside Delkfutt's Tower.
 7715: They say that a chocobo who wears one will go straight to Paradise. I never believe in such things except in times like these!
 7716: Do you accept? [Of course I do./Well, not right now.]
 7717: Thanks! I'm so sad over her death that I can't even muster the will to get out there myself.
 7718: Don't worry about it. Come back if you change your mind.
 7719: I've never see him look so depressed. But I guess it makes sense. Chocobos are like family to us!
 7720: When I think that someday I'll be parted from this chocobo... Oh, it's so sad!
 7721: Please, find $6 hidden somewhere in Delkfutt's Tower.
 7722: Now we're talking! This'll make the chocobo's spirit happy! Here, this is all I have to give.
 7723: She may be gone, but her memory will always be here with us.
 7724: Hello there! You gettin' along with your animals? Of course you are! I can tell just by lookin' at ya!
 7725: Matter of fact, I got something else I wanna ask ya. Just listen, okay?
 7726: You know about the war twenty years ago, right? They called up all kinds of animals for duty, and a lot of 'em didn't make it.
 7727: So, to help calm their spirits, I want you to find three ponds in Fei'Yin. Once there, toss $6 into each one of 'em.
 7728: What do you say? It's all we can do to help the spirits of the fallen beasts rest in peace.
 7729: Well? How 'bout it? [I'll do it./No, I'm too busy right now.]
 7730: I thought you'd say that. Here, take these. And remember, this is serious business!
 7731: Well, you already know it won't be easy, so I can't make ya go, kiddo. I don't know any other beastmasters to turn to!
 7732: Find the three ponds of Fei'Yin and toss $6 into each one of 'em. This is a serious task, so no monkeyin' around!
 7733: You are given three sprigs of $3.
 7734: Why, thanks a gillion! I'm sure the spirit of that fallen animal can rest peacefully now.
 7735: What, you saw a ghost there? In a place like that?
 7736: Oh, yeah... I heard somethin' strange while you were away... Somethin' about the ghost of an Opo-opo in Castle Oztroja.
 7737: They say that it doesn't attack, so maybe it was domesticated before it died. As a beastmaster you wanna know more, right?
 7738: Maybe it is one that died in the war... I'd be grateful if you could go look into that. I'll have a reward for you when you get back.
 7739: Did you know that one of the street performers who used to come here was a beastmaster. Everyone loved his Opo-opo!
 7740: Somehow he made his Opo-opo do all kinds of things. I wish I could command this chocobo like that!
 7741: Anyway, his Opo-opo loved his spiffy collar. I think that the little bugger was named Tebhi.
 7742: I heard that $0 is hidden somewhere deep inside Castle Oztroja! Huh? You don't know what that is?
 7743: It's a really nice collar. I bet our chocobos would love to wear one, but maybe that one isn't for chocobos.
 7744: So, did that ghost finally go to rest? That's good. Here, I want you to have this.
 7745: But I still wonder... What was that Opo-opo spirit doing there?
 7746: Huh? 6? Nobody uses them anymore. But, if you bring me $1, I'll make it for you.
 7747: Good. $1 like this should work. Hang on a second.
 7748: There, it's done! Not bad if I say so myself. But what are you going to use this for?
 7749: Not bad if I say so myself. What are you going to use it for?
 7750: Looks like the old wounds have healed. War's an awful thing, so we can't let it happen again. The animals would thank us, too.
 7751: That street performer must have been a fantastic person! I want to be like him when I grow up!
 7752: Even when they're gone forever, your memory of them stays. I want to treasure every moment with this chocobo.
 7753: Good luck, [citizen/comrade]. I will bestow upon you your nation's Signet.
 7754: I cannot help you. You should go find a guard from your own country.
 7755: I cannot accept crystals from someone whose rank is still 1. I advise you to either keep them until your reach rank 2, or to use them in craftwork.
 7756: Since we are allied with San d'Oria...
 7757: Since we are allied with Bastok...
 7758: Since we are allied with Windurst...
 7759: I am sorry. I am too busy with other matters to be speaking with you.
 7760: Ah, you have brought us supplies. These will help us indeed. I thank you.
 7761: Hmm... These supplies you have brought us are too old to be of any use. We will dispose of them promptly. I do commend you for your effort. May you succeed next time.
 7762: You've earned conquest points!
 7763: You've received your nation's Signet. You are now taking part in your nation's conquest campaign!
 7764: I am %, a Temple Knight. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing San d'Oria's conquest campaign.
 7765: I am %, an Iron Musketeer. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Bastok's conquest campaign.
 7766: I am %, a War Warlock. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Windurst's conquest campaign.
 7767: What is your business? [Would you cast Signet on me?/I want to spend my conquest points./[I want to join the Expeditionary Force./Teleport me to the E.F. area.]/I want to quit the E.F./change my E.F./I want to go on a supplies quest./I have some questions.../Nothing, sorry to bother you.]
 7768: What do you wish to know about? [Nothing./Conquests./Conquest results./Donating crystals./Conquest points./The effects of controlling regions./Regions controlled by other nations./Regions under beastman control.]
 7769: All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call "conquests." You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.
 7770: Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.
 7771: Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.
 7772: So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.
 7773: Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control. They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.
 7774: Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.
 7775: Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.
 7776: So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike. We expect you to do your best to serve your country.
 7777: You can see the current state of conquests by selecting "Region Info" from the main menu. Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.
 7778: Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank. The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.
 7779: You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2. Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.
 7780: We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on. Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.
 7781: You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet. Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.
 7782: Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.
 7783: You also receive rank points for completing missions. Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.
 7784: You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests. Select "Region Info" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.
 7785: You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.
 7786: When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.
 7787: If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.
 7788: Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.
 7789: Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.
 7790: Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.
 7791: As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.
 7792: But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.
 7793: Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions. If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.
 7794: If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.
 7795: The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.
 7796: We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.
 7797: There is one outpost in each region. Select "Region Info" from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.
 7798: Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete. Now, choose which outpost you want to go to. We give different rewards for each region, so choose carefully.
 7799: Where do you wish to take the supplies? [@/@/@/@/@/The Ronfaure Region.[/ (Done)]/The Zulkheim Region.[/ (Done)]/The Norvallen Region.[/ (Done)]/The Gustaberg Region.[/ (Done)]/The Derfland Region.[/ (Done)]/The Sarutabaruta Region.[/ (Done)]/The Kolshushu Region.[/ (Done)]/The Aragoneu Region.[/ (Done)]/The Fauregandi Region.[/ (Done)]/The Valdeaunia Region.[/ (Done)]/Qufim Island.[/ (Done)]/The Li'Telor Region.[/ (Done)]/The Kuzotz Region.[/ (Done)]/The Vollbow Region.[/ (Done)]/The Elshimo Lowlands Region.[/ (Done)]/The Elshimo Uplands Region.[/ (Done)]/Tu'Lia.[/ (Done)]/@/The Tavnazian Archipelago.[/ (Done)]/@/@/@/@/@/@/@/Cancel.]

 7801: So be it. You have until the next conquest results announcement to complete this mission. Good luck.
 7802: We will dispose of those unusable supplies.
 7803: You can only undertake one supply mission per day. Come back later.
 7804: I am sorry. We seem to have a problem. Let me cancel it.
 7805: You do not need to donate any more crystals at your current rank. Speak to the guard at the gatehouse for further instructions.
 7806: Your rank points are full. We've added the excess to your conquest points. You do not need to donate any more crystals. Go to the gatehouse for further instructions.
 7807: Good work, citizen. We've awarded you rank points for the crystals you've donated.
 7808: You currently have $0 conquest points. Would you like to use them to purchase items?
 7809: Which item do you wish to purchase? [Common items (all ranks)./1000-pt. items (rank 1 required)."000-pt. items (rank 2 required)./4000-pt. items (rank 3 required)./8000-pt. items (rank 4 required)./16000-pt. items (rank 5 required)."4000-pt. items (rank 6 required)."2000-pt. items (rank 7 required)./40000-pt. items (rank 8 required)./48000-pt. items (rank 9 required)./56000-pt. items (rank 10 required)./Cancel.]

 7811: Currently there are no items available for that rank.
 7812: Due to its special nature, you can only purchase or recharge $2 once until the conquest results tally is performed. Also, you cannot purchase this item if a similar item is already in your possession.
 7813: It is possible to fully recharge $2 by trading it to one of your nation's guards, including outpost guards. One charge requires 50 conquest points.
 7814: It is possible to fully recharge $2 by trading it to one of your nation's guards, including outpost guards. One charge requires 100 conquest points.
 7815: It is possible to fully recharge $2 by trading it to one of your nation's guards, including outpost guards. One charge requires 200 conquest points.
 7816: During the time of the Great War, it was possible to have this item recharged in exchange for Allied Notes. From my understanding, that practice has recently become commonplace in the Near East. Though you'll be needing Imperial Standing credits if you wish to use the service there.
 7817: You do not possess the $1 [conquest point/conquest points] required to fully recharge the $0.
 7818: Please be aware that you can only purchase or recharge $0 once during the period between each conquest results tally.
 7819: The $0 is already fully charged.
 7820: Your $0 has received $2 [charge/charges] in exchange for $1 [conquest point/conquest points]. It is now fully recharged.
 7821: I will trade you $0 for your $1. May it serve you well.
 7822: You do not meet the requirements to purchase the $2.
 7823: Your rank is too low to purchase the $2.
 7824: You do not have enough conquest points to purchase the $2.
 7825: You cannot equip the $2. Do you still wish to proceed?
 7826: Your level is too low to equip the $2. Do you still wish to proceed?
 7827: You seem to be able to equip the $2. Do you wish to proceed?
 7828: Are you sure you want to purchase the $2?
 7829: Proceed? [Yes, purchase item./Cancel purchase.]
 7830: Proceed? [Yes, even though I can't equip it./Cancel purchase.]

 7834: Which service do you request? [Buy/Sell items./Teleportation./Nothing.]
 7835: Do you really wish to be teleported? [Yes./Teleport with gil./Teleport with conquest points./No.]
 7836: Welcome to the border shop! If you trade me unused equipment, I'll add their value to your country's region points!
 7837: It should please you to know that I now also deal in $0. Bigger pieces will earn you more points for your nation, and I'll even toss some gil into the equation!
 7838: I see that your home country has control of this region. Feel free to browse through my wares.
 7839: I see that your home country is allies with the country in control of this region. Feel free to browse through my wares.
 7840: I can teleport you to your home country for $1 gil or $3 conquest [point/points].
 7841: Word has it that the entire set of mog tablets has been recovered. Oh, happy day! In honor of the occasion, I can teleport you to your home country free of charge.
 7842: I am terribly sorry, but it seems as if you do not have enough gil.
 7843: I am terribly sorry, but it seems as if you do not have enough conquest points.
 7844: However, due to your home country's lack of influence in the region, this is the only transaction I am authorized to perform with you at the moment.
 7845: I am looking forward to doing business with you again in the future!
 7846: Thank you. This will increase your nation's region points by a small amount. If you have anything else, by all means, trade them to me.
 7847: Thank you. This will increase your nation's region points moderately. If you have anything else, by all means, trade them to me.
 7848: Thank you. This will increase your nation's region points greatly. If you have anything else, by all means, trade them to me.
 7849: I could not accept one or more items you tried to trade me. Please remove those items and try again.
 7850: Sorry. I can only take certain types of weapons, shields, or armor.
 7851: Thank you. This will increase your nation's region points [by a small amount/moderately/greatly]. For this transaction I will also furnish you with $0 gil.
 7852: My apologies, but this type of item needs to be individually appraised. Please trade them to me one at a time.
 7853: (DEBUG) Back to hometown!
 7854: What do you want? [Would you cast Signet on me?/I'd like to set my home point here./Nothing.]
 7855: What do you want? [Pay $7 gil and set my home point here./Nothing.]
 7856: Your home point has been set.
 7857: You do not have enough gil to set your home point here.
 7858: I will set your home point here.
 7859: We are currently on a beastman-purging campaign. We support adventurers from all nations. Do your best to rid the world of those vile creatures.
 7860: We are currently conducting an international exchange campaign. You may spend your conquest points to purchase items from foreign guards.
 7861: Thanks to you, our nation is now first in the conquest race! Here is a small token of our appreciation.
 7862: Adventurers from nations that are ranked higher than ours in the conquest race may purchase items from us, but at a higher rate.
 7863: You cannot currently purchase this item. Please choose another.
 7864: Currently our nation is dispatching Expeditionary Forces across Vana'diel, and requests the participation of brave adventurers such as yourself.
 7865: Requirements for participating in an E.F. are simple. Your party must consist of $5 members. Each member must be from this country, rank 3 or higher, and have reached a sufficient level.
 7866: Once your party is ready, come to me and I will teleport you to the nearest outpost.
 7867: There, you will receive an insignia of the Expeditionary Force. When you succeed in taking control of the area, you can exchange the insignia for your reward.
 7868: Join the E.F. in [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]? [Join the E.F./Not this time.]
 7869: Your party doesn't have enough members, or some of the members are not in this area. Gather all those who are participating and return here.
 7870: One of your party members is not a citizen of this country. We do not allow any foreign participants in the E.F.
 7871: One of your party members has not achieved rank level 3. We cannot reveal any of our tactical strategies to those who have not shown their loyalty to our country.
 7872: One of your party members is below level $6. For the safety of the adventurer and those accompanying him or her, we cannot allow anyone below the limit to participate in the E.F.
 7873: I see that you are ready. I grant you permission to join the current Expeditionary Force. When you are ready to teleport to the outpost, talk to me once more.
 7874: Are you ready to be teleported to [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]? Remember that party members who have not been granted permission to attend the E.F. will be left behind.
 7875: Teleport to [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]? [Ready!/Wait just a minute...]
 7876: Cancel your participation in the E.F. to [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]?
 7877: Quit the E.F.? [Yes./Change locations./No.]
 7878: Are you sure?
 7879: Really quit the E.F.? [Yes./No.]
 7880: I see. If you ever wish to participate in the future, I will be waiting here to take your application.
 7881: Your EF Badge vanishes!
 7882: Katsu-yaku pointos : $0!
 7883: This $3 is no longer valid. We will dispose of it here.
 7884: Your invalid ensignias have been disposed of.
 7885: Welcome back from the expedition. Our nation was successful in its campaign. Let me give you your reward.
 7886: You received $1 conquest points!
 7887: When participating in an Expeditionary Force, concentrate your efforts on fighting foes that give you the most experience points. And don't forget to confiscate the contents of any beastman treasure chest you happen to come upon.
 7888: I will now hand you your insignia. Be sure to read the inscription on the back before you begin your duties. Once Signet has been bestowed upon you, prepare to be teleported.
 7889: You could not be teleported. Ask me again, please.
 7890: The conquest results are currently being tallied. Come back later.
 7891: You have received permission to join the Expeditionary Forces!
 7892: Currently we rank first in Vana'diel's conquest, but that must not be taken for granted. We must continue our fight to remain on top.
 7893: We had first place in our hands, but we let it slip away. If we want to be ranked first in Vana'diel, each and every one of us must do their part. I look forward to hearing of your achievements.
 7894: Our country has fallen to third in the conquest of Vana'diel. We must step up our efforts to improve the situation.
 7895: You must fight in battles that gain high levels of experience. This is the only way we can bring areas under our country's control.
 7896: Currently, our country is the dominant force in this region. If we can maintain this level, control of this area will be ours.
 7897: Currently, our country is a major force in this region. However, we cannot take this for granted. If we let down our guard, we will surely lose control of the area!
 7898: Currently, our country has only minor influence in this region. We're counting on you to get us out of this hole we've dug ourselves into.
 7899: Currently, our country's influence in this area is minimal. If we do not act quickly, control of this region will certainly be taken by a rival country.
 7900: Take care when passing through, as this area is currently overrun with beastmen! Something must be done, or the enemy will have control of the entire region.
 7901: Your inventory is full. You could not accept the $0.
 7902: You already possess a gate glyph. You cannot hold any more.
 7903: I am Jeunoan Ducal Guard, %. My duty is to support the conquest efforts of Windurst, San d'Oria, and Bastok.

 8093: PAUSE
 8094: $1
 8095: Delivering goods to residences everywhere!
 8096: The minstrel of melodies is my name, For a mere $6 gil I'll recall your past. Your stories of love, anger, triumph, and shame, The river of memories runs deep and vast.
 8097: The minstrel of melodies is my name, For a mere $6 gil I'd recall your past. But I find that you're lacking in cash or in fame, So until that time, my kind offer will last.
 8098: Now close your eyes...
 8099: Good day, young adventurer. Would you mind having a spot of tea with an old woman? I could use some company.
 8100: You see this small chest? It was given to me by my late husband, Goddess bless his soul.
 8101: But look at it. It is fairly old, the craftsmanship is not that remarkable, and on top of that, it is locked. Not the kind of gift you would think of giving a loved one, eh? Heh heh heh...
 8102: This is the only present I ever got from my husband. I can still remember the day he gave it to me... "Here." That is all he said... He never was good with words.
 8103: But I still treasure this chest with my life... You must think I am crazy to hold on to something so useless for so long.
 8104: Excusey-woozy me. Is anybody-buddy home?
 8105: Oh, and who might you be, my little friend?
 8106: My name is Kurou-Morou the Magnificentaru. I am the proprietor of the most reliable-viable astrological services in all of Jeuno.
 8107: I came here today to ask a favor. I was wondering if you would be willing to part with that chestaru.
 8108: What?
 8109: I've heard rumors from my customers that a strange-wangey oldy-moldy chest is in your possession. I sense that the chest you hold may be magical.
 8110: There is a legend that states how once, long ago, a shy, timid god constructed a box to help him convey-away his true feelings to his love. He filled the box with the words he could not speak, and sent it to her.
 8111: You are saying that this box is...
 8112: You did not know?
 8113: You can open that chestaru using $6, which are said to fall to Vana'diel from the moon.
 8114: Once open, the promise of true love will be fulfilled...or so says the legend.
 8115: I need that chestaru to tell Chulu...to tell my longtime friend how I feely-wheely about her. I want to fill it with my feelings.
 8116: Why don't you just tell her yourself?
 8117: I...I can'taru!
 8118: And you mean to tell me...you've never opened the chestaru?
 8119: That is correct. It was a gift from my husband...
 8120: He...he would not have believed in such fairy tales...or would he...?
 8121: Well, I can'taru use that chestaru if it is filled all chock-full of someone else's feelings... But if we had $6 from the Boyahda Tree, we could open it and...
 8122: I apologize for asking so much of you, but could you find it in your heart to travel to the Boyahda Tree and find us $6?
 8123: Please, [Sir/Ma'am]! When we can open that chestaru, a miracle surely-wurley awaits!
 8124: Travel to the Boyahda Tree? [Yes./No.]
 8125: What a kind young [lad/lady] you are. I appreciate that you would take on such a dangerous task for a feeble old woman.
 8126: But to think that my husband would leave me such a gift...
 8127: Oh well, I guess it was too much to ask of you...
 8128: Ah, <Player>. You have come back. I know that it is asking a lot, but could you find it in your heart to assist me in finding the $3 that Kurou-Morou spoke of?
 8129: According to our little friend, there is a place deep within the Boyahda Tree where the moonlight penetrates the leaves. Once you have arrived at that spot, offering a prayer to the gods is the only way to obtain $6.
 8130: You've returned! So this is $6... It's so clear and beautiful...but will it really open my husband's chest?
 8131: Oh, I see you've returned with $6! So, have there been any miracles yetaru?
 8132: The box opened...but nothing has happened so far...
 8133: Nothing has happened? Nothing has happened!? But the legend said...
 8134: The legend was just a legend. Maybe we were foolish to believe...
 8135: So there was nothing in the box?
 8136: ...? What is this? It looks like a note. Wait, this is my husband's handwriting!
 8137: My dear Ilumida, I don't know why I am writing this. You know I have never been good at telling you how I feel.
 8138: Many a time I have tried to put into words my love for you, but those words never seemed to make their way out.
 8139: Drinking tea together on an autumn morning, or resting in the shade on a summer afternoon...it was the little things that brought me happiness.
 8140: As much as I would like to throw away everything and spend all my time with you, the situation in Vana'diel now will not let me.
 8141: I wish that I could be by your side when you read this letter, but that may not be what destiny has in store for me. I must tell you how I feel now.
 8142: I love you.
 8143: To this day I regret never saying these words to you, and I beg that one day you will forgive me. Adaruel
 8144: The date... This is dated the day before he went off to the war...
 8145: All that time, he just wanted to say...
 8146: My little friend. I think I can understand what you are going through.
 8147: Here. Take this chest.
 8148: R-really?
 8149: Of course. I no longer require it. I have already received its true gift.
 8150: If you truly care about this girl, avoid doing things that you will regret later. Women do not care about how fancy the delivery is. If you really mean what you say, she'll know it.
 8151: Whether you use that box or not is for you to decide.
 8152: Th...thank you. But I think I won't be needing it.
 8153: Your story has given me the courage to tell Chululu how I feel. Thank you, Ma'am.
 8154: Oh, <Player>. Take this--and some gil--as a reward. I was going to use them to acquire the chest anyway-away. Well, I'm off to my shop. Ta-taru!
 8155: Thank you again for all of your help. Those words my husband left me still echo in my mind... It is as if he were here in this room, standing with me now...
 8156: Our little friend was able to express his feelings to his girlfriend? I knew that he would do the right thing.
 8157: I would like to sit down and have a cup of tea with that Chululu. I'm sure we would have a great deal to chat about...
 8158: Wow, where did you get all those calluses on your hands?
 8159: From practicing with your axe?
 8160: That's pretty impressive, but I still don't think you could match my boss over there. He rounded up our chocobos and built this whole stable, all with a single axe.
 8161: Why, he could take out the deadliest of monsters with a single swipe!
 8162: Osker! Stop your gabbing and get back to work! Our chocobos are starving over there!
 8163: I-I'm sorry, boss. I was just admiring this adventurer's hands. They look like they could wield an axe real good.
 8164: Look. They've got calluses all over them, just like yours!
 8165: You know, you're right... <Player>, it looks like you know your axe pretty well. If it isn't too much trouble, I'd like to ask you a favor.
 8166: The other day, the leader of that Tenshodo outfit paid us an unexpected visit...
 8167: He said he was interested in going into the axe business, but wasn't sure about which one he wanted to sell in his shop. He asked me to test two new models...but I'm busy enough with the stables and don't have any extra time to go out slicing and dicing.
 8168: If you're not too busy, would you mind trying one out? You can think of it as polishing your skills.
 8169: How about it? [Okay, I'll help you out./I'm sorry...]
 8170: That's great! Here, take her. I already got somebody to try out the other one.
 8171: Now go out and test that girl until she's as blunt as a chocobo girl. When you feel the axe has sliced her last slice, bring her back to me and we'll continue from there. Got it?
 8172: Yeah, you look like a busy [man/lady]. Can't expect somebody to help you out when there's nothing in it for them...
 8173: When you feel the axe has sliced her last slice, show her to me, and I'll decide if we're to continue or not. Or are you here on other business?
 8174: What do you want? [I've lost the $1./I'm tired of testing the axe./Nothing at all.]
 8175: You've what? Oh well, the Tenshodo guy gave me a box full of these axes, so I could care less if you used 'em to shave your cat's whiskers.
 8176: Here, take another one. But you know this means that you're going to have to start all over now, right?
 8177: Don't tell me that you're throwing in the towel? C'mon now. I've got a lot of work to do, and there aren't many kind folk out there that would help an old cowboy like me.
 8178: Really throw in the towel? [Yes./No.]
 8179: I knew you'd come through for me, <Player>. Now get out there and get chopping! Take your time if you're busy with your other adventuring.
 8180: Boy, you young folk these days have no respect. You give somebody your word, and then you go back on it like it don't mean nothing at all.
 8181: I guess I'll just have to find somebody else to help me out. Now take that axe of yours and skedaddle.
 8182: I don't know... I don't think I can decide yet. Whack up a few more monsters and then bring her back here for another look.
 8183: Well, I'll be! You've worked this axe so hard that I could whack Osker over the head with it and he wouldn't even get a scratch. Now I think I'll be able to decide on which axe I recommend to the Tenshodo.
 8184: To tell you the truth, <Player>, I didn't think you'd be able to handle the test. I'm really impressed. To show my true gratification, how'd you like to put your axe-wielding skills to a real test?
 8185: Back when I was still a blazin' young'un, me and my partners used to compete over who was the strongest of our pack. There was no real meaning to it, but it was fun and helped us build up our confidence on the battlefield.
 8186: And after a few of those sessions, I could feel my skills getting more and more refined, until I was smashing through anything that got in my path.
 8187: Here, take this $3 and head to the Temple of Uggalepih. Once you're there, all you have to do is find $6. Bring it back to me, and you're done. Sounds easy, but you'd better go well prepared. I've seen more than a few buddies get their hides tanned by the beast that lives in that place.
 8188: Take that $3 and head to the Temple of Uggalepih. Once you're there, find $6 and bring it back to me...but be careful now, hear?
 8189: Ha hah! You dog, you! I can tell by the grin on your face that you kicked that monster in the be-hind!
 8190: But enough with the small talk! Let's take a look at that there $3.
 8191: Whoa! I wish I could be as strong as you and my boss someday! No, someday I will be as strong as you. You just wait and see!
 8192: ...I take my hat off to you, <Player>.
 8193: As long as there are hard-hittin' white knuckled [men/ladies] like you out there, Vana'diel won't have to worry about no beastmen or no Shadow Lords.
 8194: Now it's time to get back to work. Osker! Stop your dilly-dallying!
 8195: More work? I'll never get a chance to practice my axe!
 8196: Oh, quit your whining. One of my acquaintances should be here any minute.
 8197: Acquaintance? Wow, I didn't think you had any friends, boss.
 8198: You just shut your trap, Osker, or I'll glue it shut!
 8199: Hello there, Brutus. I've brought back the axe you had me testing. It's a fine piece of work, but the head's a little too heavy for my taste.
 8200: Anyway, Brutus, do you remember what day it is today?
 8201: What day it is? Of course I do! One look on the calendar over there and...
 8202: Don't tell me you forgot that today was the day you'd let me ride my old chocobo?
 8203: Ha ha ha! I had you going there for a while, didn't I? Of course I remember. You did a good job with that girl. All the folks over here at the stables rave about how she's been the easiest to work with.
 8204: The adventurers do, too! They say she's the most obedient chocobo they've ever ridden.
 8205: Heh heh. They didn't say that, did they?
 8206: Would I lie to you? You've become one helluva beastmaster, if you ask me.
 8207: Her wounds are still not fully healed, but I don't think that a quick ride around the Duchy would hurt. Go on!
 8208: Thanks again, Brutus.
 8209: But you know...I'm still worried that she won't trust me riding her yet...you know, after all that I put her through...
 8210: Are you still fretting over that? Come on, take a look at her eyes.
 8211: They're shining as bright as yours, Dietmund.
 8212: Brutus...
 8213: Hey, hey! You're not going get all sissy on me now, are you!?
 8214: I-I-I don't know what t-to say. I think I've g-got something in me eye...
 8215: If all you're going to do is stand there and cry, the get the hell out of my stables! You're scaring away business!
 8216: Th-thank you, Brutus...
 8217: No, thank you, everyone. I'll never forget this day...never...
 8218: You have learned the weapon skill "Decimation"!
 8219: See, Dietmund came back, just like I told you. I could tell it from his eyes. People ain't that different from chocobos, you know. You can always tell what they're thinking by taking a gander at their baby blues, or blacks, or whatever color they may be.
 8220: It won't be long before this girl goes home to her master... But you won't see me crying! Mr. Dietmund promised me that I could ride her whenever I wanted!
 8221: The chocobo looks extremely happy.
 8222: How is he doing?
 8223: Well, there don't seem to be any external wounds. To tell you the truth, I don't exactly know what is wrong with him.
 8224: You don't exactly know? So you have some sort of theory?
 8225: ... I'm sorry, but I'm not inclined to speak of a patient's condition. Not even to the captain of the Ducal Guard.
 8226: As you wish. But that boy is an important witness. When he comes to, he will be taken in for questioning. Has he shown any signs of consciousness?
 8227: I'm afraid not...
 8228: Wolfgang, what really happened back in that room? What was that device, and what were Jeuno's scientists trying to do with it? You know something, don't you?
 8229: You need not worry yourself with the affairs of the Duchy.
 8230: I see... I suppose some things are better left unknown. I often ponder over whether to inform a patient when their disease is incurable. However, if there still remains even a thread of hope to cure that disease...
 8231: If you are trying to say that Jeuno is ill, you are quite mistaken.
 8232: <Sigh> Let me rephrase my question.
 8233: Friend to friend, what simply happened that day?
 8234: I... I truly do not know. That is why it is crucial we question that boy.
 8235: If there is nothing wrong with him, then there is no reason why we cannot move him to the Grand Duke Palace immediately. Monberaux, make the preparations for his transport.
 8236: Ah, it's you... As much as I'd like to sit and chat about your adventures over a nice pot of San d'Orian tea, now is not quite the time.
 8237: Wait. Perhaps you know something of what took place near the Sea of Shu'Meyo. Recently I have been hearing some strange rumors...
 8238: Doctor Monberaux, there is much commotion outside the infirmary. Do you think the Ducal Guards have returned?
 8239: Those selfish bastards! Do they think of nothing but their own gain?
 8240: I apologize, but there is something I must first take care of.
 8241: And we cannot get any answers without the boy awake and in custody! Hand him over! That is an order!
 8242: You can order me all you wish, but I will not allow you to wake that boy!
 8243: Men, you have your orders.
 8244: Wait, Wolfgang! What are you planning on doing to him!? I won't allow you to manhandle my patients like this!
 8245: What is going on!? ...!?
 8246: He... He just vanished!
 8247: Don't just stand there! Seal off the area! I don't want any man, woman, dog, or cat leaving Upper Jeuno. That boy can't hide for long.
 8248: I've seen that child somewhere before...
 8249: I don't understand. No signs of consciousness for hours, and then he just wakes up and runs off... There must be an explanation for this...
 8250: I'm sorry you had to witness that exchange. I'd like to better inform you of what just happened, but even I'm puzzled by the events that have transpired today.
 8251: Are you all right? You look slightly pale.
 8252: Well, I hope it is nothing serious.
 8253: That amulet you hold. It belongs to the boy, does it not? What's this? You say he gave it to you?
 8254: I suggest that you hold on to it. It may give us some clues as to what is really going on. It also may...
 8255: ...Never mind.
 8256: Perhaps I should begin my rounds in the Ru'Lude Gardens. I may be able to collect some valuable information. I've a feeling the situation up there may be even tenser than it is here...
 8257: From a medical standpoint, it's a miracle the boy woke up at all. I cannot explain it...
 8258: Why does Wolfgang need to speak with him so desperately?
 8259: Perhaps you should visit the Ru'Lude Gardens. I've a feeling the situation up there may be even tenser than it is here.
 8260: An acquaintance of the patient who was just brought in?
 8261: That is correct. Where is she!?
 8262: Ah, you also know the patient? You may accompany <Player>.
 8263: However, I must warn you. Her condition is still quite unstable. It seems she is suffering terribly...
 8264: Prishe!
 8265: Wait, you are...
 8266: Do you two know each other? This noble warrior is the one who brought in our unconscious princess.
 8267: Sir Tenzen...the adventurer, <Player>, also seems to be acquainted with the patient.
 8268: Prishe... What ill fate has befallen you...?
 8269: ...Keeper...
 8270: Prishe?
 8271: ...of the...Apocalypse...
 8272: Keeper of the Apocalypse? Of what are you speaking?
 8273: !?
 8274: Calling...me... ...Stop! ...Get away!
 8275: N-no...!
 8276: Her amulet! It is gone!
 8277: You! Did you not see an amulet about my dear friend's neck? Without it, she...
 8278: I apologize, miss, but by the time I had found her, she was without this amulet of which you speak.
 8279: Impossible...
 8280: Wait! <Player>, would you show me your amulet?
 8281: I feel that the two may be connected in some way. Please! It may be the only way we can save Prishe!
 8282: The patient's condition has stabilized. However, she shows no signs of awakening from the deep sleep into which she has fallen. In all my years as a doctor, I have never seen anything like this...
 8283: <Player>, do you truly feel that this all has some connection to that amulet?
 8284: If only the mysterious boy who dropped it were still here, he might help us shed some light onto the predicament in which we find ourselves...
 8285: Boy...? You do not mean the same boy whom the Ducal Guard is searching for, do you?
 8286: What is this? Have you also heard the rumors of the strange young man who disappeared days ago?
 8287: While visiting the palace, I was told of a certain dangerous boy.
 8288: I see... So this boy carried with him an amulet similar to that of the girl. This could be why she was attacked...
 8289: But, Prishe's amulet was given to her by Cardinal Mildaurion. It is preposterous to think that the cardinal could be associated with any criminals!
 8290: Cardinal Mildaurion of the Tavnazian Cathedral?
 8291: Yes. Long ago, the cardinal gave the amulet to Prishe after she had been badly injured in an accident. She said it was to protect her.
 8292: Ever since that day, she has not been without the amulet. But why would anyone wish to steal it...?
 8293: Perhaps it was the boy who stole the patient's amulet. However, just days ago I heard that the boy was recently spotted in the ruins of Pso'Xja, located deep within the dreaded Northlands.
 8294: What!? Are you positive!?
 8295: A soldier I treated for hypothermia mentioned that his party had seen him alone in the ruins. When the Ducal Guard learned of this, they set out for the Northlands at once.
 8296: So the fourth crystal lies in the ruins of Pso'Xja... I have no time to lose.
 8297: Wait!
 8298: Before you set off on your journey, I must inform you that the ruins are controlled by an organization known as the Tenshodo. You should probably consult with them first.
 8299: I see... Thank you for this information. Good day, Doctor!
 8300: I wonder if there might be some connection between the boy and that young lady, Prishe.
 8301: According to the rumors among the Ducal Guard, someone saw him in the central tower of the northern ruins of Pso'Xja. However, to enter the deeper parts of those towers, permission from Tenshodo is necessary...
 8302: You say you know the Elvaan girl who collapsed here?
 8303: A strangely-dressed traveler from the East carried her off to Doctor Monberaux's clinic. Oh, I do hope she is alright.
 8304: Unlike the unsavory rumors that have been spreading through the Duchy streets, the Elvaan girl who collapsed here was not attacked by some shady assailant.
 8305: While she was kneeling before the statue of the Goddess to offer a prayer, she suddenly crumpled to the floor and began convulsing violently. I attempted to cleanse her soul of the terrible demons that possessed her; however, my holy water had no effect.
 8306: I can only hope my prayers for her safety reach the Goddess swiftly.
 8307: ... I-I apologize. I have not been myself since the Elvaan girl had her...accident.
 8308: I know that Mother Chiphraix insists that no foul play was involved, but I could swear that I sensed a dark presence behind the girl before she collapsed.
 8309: And now every time I think of it, I become light-headed and dizzy...
 8310: If you're here to see the girl, she's been awake for the past few hours.
 8311: What do you think you're talking about!? There's no way that the cardinal would...
 8312: I know, but even if she did, I am positive there is a reasonable explanation.
 8313: Oh, <Player>. I cannot begin to express my gratitude for you saving Prishe.
 8314: She has informed me of what transpired that day.
 8315: Possessed by an unknown beast within her own dream...
 8316: You and Tenzen were able to bring her back. However, we still do not know what has become of the amulet she carried.
 8317: I sense that the goings-on of the past few days are but the tip of the iceberg.
 8318: <Player>, is there anything more you can tell us?
 8319: That is the question we should be asking you!
 8320: What are your connections with this criminal that I, the Duchy, and <Player> are searching for?
 8321: The boy who has constantly eluded the Ducal Guard--where is he hiding?
 8322: Prishe, you must answer me. Why was that boy with you, and where has he disappeared to!?
 8323: Hell if I know... But there is one thing that I can say: I don't care if he's on the top of Jeuno's most wanted list. If it weren't for him saving my butt, I'd be pushing up lilacs in the necropolis.
 8324: Anyway, it's not the boy I'm worried about. What are you going to do about that monster in my dream!? You said you knew what it was, right?
 8325: Come on! Spill it, old man! Why is that thing after me!?
 8326: Diabolos... Terrestrial avatar of dreams...
 8327: Terrestrial avatar...?
 8328: The terrestrial avatars are the five powerful gods born of Vana'diel and entrusted to protect her.
 8329: Many eons ago, the five avatars fought a fierce battle with an evil presence that attempted to envelop and suffocate our world.
 8330: There is the fiery bird of resurrection, Phoenix, whom the blade I carry at my side has been blessed by.
 8331: And then there is the ruler of dreams, Diabolos; the guardian of the moon, Fenrir; the bringer of rainbows, Carbuncle; and the conqueror of the skies, Bahamut...
 8332: Ba-Bahamut!?
 8333: You have heard of the legend of Bahamut? It just so happens that I have traveled across many malms of ocean to this continent in order to meet Bahamut--and request his assistance in stopping the Keeper of the Apocalypse.
 8334: !!!
 8335: Now that you mention it, when I went to Cape Riverne, I do remember Bahamut saying something about a keeper of some sorts...
 8336: Keeper of the Apocalypse... Prishe! Those are the words you spoke while you were unconscious!
 8337: All I remember is that before you guys arrived, that monster Diabolos talked about a song that sang of the keeper. What was it called...? "Memoria de la S^tona"?
 8338: The memory of the crystal...
 8339: He also said that when the keeper arrives, "our pact will be fulfilled." Whatever that means...
 8340: And that's why he told me to see Bahamut as soon as possible...
 8341: "Our pact"... What could he have meant...?
 8342: Beats me, and I don't plan on going back there to ask him.
 8343: But I have a feeling that Bahamut could fill us in on the details. That's why we've got to get back to Tavnazia!
 8344: Back to Tavnazia? You mean to tell me that you have come from the Marquisate?
 8345: That is correct. However, we were teleported here by Bahamut when we tried to speak with him...
 8346: What an excellent turn of events!
 8347: It just so happens that I have requested transport to Tavnazia from the leader of the Tenshodo, Aldo. If it is possible, I would like you two to join me and help me find Bahamut!
 8348: So you're the guy Aldo was talking about...
 8349: Well, I guess the more the merrier, right? We'll meet you at the Tenshodo when you're ready to go.
 8350: Understood!
 8351: Oh, and you, <Player>.
 8352: I'll be holding on to this amulet for just a little while longer. You got a problem with that?
 8353: Hey, and when you're finished with your business here, why don't you come back to Tavnazia? You know the way, right?
 8354: See ya around!
 8355: You lend the $3 to Prishe.
 8356: I'm delighted to see my young patient fully recovered. She's awfully energetic when conscious, isn't she?
 8357: It appears our visitors have returned to Tavnazia. I admit being most surprised to hear the nation still existed.
 8358: <Player>, it seems as if you have experienced a trying ordeal in the Northlands.
 8359: I have attempted to gather information from the Ducal Guard; however, none are willing--or should I say allowed--to speak of the matter, though the fear in their eyes tells much.
 8360: And that is not all... Recently there have been unsettling rumors that the end of the world is near.
 8361: Those rumors also say that the young patient that I treated--the girl who had her amulet stolen--is connected with all this in some matter.
 8362: I have even heard that the Ducal Guard has a warrant out for her arrest...
 8363: Preposterous! Lady Prishe is simply being used. The true criminal is that boy!
 8364: Why, if it is not...
 8365: I apologize for my sudden entrance, Doctor.
 8366: <Player>! Something terrible is underway!
 8367: I have come from the Grand Duke Palace, where I heard of the Duchy's ridiculous plan. Jeuno has begun to mobilize the Ducal Guard in preparation for an attack on...Bahamut!
 8368: Yes, Bahamut has threatened Vana'diel with the promise of apocalypse. However, he is still one of the terrestrial avatars bound to protect our world.
 8369: There must be some way to persuade the conqueror of the skies...and that is why I requested to accompany the commander of this operation, Lady Esha'ntarl. Unfortunately...
 8370: ...the commander was not one to listen to reason. She is convinced that it would be futile to try and communicate with Bahamut, and the only way to save the people of Vana'diel is to attack the Wyrmking and his minions before they attack our cities.
 8371: Excuse me, sir. I am not sure if I fully comprehend what you are trying to say.
 8372: Bahamut is readying to launch an attack on the four nations? That cannot be true!
 8373: But if it was...
 8374: Have the leaders of the nations been informed? Have their armies begun preparations?
 8375: Unfortunately, San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst more than likely remain oblivious to the situation at hand. And even if they did know, they would have no means of mounting a counterattack.
 8376: Bahamut is known as the conqueror of the skies for a reason. The power he and his minions possess is beyond anything we could imagine--the power to control time and space.
 8377: Control time and space...?
 8378: The moment he and his minions were to arrive above our cities would be the moment of our defeat. We would have no choice but to accept annihilation...
 8379: ...
 8380: But I feel there is still a way...
 8381: Lady Esha'ntarl mentioned that Bahamut is currently building up the energy necessary for teleporting his fellow wyrms to the locations of attack.
 8382: If we could reach Bahamut before he has stored enough power, we may be able to persuade him not to begin his ambush of Vana'diel.
 8383: Persuade him? The end of the world is right before us, and you want to sit down and chat with the bringer of that destruction!?
 8384: Exactly! With the Phoenix Blade and <Player> by my side, I am positive that I can convince Bahamut to spare the lives of those on this world.
 8385: But to succeed, I require your assistance, Doctor.
 8386: I need to know where that boy was first discovered!
 8387: ...!
 8388: ... Understood. Wolfgang, captain of the Ducal Guard, ordered me not to reveal this information to anyone...however, I am afraid I no longer have any choice.
 8389: On the first floor of Delkfutt's Tower, there is a large doorway that leads into the deeper areas of the spire.
 8390: It is somewhere down there that the boy mysteriously appeared. A large, central chamber...but that is all I remember.
 8391: I am extremely grateful for all you have done for us, Doctor. Come, <Player>, we have no time to lose.
 8392: Ah, but there is a door--a locked door, and only Wolfgang knows how to open it.
 8393: I have no worries, as Phoenix will lead the way.
 8394: <Player>, make your preparations quickly and meet me at the tower.
 8395: <Player>, it may be a worthless effort, but let me ask Wolfgang for the key to that chamber.
 8396: While sometimes misled, he is a man who strongly believes in justice. He may feel that it is solely his duty to protect the world on the eve of its destruction.
 8397: We must let him know that there are those of us who also follow the same path as he. Here. Take this envelope to the palace guard post. I will be praying for your success, <Player>.
 8398: The boy first appeared in Delkfutt's Tower. On the first floor of the tower, there is a large doorway that leads into the deeper areas of the structure...
 8399: Wolfgang will know how to open the door that lies beyond. Take this envelope to the palace guard post. I will be praying for your success, <Player>.
 8400: I see by his reaction that Wolfgang understood the meaning of the map.
 8401: Where should you go? Hah hah. That's a secret, <Player>. Though, if you think hard enough, I feel you will come to understand.
 8402: I knew all along Wolfgang would come. He is a good man, despite being a little stubborn. Now hurry to Delkfutt's Tower. Tenzen should already be on his way.
 8403: Somewhere on the first floor there is a large doorway that leads to the basement of the tower. The key you received from Wolfgang will open that door.
 8404: Wolfgang should not be giving you any more problems. I think he has finally started to realize what is truly important in this world.
 8405: Have you heard the rumors? Some are saying that the end of the world is upon us.
 8406: Thanks to that, we here at the clinic have lately been spending more time mending people's spirits than their broken bones.
 8407: <Player>, it is good to see you.
 8408: We have finally grasped the entire tapestry that our separate tales have woven.
 8409: I never believed that something like this was possible.
 8410: I suggest you prepare yourself before Lady Ulmia arrives.
 8411: Why is everyone so quiet? Is something wrong?
 8412: Lady Ulmia, we have been waiting for you. Will you steel your heart and listen to the story we have to tell?
 8413: Of course, we have tried to refute this conclusion and find some other explanation.
 8414: However, we now know that the boy, Selh'teus, has come to thwart the plans of the ancient ones and steal the light of the crystals.
 8415: We also know that the Divinity of Darkness that rules over the Kindred was not Promathia after all.
 8416: But...the Moblins...heard from...the Divinity of Darkness...that the...Keeper of the Apocalypse...has already...arisen.
 8417: And surely you have seen the magicite imbedded in Prishe's chest?
 8418: According to your explanation, that stone contained the Emptiness of the Twilight God, Promathia.
 8419: Lady Ulmia. This must come as a shock for one so close to Lady Prishe.
 8420: But I must inform you of the facts I have learned from the terrestrial avatars Carbuncle and Fenrir.
 8421: After ten thousand years, the Keeper of the Apocalypse was fated to be born in the nation of Tavnazia!
 8422: Surely you are not saying that this keeper you speak of is Prishe!
 8423: That is impossible! I refuse to believe it!
 8424: We have been friends since the time before Tavnazia's destruction!
 8425: I can honestly say that I have never met a person more pure of heart.
 8426: She has more faith, and more courage...
 8427: How could she be the Keeper of the Apocalypse and still urge Diabolos to save the world?
 8428: It is true that I do not know of anyone who possesses the zest for life that Prishe has.
 8429: And if we had but the time and the knowledge, we would rescue Lady Prishe from this destiny.
 8430: However, we have no time remaining.
 8431: A duty lies before us: Lord Bahamut and his minions must be stopped!
 8432: And if Cardinal Mildaurion is still alive as we believe, she will be planning to use Prishe to awaken the Twilight God.
 8433: With Prishe and her magicite in the cardinal's possession, the world is one step away from oblivion!
 8434: When Promathia...awakens...there will be...no stopping...the Moblins.
 8435: Stop it, all of you. You truly intend to do away with Prishe if it means the plans of Wyrmking Bahamut will be prevented?
 8436: That is something I cannot do!
 8437: Lady Ulmia!
 8438: ...
 8439: Let her be. The first thing we have to do is rrrescue Prishe from the Grand Duke Palace. I'll start working on a plan.
 8440: I will call upon some old acquaintances. They may be able to help us.
 8441: I wish...no more lives...to be lost. I...will do...what I can.
 8442: <Player>.
 8443: Do you agree with our decision?
 8444: Do you agree? [No, I don't./There's no other way./What decision?]
 8445: Do not let our actions concern you.
 8446: You are free to follow your own path from here.
 8447: I only ask that you look after Lady Ulmia. She did not take this news well.
 8448: There is little you can say to comfort her, but at least see her safely to Tavnazia.
 8449: If you ask the aid of Lady Esha'ntarl, I am sure your return will be a swift one.
 8450: Until we meet again!
 8451: You understand what we have all agreed to here? We have come to a brutal and bloody conclusion.
 8452: Although no one life holds more importance than another, I have a duty to save the world, no matter the cost.
 8453: But still... I worry for Lady Ulmia.
 8454: In order to save the world from destruction, we must defeat the one known as the Keeper of the Apocalypse.
 8455: Even if Lady Prishe herself is the Keeper, I will not fail to carry out this task.
 8456: A beautiful lady justaru ran that way, tears streaming down her face. I've never seen anything like it.
 8457: Today is Tarutaru day at the pub, and she was an Elvaan. I can understand how that'd make you want to cry.
 8458: I am glad to see that you have all survived unscathed.
 8459: You...!
 8460: You are...the priest...!?
 8461: Nice to see you both again after so long.
 8462: It's been twenty years since I've seen you, Shikaree Z. And a hundred years for you, Jabbos, if I'm not mistaken.
 8463: And you, the man of extraordinary luck.
 8464: I am most delighted to be in your presence once more, Cardinal Mildaurion.
 8465: I would love to celebrate this long overdue reunion; however, now is not the time.
 8466: Lord Bahamut has revealed to us an unsettling truth--the Keeper of the Apocalypse waits in the celestial capital of Al'Taieu.
 8467: Until now, the Armathrwn Society had believed the city of Al'Taieu destroyed.
 8468: Judging by the counsel of the terrestrial avatars and the memories of Selh'teus, however, we can assume that the celestial capital still exists.
 8469: The society is now focused on gaining further information. To this end, the objective of our next operation is to capture--not kill--Lord Bahamut.
 8470: I, Esha'ntarl, will join the main fleet of warships and head once more to the ends of the earth.
 8471: But there is another important matter that requires our immediate attention--a matter involving the fifth mothercrystal.
 8472: Someone has apparently severed the fifth crystal from the Crystal Line.
 8473: When the boy, Selh'teus, appeared, was not this Crystal Line the conduit he traversed with Lord Bahamut?
 8474: Just a damn moment! So now we can't use this pipeline gizmo to get to the fifth mothercrystal!?
 8475: How are we supposed to get to Al'Taieu and wipe the floor with the Keeper of the Apocalypse!?
 8476: How, indeed. In any event, we must search for an alternative route now that Phoenix is no longer with us.
 8477: Wait. Mildaurion, you mentioned that "someone" isolated the fifth mothercrystal?
 8478: Who is rrresponsible for this act of sabotage?
 8479: I do not know. The only people capable of such a feat would be either Selh'teus, or Nag'molada...
 8480: I currently have Jeunoan troops preparing to invade Movalpolos.
 8481: M...Movalpolos...!?
 8482: The Moblins...are in danger...!? I must...leave...immediately!
 8483: Jabbos has spent a century living with the Moblins in an effort to avert this sort of development.
 8484: This is most worrisome. I shall follow him and see he does not come to harm.
 8485: I will accompany you!
 8486: I realize that Jabbos has tried for years to convince the Moblins that they are not the children of Promathia.
 8487: But for the sake of the mothercrystal, the Moblins cannot be left to their own devices.
 8488: If he fails to persuade them otherwise, they may attempt to destroy the fifth crystal.
 8489: Destroy the crystal!?
 8490: The mothercrystal is at both the beginning and the end of a person's journey in this life.
 8491: After learning this fact from Jabbos, the Moblins now believe that destroying the mothercrystal will spell the end for the children of Altana.
 8492: How could Jabbos fail to mention something so important!?
 8493: He had no choice. If that kinda thing became public knowledge, Movalpolos would be gutted and all the Moblins slaughtered.
 8494: !
 8495: Miss Mildaurion. I'm not in a position to be giving advice to a ten thousand-year-old, but just hear me out.
 8496: Killing every last Moblin might make this mess all nice and neat, but it's not what I'd call a solution.
 8497: Isn't this the exact same thing that Bahamut is trying to do?
 8498: ...
 8499: You are right... Nothing good can come of this...
 8500: I will plead with the Armathrwn Society to find a peaceable solution to this problem.
 8501: Thanks, Miss Mildaurion!
 8502: But from this point onward I will be joining the society to monitor its actions.
 8503: My movements will be limited, but rest assured that I will be watching over you always. Now go, my brave companions. The fate of the world and her people is in your hands.
 8504: Alrighty! Ulmia, Tenzen, <Player>! On to Movalpolos!
 8505: Everyone who wants to scrap it out for the ultimate victory, follow me!!!
 8506: I hear this pub is sometimes reserved by the head of the Tenshodo.
 8507: Not a momentaru ago, there were Mithra and Galka and all sorts filing out the door. They were saying something about going to Movalpolos.
 8508: Are they thinking of bringing their beastmen buddies back here? Next thing you know, they'll be having "Goblin's Day."
 8509: You must indeed be serious about your beliefs to choose the Temple of the Goddess over the bustling sights and sounds of Jeuno.
 8510: In my long years I have come to discover that a person serious about [his/her] beliefs is a person who can be trusted with a serious task.
 8511: Are you willing to hear my request?
 8512: Listen to his request? [I'll listen./I come here for the peace and quiet.]
 8513: Thank you, adventurer. Perhaps you have heard of the ruins of Pso'Xja, that are found on the Beaucedine Glacier?
 8514: It is whispered that those ruins are deeply entwined with the history of the ancients.
 8515: When thieves discovered the mysterious structures in later years, they were quick to put up iron grates at the tower entrances and carry away the relics within.
 8516: However, they were never able to open the decorated gate that lies in the deepest part of the ruins. The thieves searched for a way to open this portal for many years.
 8517: Only recently did they finally stumble across the key to the gate. What they found inside apparently did not live up to their expectations.
 8518: Believing that they had claimed all the treasures to be found, the Tenshodo opened almost every area of the six towers to adventurers.
 8519: I do not agree with the Tenshodo's appraisal of their final discovery. The magical device that was hidden behind that gate closely resembles those that exist in the towers of Sarutabaruta.
 8520: Would this not mean that the towers of Pso'Xja have a similar function to the Sarutabaruta ruins?
 8521: I have had adventurers who share your level of integrity delve into the ruins several times to investigate this possibility.
 8522: I do not think the Tenshodo has given the matter due consideration. A magical device was found on the other side of that gate.
 8523: No one knows the purpose behind the towers' construction, and it is far too dangerous to allow the general population access to the ruins without further research.
 8524: And that is why I decided to ask adventurers who share your level of integrity to place a seal upon that gate.
 8525: The only problem is, not one adventurer has been able to reach it. There are two other gates that block the path to the deepest section of the southwest tower.
 8526: Will you attempt to find a way into the southwest tower's heart?
 8527: Will you go? [I will./I don't think so.]
 8528: You will be able to open the final gate with this $3. It should also activate the magical device that lies beyond.
 8529: Once the device is activated, return here for your reward. I pray for your success.
 8530: Seal the final gate using this $3. I pray for your success.
 8531: Find a way into the deepest section of the southwest tower, and activate the device that lies beyond the final gate. Both the gate and the device should respond to the $3.
 8532: Find a way into the deepest section of the southwest tower, and seal the final gate with the $3. I pray for your success.
 8533: That was too close... Thankfully, the device was activated before those meddling scholars from Windurst arrived.
 8534: But my work is not done. I must find a way to seal the device so that no one can stop it...
 8535: You have my thanks. It appears the obstructions within the tower did not prevent you from activating the device.
 8536: The devices within the other towers are also being activated, one by one. Please accept your reward.
 8537: You have my thanks. It appears the obstructions within the tower did not prevent you from sealing the gate.
 8538: Do not be concerned; the gates within the other towers are being sealed as we speak. Please accept your reward.
 8539: Ah, the gate did not open for you? That is because a more experienced adventurer activated the device before you arrived.
 8540: However, I still wish to recognize your sincere desire to carry out my request. Please accept this token of my appreciation.
 8541: What would happen should all of the devices be activated? I really couldn't say.
 8542: However, I am assured that... Ah...never mind.
 8543: However, how am I to seal...? Ah...never mind.

 8597: <Match $0> Entry period begins: Briefing begins:
 8598: I apologize, but your level is too low to participate in an official Brenner match.
 8599: Official matches are scheduled to begin at the following times: Match 1: Match 2: Match 3:
 8600: Teleportation to the Isle is free of charge, but a participation fee of $0 gil is required before each match.
 8601: Travel to the Isle? [Yes./Not yet.]
 8602: What would you like to know about? [Basic rules./Official/private matches./Flammen-Brenner./Flamme./Match score./Petras and quarrying./Sprint./KO./Return.]
 8603: The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:
 8604: First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of "Flammen-Brenner."
 8605: At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with "Flamme," or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.
 8606: Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.
 8607: The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.
 8608: The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.
 8609: If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The "match score" section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.
 8610: Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.
 8611: You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.
 8612: No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.
 8613: The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed $0 members, or if there are fewer than $1 members in a match where the two sides' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.
 8614: Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The Master of Ceremonies (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.
 8615: "LS Liga" is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.
 8616: A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.
 8617: The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.
 8618: If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.
 8619: After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.
 8620: Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.
 8621: In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.
 8622: Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.
 8623: Like Ballista, quarry (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up Petras and temporary items.
 8624: However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can trade a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.
 8625: Sprint cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the scout ability cannot be used in Brenner.
 8626: Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.
 8627: The sprint (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player's speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.
 8628: In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.
 8629: In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.
 8630: I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?
 8631: I was thinking this out loud when an Elvaan girl passing by stopped to talk to me.
 8632: But what about moogles? They've got wings, and they can fly, but you wouldn't call 'em birds. They've got those funny antennae, too, but they're not insects, either.
 8633: When I responded to her remark with the fact that both moogles and chocobos are animals, this is what she asked:
 8634: Then what's the difference between animals and people?
 8635: I answered, "People are smarter than animals." And then she retorted, "People sure are more sly!"
 8636: Ahahaha, don't get all huffy on me! I stopped to talk because what you were saying was important.
 8637: People are all different from one another. They're different from animals, and different from plants. This difference is what makes it all worth it.
 8638: There are lots of ways to think and feel, and things to know and to believe. But in the end, we all come from the same source.
 8639: That's true for both people and animals.
 8640: We all have this thing called a soul. The souls of animals are pure and simple.
 8641: Look over there. That chocobo is living proof.
 8642: You should ask someone how that chocobo was born. Then you'll have your answers.
 8643: ...And then she went on her way.
 8644: I went to find out how that chocobo was born, but no one could tell me.
 8645: Shalott said the chocobo's mother was from the stables in Bastok.
 8646: She said it was a special chocobo that had silver-colored feathers on its neck.
 8647: How I wish I could go to Bastok to see her for myself.
 8648: I wonder if that Elvaan girl will be passing by again anytime soon...
 8649: That Elvaan girl told me that both people and animals have souls. She said that the souls of animals are far more pure than those of people.
 8650: She also told me I would understand what she meant if I found out how that chocobo was born.
 8651: According to Shalott, the chocobo's mother is from the stables in Bastok. How I wish I could go there to see her for myself...
 8652: What can I do for you? If you want to ride a chocobo, one of the girls over there can help you out.
 8653: Lately, a lot of adventurers seem to be forgetting that a chocobo is an animal, not an object.
 8654: You should keep that in mind as you're enjoying that easy ride through monster-ridden badlands. Have a safe journey.
 8655: A chocobo with silver-colored feathers...?
 8656: Ah, you'd be talking about Silver Comet.
 8657: She used to be the mount of a highly ranked general in the Bastokan navy.
 8658: The general's son received the chocobo as a coming-of-age present, which he promptly took advantage of to leave Bastok.
 8659: For the longest time, no one saw hide nor hair of man or beast--until eventually, Silver Comet came wandering back into town...alone.
 8660: I heard later on that the general's son had lost his life somewhere in the wilds.
 8661: Only Silver Comet had managed to return unharmed.
 8662: In memory of his son, the general asked us to take the chocobo into our care...
 8663: But then one day, Silver Comet was gone. Some chocobo thief had stolen her.
 8664: Hm? You say a chick of Silver Comet's is being kept in the Jeuno stables? You must be mistaken.
 8665: Anyway, after the theft, the general exhausted every avenue in search of his son's chocobo.
 8666: He eventually found an adventurer who allegedly saw a chocobo drowning in the Pashhow Marshlands.
 8667: That chocobo had the same markings as Silver Comet.
 8668: If you want to try talking to that adventurer, you should go to the outpost in the marshlands.
 8669: He's given up the adventuring life, it seems. Now he earns his daily bread by seeing to the needs of the soldiers at the outpost.
 8670: The gate is locked.
 8671: Whaddaya want? I got no time for adventurers.
 8672: Huh? Where'd you hear... Well, whatever.
 8673: You say you got business with me?
 8674: Silver Comet... What the hell are you bothering me about that old chocobo story for? You some kind of crackpot?
 8675: Leave me alone, you loon.
 8676: Can't you see I'm busy? This place gets too wet and too dark too quick to be wasting time chatting.
 8677: Hold up a minute. If you bring me some $1, I might be willing to give you the time of day.
 8678: Yep, three of those ought to do it. I'll give you until the day after tomorrow.
 8679: You brought what I asked for? Careful with that stuff, it's powerful smelly.
 8680: It's good for hiding a person's scent, you see. Helps me get around.
 8681: Now, then. You wanted to hear about that chocobo, right?
 8682: She was one of the fastest chocobos I've ever ridden, but damn near uncontrollable. I don't know how Silver Comet's owner handled her.
 8683: I guess the death of her former owner is what sent her off the edge. That chocobo wasn't right in the head.
 8684: She threw herself headlong into the marshes. Thought my number was up, I can tell you!
 8685: When I saw her in the stables, she was wearing a collar attached to a chain.
 8686: That wasn't to keep the general's mount from being stolen--it was to keep Silver Comet from flying the coop, so to speak.
 8687: That general's a real schemer. Said that if Silver Comet was released, she would be able to find Shooting Star.
 8688: It's his fault I almost got killed!
 8689: Huh? Who's Shooting Star? He's a chocobo, too.
 8690: Shooting Star was Silver Comet's mate.
 8691: Their love was a pure, uncomplicated thing, much more so than what people feel.
 8692: Ahahaha! I think this oil is starting to muddle my senses. I'll see you around, adventurer.
 8693: Were you able to meet with that adventurer?
 8694: ...Is that right? I think you were around that $1 a bit too long.
 8695: It sounds to me like that adventurer was the one who stole Silver Comet in the first place.
 8696: Or at least you would think so, if the thief wasn't supposed to have drowned in the marsh as well.
 8697: You mentioned a "Shooting Star"? I know that name.
 8698: That chocobo was raised alongside Silver Comet. Those two were almost inseparable as chicks.
 8699: Unfortunately, unlike Silver Comet's case, Shooting Star died saving his master.
 8700: I'm guessing Silver Comet was trying to find him when she jumped into that marsh. The general mentioned something similar at the time, I recall.
 8701: Hm? Still trying to convince me that her chick is in Jeuno?
 8702: I'm sorry, but I really think you're mistaken. I mean, the general even had Silver Comet's collar.
 8703: He said he was going to lay it on his son's grave in Batallia Downs.
 8704: But, wait. I seem to remember that collar being sent by a man named Brutus. He runs a chocobo stable in Jeuno...
 8705: Why would the collar be sent from Jeuno when Silver Comet drowned in the Pashhow Marshlands?
 8706: You are being attacked!
 8707: Now is not the time for that!
 8708: You sense something is not quite right...
 8709: You find nothing.
 8710: I...I don't know what you're talking about.
 8711: Wow... So this collar belonged to that chocobo's mother, Silver Comet?
 8712: I would place this on the grave of her mate, Shooting Star, if I only knew where it was.
 8713: So you're the two snoopers who were asking Shalott about Silver Comet.
 8714: That collar...!?
 8715: You've dug pretty far into this old story. Looks like after twenty years, people start to let things slip.
 8716: Please don't be angry, Brutus.
 8717: I found out that chocobos can fall in love, just like people do.
 8718: There was a girl who taught me that animals and people are the same.
 8719: I think the story of Silver Comet and Shooting Star helped me to really understand what she meant.
 8720: Well then, I suppose I'll have to tell you the whole tale.
 8721: Silver Comet and Shooting Star never really died.
 8722: Really!?
 8723: Shooting Star was a special chocobo that was attacked by an evil man.
 8724: He was badly wounded when they brought him here, and we all worked hard to get him back on his feet.
 8725: But Shooting Star was still being chased by the evil man, so we had to hide him away.
 8726: We took him to a place in the west of Batallia Downs, where that villain would never find him.
 8727: But the bad man was clever. He knew that if he had Silver Comet, her bond to Shooting Star would lead them right to the chocobo's hiding place.
 8728: Silver Comet was one smart chocobo, though.
 8729: She deliberately dove into the marshes to force the villain from her back.
 8730: It was an extremely dangerous thing for Silver Comet to do.
 8731: But she never gave up. She had to protect her mate from the man who meant to hurt him.
 8732: Silver Comet swam through the muck and dragged herself free of the marshlands. She was finally able to make it to Shooting Star's side.
 8733: That's when I took off her collar and set her free.
 8734: What happened to them after that?
 8735: Did they live happily ever after?
 8736: That's right. And the youngest of the brood they raised together is that chocobo right over there.
 8737: What a great story...
 8738: It's not over yet. The villain of this tale is still lurking around somewhere.
 8739: That's why you can never tell anybody what you've heard here today. You want to keep that chocobo safe, right?
 8740: Right!
 8741: I'll never tell, I promise!
 8742: Glad to hear it. And one more thing...
 8743: Don't forget how Silver Comet never gave up on her mate.
 8744: Even when those they love and believe in have gone, animals will keep on striving.
 8745: Right. That's because animals come from the same source as people.
 8746: Adventurer, you can have this. Keep this story to yourself.
 8747: Thank you so much! And this is from me.
 8748: I wonder if that Elvaan girl knows how Silver Comet and Shooting Star were married.
 8749: I would like to meet her again some day...
 8750: Press any button to continue.
 8751: At the request of a certain society, I am investigating the effects of the dreaded "Emptiness" on living beings.
 8752: You appear to be a well-traveled adventurer. Perhaps you have seen one of the Emptiness-ravaged creatures of which I speak?
 8753: We have labeled these monstrosities "Empty Notorious Monsters," or ENMs...
 8754: Have you seen one? [Indeed I have./I'm not quite sure...]
 8755: Aha, so you have firsthand experience. You probably don't need a scholar's explanation, but please indulge me...
 8756: The material presence of ENMs has become temporary and insubstantial, meaning that those who have witnessed a particular ENM's existence are unable to encounter it again until a period of time has passed.
 8757: My research has allowed me to measure the length of time between ENM manifestations. Tell me, which ENM would you like to know about?
 8758: I wish to know about the ENM in... [Nowhere in particular./The Spire of Holla./The Spire of Dem./The Spire of Mea./The Spire of Vahzl./Monarch Linn./The Shrouded Maw./Mine Shaft #2716./Bearclaw Pinnacle./Boneyard Gully.]
 8759: You won't be able to encounter that particular ENM until ( Earth time).
 8760: The ENM in that area should be sufficiently manifest for your next encounter.
 8761: You have no need of my expertise at the moment? Very well.
 8762: And now we come to the crux of the matter...
 8763: If there is an ENM that you are currently able to locate, I strongly urge you to take action.
 8764: These...creatures...are no longer natural beings of Vana'diel. They must be destroyed.
 8765: I cannot elaborate on the details, but know that the fate of the world depends on the early elimination of this threat...
 8766: Then perhaps it is best if you forget this conversation entirely.
 8767: I hope I have been of some assistance to you.
 8768: This dark plague grows ever stronger... If it is not stopped soon...
 8769: Which item will you use to enter? [6./$6.]
 8770: <Player>! Lady Esha'ntarl's ship has returned.
 8771: This is excellent timing. I was ordered to find you and ask that you proceed to the Marble Bridge--the tavern in Upper Jeuno.
 8772: My duty here is done. I must now journey to each nation and report that the Wyrmking Bahamut no longer poses a threat.
 8773: I hear that this development is all thanks to you and your companions. You have the gratitude of all Jeunoans.
 8774: I have awaited your return, <Player>. You must tell me all that has happened.
 8775: After clashing with our army several times, the dragons suddenly broke off their attack and disappeared into the distant clouds.
 8776: There were voices raised in support of hunting the wyrms into extinction, but for the moment we have returned to resupply and reconsider our position.
 8777: Now that you are here, I can finally be certain.
 8778: Am I to assume from your jubilant features that the Keeper of the Apocalypse has been defeated?
 8779: Has the keeper been defeated? [Completely./Who can say?]
 8780: I knew it! Bahamut sensed the keeper's downfall and pulled his forces out of battle...
 8781: Tell me. What momentous events transpired in the Celestial Capital?
 8782: On Cape Riverne, the images that flowed into me from Selh'teus...
 8783: They were of the incomplete Paradise, Al'Taieu...
 8784: The people of Al'Taieu returned to their deity ten thousand years ago. Returned to Promathia...
 8785: "Opening the Gates of Paradise" is a metaphor for restoring the shattered mothercrystal. A way to return the world to its original state.
 8786: The world becomes a paradise, and its people ascend to godhood. The Dawnmaiden Yve'noile has memories of witnessing the true form of the great goddess Altana.
 8787: Yve'noile spoke to me before we parted ways.
 8788: She said, "As I gazed upon her perfection, I realized I could not be a part of her. I wondered who I could possibly be."
 8789: That was when she began her research into the race of people.
 8790: After shifting her focus to the inexplicable appearance of the Kuluu phenomenon, Yve'noile became aware of the darkness that resided within us all.
 8791: Her realization led her to betray the king and his son, and adamantly oppose any plan to open the Gates of Paradise.
 8792: She had discovered our origins as the children of Promathia...
 8793: But all has not been resolved.
 8794: The Emptiness still seethes within the mothercrystals.
 8795: And the surviving Zilart yet cling desperately to their shadowy plan of returning to Paradise.
 8796: I gave up my life in Tavnazia almost thirty years ago to infiltrate the organization of the newly awakened Zilart.
 8797: But I have been unable to stem their vast power on my own.
 8798: However, we now have a common enemy in the Emptiness. For a time, the people of this age will require the aid of the ancients.
 8799: The ancients, too, will need your continuing help.
 8800: Surely the Dawn Maiden has bequeathed something of value to her younger kin.
 8801: I will find out what this may be, and speak with Archduke Kam'lanaut. He will heed my words.
 8802: I shall continue to watch over the world that you and your companions have fought so valiantly to protect.
 8803: Now that Nag'molada is gone and the wyrms have ceased their attacks, it is time to remind the Zilart of their true responsibility:
 8804: The safety of the mothercrystals and the battle against the Emptiness.
 8805: I will continue to monitor their actions as I watch over the world that you and your companions have fought so valiantly to protect.
 8806: There is one thing I'd like you to keep in mind, <Player>.
 8807: You were able to save the world and her people without sacrificing one or the other.
 8808: But do not misunderstand.
 8809: This possibility did not always exist.
 8810: It was only with the strength and faith of many people that such a path could open before you.
 8811: I have left with the owner of this tavern three rewards that may help you on your adventures. Feel free to choose one.
 8812: Until our paths cross once more, <Player>.
 8813: Thank you, and farewell.
 8814: There're so many people in this town. It takes me by surprrrise no matter how many times I come here.
 8815: All this activity makes it difficult to get anything done. It's enough to make my whiskers curl.
 8816: I don't think you'd be able to help me out, though. Why don't you rrrun along?
 8817: Hey, you there. You wouldn't happen to have a little time up your sleeve, would you?
 8818: I'm looking for some assistance, you see.
 8819: I have to find out if these people are carrying a certain type of mirror. Look at the size of this list! Have you ever seen so many names!?
 8820: I could rrreally use some help. What do you say?
 8821: Help out? [Sure./Not right now.]
 8822: Rrreally!? What a generous soul you are!
 8823: There's a rrreward involved, so don't be too hasty with your rrreply!
 8824: That's a shame... There's a rrreward involved, so let me know if you change your mind, or if your schedule frrrees up, okay?
 8825: Take a look at this list. I want you to choose one person and see what information you can dig up on them. Do you think you can handle that?
 8826: Rrridiculously long, isn't it? And this list is only for Jeuno. Makes my tail droop just thinking about it.

 8845: This is your choice? [This is the one./Let me see the list again.]
 8846: Great, time to put your detective hat on.
 8847: Oh, and the mirror? It's one of several rrrare treasures that we've been searching for. I'll tell you more about it once you bring me some information.
 8848: Better be on your way while the trail's still warm!
 8849: Better be on your way while the trail's still warm!

 8870: Now that you mention it, I might have seen the person you're looking for. An adventurer, right?
 8871: Always looking into some mirror. It kind of stuck in my mind.
 8872: It's like this adventurer was searching for something. I guess that's what you guys do, though.
 8873: Stick around here long enough and maybe you'll get lucky. Everyone comes back to Jeuno eventually.
 8874: Hmm... This information will help a great deal.
 8875: You're a lot sharper than you look. I might have some more work for you to do.
 8876: What do you think? Are you willing to lend us your services a little longer?
 8877: My associates and I are treasure hunters. We presently have our eyes on baubles of Near Eastern origin.
 8878: The mirror I mentioned earlier could be just what we're looking for, but our sources are a little shaky...
 8879: In other words, we're still in the information-gathering stage. That's where your keen investigative skills will come in handy.
 8880: Here's a little incentive. Check in with me again soon.
 8881: Ah, my favorite customer! A pretty blonde came in earlier and asked me to hold on to some things for you.
 8882: There are three items in total, but I'm only supposed to give you one...
 8883: So, what'll it be?
 8884: Which do you choose? [Let me think about it./$0./$1./$2.]
 8885: The $0? Is that your final decision?
 8886: Do you choose the $0? [Yes./I've changed my mind.]
 8887: A fine choice, [sir/madame].
 8888: Making these kind of choices is difficult, isn't it? That blonde lady sure has a strange sense of humor. Oh dear, there I go criticizing my customers again...
 8889: Still can't decide? Well, I'll be happy to look after them for the time being. Please come again!
 8890: I'm sorry, [sir/madame], but it wouldn't be right for me to force any more luggage on such a heavily laden person...
 8891: Where could she be...? I pray to Altana nothing has happened to her...
 8892: Excuse me. You haven't seen a little girl anywhere, have you? My daughter has gone missing...
 8893: Are you talking to us?
 8894: Yes, could you help me look for her?
 8895: If you're looking for someone, then <Player> here is your [man/woman]. [He/She] has a knack for finding people.
 8896: Then please, find my daughter. She has blonde hair and is wearing a brown dress.
 8897: She should be wearing a brown cap as well. Oh, how she loves that little cap...<sniff>
 8898: She went out to play, and never came back...
 8899: Great Goddess, I don't know what I'd do if I lost her...
 8900: Must be harrrd to have a child go missing.
 8901: But I have no time for family drrramas. Missing treasure would be a whole other story, of course.
 8902: Hey there. I ran into [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji] a little while back...
 8903: Hey there. I ran into [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde] a little while back...
 8904: Hey there. I ran into [Chanandit/Deulmaeux/Demresinaux/Ephealgaux/Gauldeval/Grauffemart/Migaifongut/Romidiant] a little while back...
 8905: Hey there. I ran into [Armittie/Cadepure/Clearite/Epilleve/Liabelle/Nauthima/Radille/Vimechue] a little while back...
 8906: Hey there. I ran into [Balu-Falu/Burg-Ladarg/Ehgo-Ryuhgo/Kolui-Pelui/Nokum-Akkum/Savul-Kivul/Vinja-Kanja/Yarga-Umiga] a little while back...
 8907: Hey there. I ran into [Cupapa/Jajuju/Kalokoko/Mahoyaya/Pakurara/Ripokeke/Yawawa/Yufafa] a little while back...
 8908: Hey there. I ran into [Fhig Lahrv/Khuma Tagyawhan/Pimy Kettihl/Raka Maimhov/Sahyu Banjyao/Sufhi Uchnouma/Tsuim Nhomango/Yoli Kohlpaka] a little while back...
 8909: Hey there. I ran into [Durib/Dzapiwa/Jugowa/Mugido/Voldai/Wagwei/Zayag/Zoldof] a little while back...
 8910: Said something about heading to the Eldieme Necropolis.
 8911: Huh? Now you're looking for a little girl that's gone missing? Well, what did she look like?
 8912: Hmm. Now, where did I see...
 8913: Ah! That's it!
 8914: She was talking to the person you were looking for. I wasn't really paying attention to where she was headed, though...
 8915: Sorry I can't help you out more. I'll let you know if I find out anything.
 8916: Well, if it isn't <Player>. Keeping busy?
 8917: It's nice of you to come say hello, but I'm afrrraid I have no news to give you.
 8918: Palometa...!
 8919: Mommy!
 8920: Oh, I'm so glad you're okay! Are you unhurt? Let me take a look at you! Thank Altana! And thank you, adventurers!
 8921: You found her, huh? Where had she wandered off to?
 8922: The Eldieme Necropolis? How did you know she'd be there? I'm imprrressed.
 8923: That nice [man/lady/man/lady/man/lady/lady/man] found me by using a magic mirror!
 8924: Is that rrright!?
 8925: Lucky for you, huh? And this is the "nice [man/lady/man/lady/man/lady/lady/man]" you were talking about?
 8926: Uhuh!
 8927: Pleased to make your acquaintance. I am a seeker of all things mystical. Would you mind telling me a little about the mirror you hold?
 8928: I don't usually like to tell people about it, but I guess it couldn't hurt. This mirror is known as the Glass of All-Seeing. Never heard of it, right?
 8929: Well, I don't usually make a point of going on about it, but this mirror is called the Glass of All-Seeing. Ever heard of it?
 8930: You know, I don't usually mention it to people, but since you asked... This mirror is called the Glass of All-Seeing. Ever heard of it?
 8931: I must confess to keeping quiet about my mirror, but I suppose I could tell you... It is known as the Glass of All-Seeing. Perhaps you've heard of it?
 8932: I don't usually tell people about it, but I suppose it wouldn't hurt to let you know. This mirror's called the Glass of All-Seeing. Ever heard of it?
 8933: I prefer not to tell anyone about it...but what the heck. This here, is the Glass of All-Seeing. Heard of it before?
 8934: Actually, I don't usually talk about it at all. But since you asked... This mirror is known as the Glass of All-Seeing. Maybe you've heard of it?
 8935: Well, I don't usually go blabbing to people about it, but since you asked... This mirror is known as the Glass of All-Seeing. Maybe you've heard of it?
 8936: I haven't made a practice of advertising its powers, but... This mirror is known as the Glass of All-Seeing. Maybe you've heard of it?
 8937: You want to know about my mirror? Well, this here treasure is known as the Glass of All-Seeing. You must've heard of it.
 8938: I must confess to keeping quiet about my mirror, but I suppose I could tell you... It is known as the Glass of All-Seeing. Perhaps you've heard of it?
 8939: I don't often reveal information about this mirror--the Glass of All-Seeing, to others, but I suppose I could make an exception. Perhaps you have heard of it?
 8940: The Glass of All-Seeing... No, the name doesn't rrring any bells. How did you come to possess such a wondrrrous item?
 8941: It is a family heirloom. Its powers have guided me along my path.
 8942: This mirror has been in my family for generations. It has shown me the way whenever I became lost.
 8943: This mirror is a family heirloom. Its powers have guided me along my path.
 8944: This mirror has been passed down from generation to generation. It has been my guiding light down many a dark path.
 8945: It was passed down to me by my parents, and has been a guiding light in my life.
 8946: My family's had this mirror for as long as I can remember. I honestly don't know where I'd be without it to guide me.
 8947: This mirror is a family heirloom. Its power shows me the path forward.
 8948: This mirror has been in my family forever! It guides me along my path in life.
 8949: It was handed down to me by my mother. Its power has guided my steps for as long as I can remember.
 8950: It's been in my family for years and years! I'd be totally lost without it!
 8951: This mirror has been passed down from generation to generation. It has been my guiding light down many a dark path.
 8952: This mirror is a family heirloom. It guides my actions in a manner not dissimilar to a mentor.
 8953: The Glass of All-Seeing brought me here to Jeuno.
 8954: The Glass of All-Seeing brought me here to Jeuno.
 8955: The Glass of All-Seeing brought me here to Jeuno.

 8963: The Glass of All-Seeing brought me here to Jeuno.
 8964: The Glass of All-Seeing brought me here to Jeuno.
 8965: Simply amazing. Even among all the incrrredible treasures I have beheld, this mirror belongs to an entirely differrrent class.
 8966: This Glass of All-Seeing must have its origins in the Near East.
 8967: I have a special interrrest in baubles from that area.
 8968: <Player> is assisting me with some information gathering. Do you think you could lend your skills as well?
 8969: What do you think?
 8970: This is where I have been led. And there is more I want to know about this mirror.
 8971: There must be a reason I was led here. And there is more I want to know about this mirror.
 8972: I came here under the guidance of the mirror. And there are things about the Glass of All-Seeing that I need to know...
 8973: It can be no coincidence that I have been led here. And there is still much I wish to learn about this mirror.
 8974: I'm sure there's a good reason why the mirror has led me here. There's so much more I want to learn about it!
 8975: There's a lot I still don't know about this mirror... But it wouldn't have led me to you without a good reason!
 8976: The mirror has led me here. And there is still much about it I don't know...
 8977: Well, I'm here now! And there may be something else I can discover about this mirror...
 8978: This is the path that has been laid before me. And there is more I wish to discover about this mirror...
 8979: The mirror brought me to you. And there are still some things about it that confuse me...
 8980: It can be no coincidence that I have been led here. And there is still much I wish to learn about this mirror.
 8981: The mirror would not have guided me here for a trivial reason. There is still much from it that I must learn.
 8982: So yes, I will help you. Just remember that I won't give up the Glass of All-Seeing under any circumstances.
 8983: So yes, I will help you. Just remember that I can't give up the Glass of All-Seeing to anyone.
 8984: So yes, I will help you. But don't think that I'll be giving up the mirror to you, or anyone.
 8985: So yes, I will aid you in your cause. However, please be aware that I cannot give up the Glass of All-Seeing to anyone.
 8986: So yes, I'll be happy to help. It's just that I can't give the mirror away.
 8987: So the answer's yes, I'll help you out--as long as it doesn't mean giving up the Glass of All-Seeing. I trust you understand.
 8988: So yes, I will help you. But just remember that I won't give up the mirror for any price.
 8989: So yes, I will help you. Just don't go thinking that you'll be able to buy the mirror from me.
 8990: So yes. I will help you. But be warned that I won't sell the Glass of All-Seeing to anyone.
 8991: So sure, I'll help you. But just remember that the Glass of All-Seeing is not for sale. Not even for a million gil!

 8995: What a rare trrreasure. If I ever rrran across such an item, I would stare into it until my fur turned grrray!
 8996: The scent of treasure on you is making my nose twitch. Some people have all the luck...
 8997: <Player>! Nice timing. We've just got a lead on a new piece of trrreasure.
 8998: This new valuable is one of the mirrors we're searching for, but we're having trrrouble pinning down its location.
 8999: I've called on [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji] to help us. And speaking of which...
 9000: I've called on [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde] to help us. And speaking of which...
 9001: I've called on [Chanandit/Deulmaeux/Demresinaux/Ephealgaux/Gauldeval/Grauffemart/Migaifongut/Romidiant] to help us. And speaking of which...
 9002: I've called on [Armittie/Cadepure/Clearite/Epilleve/Liabelle/Nauthima/Radille/Vimechue] to help us. And speaking of which...
 9003: I've called on [Balu-Falu/Burg-Ladarg/Ehgo-Ryuhgo/Kolui-Pelui/Nokum-Akkum/Savul-Kivul/Vinja-Kanja/Yarga-Umiga] to help us. And speaking of which...
 9004: I've called on [Cupapa/Jajuju/Kalokoko/Mahoyaya/Pakurara/Ripokeke/Yawawa/Yufafa] to help us. And speaking of which...
 9005: I've called on [Fhig Lahrv/Khuma Tagyawhan/Pimy Kettihl/Raka Maimhov/Sahyu Banjyao/Sufhi Uchnouma/Tsuim Nhomango/Yoli Kohlpaka] to help us. And speaking of which...
 9006: I've called on [Durib/Dzapiwa/Jugowa/Mugido/Voldai/Wagwei/Zayag/Zoldof] to help us. And speaking of which...
 9007: I have a favorrr to ask you. Can you use your Glass of All-Seeing to locate the treasure we seek?
 9008: Sure, I guess.
 9009: Of course! Leave it to me!
 9010: Sure, no problem.
 9011: Why yes, of course.
 9012: You got it!
 9013: Okay! Happy to oblige.
 9014: Happy to help.
 9015: Of course! Leave it to me!
 9016: Sure, I don't mind.
 9017: You want my help? Sure!
 9018: Why yes, of course.
 9019: Hm, sounds reasonable.
 9020: Seems to be somewhere near San d'Oria. I can't tell you any more than that. Sorry.
 9021: I'm getting a sense that it's somewhere near San d'Oria! I can't tell you any more than that, though...
 9022: Looks like your treasure is near San d'Oria! I can't tell you any more than that.
 9023: It appears that your treasure is somewhere in the vicinity of San d'Oria. The mirror shows nothing more, I'm afraid.
 9024: Okay. Looks like it's somewhere near San d'Oria. I'm afraid that's all I can see.
 9025: This is a tough one. The mirror points towards San d'Oria, but I can't say where, exactly.
 9026: Seems to be somewhere near San d'Oria... I can't tell you any more than that.
 9027: I'm getting a sense that it's somewhere near San d'Oria! I can't tell you any more than that, though...
 9028: Somewhere near San d'Oria... That's all I can tell you.
 9029: Looks like it's somewhere near San d'Oria. Ooh, I like San d'Oria! Doesn't show anything else, though...
 9030: It appears that your treasure is somewhere in the vicinity of San d'Oria. The mirror shows nothing more, I'm afraid.
 9031: Hmmm... The mirror reveals your trinket is somewhere near San d'Oria. That is all.
 9032: Well, that certainly is vague. Does this mean that someone is carrying it around?
 9033: To tell the truth, the mirror we seek now is somewhat...dangerous. This fact has prevented us from going after it on our own.
 9034: But now we have a brrrave adventurer in our rrranks, right? Time for you to show your spirrrit.
 9035: The open rrroad awaits!
 9036: That mirror should hold powers similar to the Glass of All-Seeing.
 9037: Sends a thrill down my spine...
 9038: Welcome back. How did everything go?
 9039: Can I assume frrrom the look on your face that you found the mirror?
 9040: Well, aren't you going to show it to me?
 9041: It's cracked!? You can't be serrrious!
 9042: If it was to save <Player>'s life, I suppose you had no choice...
 9043: I asked you to trrrack down the mirror, even though there were dangers involved. I'm in no position to crrriticize.
 9044: You say it was feeding power to a drrragon? What a dreadful object.
 9045: It is beautiful, though...
 9046: Mirrors have always held a fascination for me, you see.
 9047: It's satisfying just to know that the trrreasure I was searching for actually existed.
 9048: But even with these cracks, we must treat the mirror with caution. Who knows what other secrrrets it may hide?
 9049: I'll look after it for the time being.
 9050: Thank you, Luto. ...Hm?
 9051: Thanks, Luto! ...Hm?
 9052: Thanks, Luto. ...Hm?
 9053: Our thanks, Luto. ...Hm?

 9090: I knew we were supposed to meet. Here, I want you to have this.
 9091: You know, I'm not at all surprised. I'd felt something from the moment we met. Here, take this.
 9092: It seems our paths lie together. You should have this.
 9093: I knew there was something special about you! You should have this!
 9094: The mirror never lies. It seems our fates are linked. ...You should have this.
 9095: Do you know what this means? We were destined to be friends! You should have this!
 9096: Well, well. I knew there was something special about you. You should have this.
 9097: There is more than meets the eye with you, it seems. Hold on to this.

 9188: Should you find saying my full name a daunting task, you may call me by my first name.
 9189: <Player>, I have a question for you. How do you go about choosing a weapon?
 9190: I met [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji] at the weapon store earlier, and he said that he always makes his decision after using the weapon or shield in real combat.

 9197: I met [Durib/Dzapiwa/Jugowa/Mugido/Voldai/Wagwei/Zayag/Zoldof] at the weapon store earlier, and he said that he always makes his decision after using the weapon or shield in real combat.
 9198: While that does make sense in theory, I shudder to think how much gil you would go through if you couldn't make up your mind. Anyway, I didn't notice any new weapons being bought by our mutual friend...
 9199: Here's an idea. If you have any spare weapons lying arrround, why don't you lend them to [him/her/him/her/him/her/her/him]?
 9200: But rrrather than just handing over some expensive axe or jeweled dagger, why not start with some beginner's gear for prrractice?
 9201: If you leave the weapon with me, I'll be happy to make sure it gets to [him/her/him/her/him/her/her/him].
 9202: You can trrrust me! I'm only interested in trrreasure. The weapon will get to [him/her/him/her/him/her/her/him].

 9212: Why don't you help [him/her/him/her/him/her/her/him] out and leave a new weapon or shield with me?

 9222: What can I do for you?
 9223: What's up? [Anything new happening?/I want to start over.]
 9224: Hmmm. Nothing at the moment. Check back with me again later.
 9225: Are you serrrious?
 9226: Are you serious? [Dead serious./No, not really.]

 9236: Are you okay with that? [Doesn't bother me./Never? Wait a minute...]
 9237: Please don't play games with me, <Player>.
 9238: Fine. Hand over the $1 and we'll forget any of this ever happened.

 9247: Now, fix your eyes on this for me...
 9248: Returning the $1 will errrase all that has happened between us. Are you certain you want to go through with this?
 9249: Are you certain? [Maybe not.../Positively.]
 9250: Well, I'm glad to hear that, <Player>. Don't you ever scare me like that again!
 9251: I see you've made up your mind.
 9252: Thanks to you, I got my paws on some great information. Be in touch.
 9253: Here's a little incentive. Check in with me again soon.
 9254: Hi, <Player>. I've been holding on to this for you. It seems to be quite important, so trrry not to lose it, okay?
 9255: Hey there, friend. The name's Luto Mewrilah. Can I interest you in the incredibly entertaining $3?
 9256: Just a fur-lickin' second there, buster! I'm Luto Mewrilah! What are you trrrying to pull?
 9257: Pull? I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about.
 9258: That's my name and my face!
 9259: They were mine last time I looked.
 9260: Miss, you're really trrrying my patience...
 9261: Could we continue this later? I'm in the middle of a sales pitch for my $3.
 9262: 3...?
 9263: First, we have the amazing "knitted cap." With this little number, you can instantly transform yourself into an adorable child. Presto change-o!
 9264: I feel younger already!
 9265: Oh, it's you. What's the big deal with stealing my face for your sideshow tricks?
 9266: Heh heh. Just having a little fun. Surprised?
 9267: "Surprised" isn't the word for it. I see you're still using the kiddy cap.
 9268: This child is... ...You know, I can't introduce you looking like that.
 9269: Change back to your normal form.
 9270: Okay, okay. Here we go!
 9271: ...
 9272: Huh?
 9273: Why am I still...?
 9274: What's wrrrong?
 9275: I can't change back...
 9276: What do you mean, you can't change back!?
 9277: Hmmm, this has never happened to me before...
 9278: Could there be some prrroblem with the cap?
 9279: It was fine the last time I used it.
 9280: Did you do something different the last time?
 9281: Not that I can remember.
 9282: Well, there must be something you did if it's not working now. Why don't we try going back to the place you last used the cap?
 9283: That would have been...Ru'Lude Gardens.
 9284: <Player>, would you mind tagging along? I'll explain everything later.
 9285: You go on ahead. I'll meet you in Ru'Lude Gardens.
 9286: You should be able to purchase $6 from a goods store in Bastok. I would really apprrreciate it, <Player>.
 9287: Thanks for brrringing the dust, <Player>, but our little friend has learned a new trick. Vanishing.
 9288: Hm? You've seen him already? And he's still messing around with those costumes!?
 9289: He'll never learn!
 9290: Well hey, if it isn't [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji].
 9291: Well hey, if it isn't [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde].
 9292: Well hey, if it isn't [Chanandit/Deulmaeux/Demresinaux/Ephealgaux/Gauldeval/Grauffemart/Migaifongut/Romidiant].
 9293: Well hey, if it isn't [Armittie/Cadepure/Clearite/Epilleve/Liabelle/Nauthima/Radille/Vimechue].
 9294: Well hey, if it isn't [Balu-Falu/Burg-Ladarg/Ehgo-Ryuhgo/Kolui-Pelui/Nokum-Akkum/Savul-Kivul/Vinja-Kanja/Yarga-Umiga].
 9295: Well hey, if it isn't [Cupapa/Jajuju/Kalokoko/Mahoyaya/Pakurara/Ripokeke/Yawawa/Yufafa].
 9296: Well hey, if it isn't [Fhig Lahrv/Khuma Tagyawhan/Pimy Kettihl/Raka Maimhov/Sahyu Banjyao/Sufhi Uchnouma/Tsuim Nhomango/Yoli Kohlpaka].
 9297: Well hey, if it isn't [Durib/Dzapiwa/Jugowa/Mugido/Voldai/Wagwei/Zayag/Zoldof].
 9298: Perrrfect timing. You can split up and track down that errant shape-shifter.
 9299: He's a good friend of mine, you see. The thing is...
 9300: ...and that's the whole story.
 9301: It's the constant shape-shifting that's getting him into trouble.
 9302: Taking on new appearances isn't going to help. He has to get back to his original form.
 9303: First things first. Tracking down the little trickster...
 9304: You may want to try looking around Delkfutt's Tower.
 9305: We should try looking around Delkfutt's Tower first!
 9306: Delkfutt's Tower could be a good place to start.
 9307: Well, then. I suggest we start our search in the vicinity of Delkfutt's Tower.
 9308: How about looking around Delkfutt's Tower?
 9309: Why don't we search the area around Delkfutt's Tower?
 9310: Why don't we try looking around Delkfutt's Tower?
 9311: We should try looking around Delkfutt's Tower first!
 9312: Perhaps we should begin our search around Delkfutt's Tower?
 9313: I know! I know! Let's start looking near Delkfutt's Tower!
 9314: Well, then. I suggest we start our search in the vicinity of Delkfutt's Tower.
 9315: I say Delkfutt's Tower's surrounds would be a good place to search.
 9316: Delkfutt's Tower? Any parrrticular reason?
 9317: I'm not sure, but something tells me he's there.
 9318: Just a feeling I'm getting...
 9319: Call it a hunch...
 9320: I'm not entirely certain, but my intuition is pointing me in that direction.
 9321: I don't know how to explain it. I just feel something.
 9322: I'd be hard-pressed to explain why. You just have to believe me.
 9323: I could be wrong, but that's what my intuition is telling me.
 9324: Sometimes you just know these things!
 9325: Call it intuition...
 9326: You know, I don't really know! Just a hunch...
 9327: I'm not entirely certain, but my intuition is pointing me in that direction.
 9328: I am loath to rely on intuition alone. But I can offer no explanation apart from that.
 9329: Well, I've heard of strrranger things. Off to Delkfutt's Tower!

 9357: You wish to see [Durib/Dzapiwa/Jugowa/Mugido/Voldai/Wagwei/Zayag/Zoldof]? Perfect timing. I have just finished treating him.
 9358: A serious injury? No, I would not say it is that bad. As long as your friend does not do anything rash, recovery should not take long.
 9359: Ah, [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji]. <Player> has come to visit you.
 9360: Ah, [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde]. <Player> has come to visit you.
 9361: Ah, [Chanandit/Deulmaeux/Demresinaux/Ephealgaux/Gauldeval/Grauffemart/Migaifongut/Romidiant]. <Player> has come to visit you.
 9362: Ah, [Armittie/Cadepure/Clearite/Epilleve/Liabelle/Nauthima/Radille/Vimechue]. <Player> has come to visit you.
 9363: Ah, [Balu-Falu/Burg-Ladarg/Ehgo-Ryuhgo/Kolui-Pelui/Nokum-Akkum/Savul-Kivul/Vinja-Kanja/Yarga-Umiga]. <Player> has come to visit you.
 9364: Ah, [Cupapa/Jajuju/Kalokoko/Mahoyaya/Pakurara/Ripokeke/Yawawa/Yufafa]. <Player> has come to visit you.
 9365: Ah, [Fhig Lahrv/Khuma Tagyawhan/Pimy Kettihl/Raka Maimhov/Sahyu Banjyao/Sufhi Uchnouma/Tsuim Nhomango/Yoli Kohlpaka]. <Player> has come to visit you.
 9366: Ah, [Durib/Dzapiwa/Jugowa/Mugido/Voldai/Wagwei/Zayag/Zoldof]. <Player> has come to visit you.
 9367: Ha, you shouldn't be so worried about me. This is no big deal.
 9368: Don't worry about me! This is just a scratch!
 9369: Hey, this is nothing. You have no need to worry.
 9370: There is no need for your concern. My injuries are minor.
 9371: You don't have to worry about me. I'm fine, really.
 9372: Good to see you as always, <Player>. But as you can see, this is a sorry excuse for an injury.
 9373: You shouldn't be so worried. This is nothing, really.
 9374: Hey, no reason to be worried! This is nothing!
 9375: You have no reason to worry. This is nothing.
 9376: Hehe, you shouldn't be so worried! I'm fine!
 9377: There is no need for your concern. My injuries are minor.
 9378: This is far from serious. Save your sympathy for another time.
 9379: Now that your friend is here, you should save your breath and let [him/her] escort you home.
 9380: I'm fine. I can do it alone.
 9381: I can make it back alone!
 9382: No need for that. I can go back alone.
 9383: I am fine. I can return alone.
 9384: It's okay, I can go by myself.
 9385: Hey, no need to blow it out of proportion, doc. I can go alone.
 9386: I'm okay. I can make it back alone.
 9387: I'm fine! I can go back alone!
 9388: I am just fine on my own, thanks.
 9389: No, that's okay! I can do it by myself!
 9390: I am fine. I can return alone.
 9391: Escort? Absolutely unnecessary. I've been in much worse shape than this.
 9392: Your friend is rather thankless, but I do believe that there is no cause for worry.
 9393: Oh, <Player>! How was [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji]?
 9394: Oh, <Player>! How was [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde]?
 9395: Oh, <Player>! How was [Chanandit/Deulmaeux/Demresinaux/Ephealgaux/Gauldeval/Grauffemart/Migaifongut/Romidiant]?
 9396: Oh, <Player>! How was [Armittie/Cadepure/Clearite/Epilleve/Liabelle/Nauthima/Radille/Vimechue]?
 9397: Oh, <Player>! How was [Balu-Falu/Burg-Ladarg/Ehgo-Ryuhgo/Kolui-Pelui/Nokum-Akkum/Savul-Kivul/Vinja-Kanja/Yarga-Umiga]?
 9398: Oh, <Player>! How was [Cupapa/Jajuju/Kalokoko/Mahoyaya/Pakurara/Ripokeke/Yawawa/Yufafa]?
 9399: Oh, <Player>! How was [Fhig Lahrv/Khuma Tagyawhan/Pimy Kettihl/Raka Maimhov/Sahyu Banjyao/Sufhi Uchnouma/Tsuim Nhomango/Yoli Kohlpaka]?
 9400: Oh, <Player>! How was [Durib/Dzapiwa/Jugowa/Mugido/Voldai/Wagwei/Zayag/Zoldof]?
 9401: So the injury wasn't so bad after all? That's good.
 9402: Is something the matter?
 9403: Someone I know is in the hospital...
 9404: Oh yes, I suppose I should introduce Pheauclemand herrre. I just met him recently, but he is the one who told me about a fearrrsome monster living in Qufim.
 9405: I passed the information on to [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji]...
 9406: I passed the information on to [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde]...
 9407: I passed the information on to [Chanandit/Deulmaeux/Demresinaux/Ephealgaux/Gauldeval/Grauffemart/Migaifongut/Romidiant]...

 9412: I passed the information on to [Durib/Dzapiwa/Jugowa/Mugido/Voldai/Wagwei/Zayag/Zoldof]...
 9413: I suggested that you two defeat the monster together, but I couldn't have imagined that your frrriend would attempt such a battle alone.
 9414: I am terribly sorry...
 9415: It wasn't yourrr fault, Pheauclemand.
 9416: No, I should never have mentioned it. That monster only brings misfortune to adventurers.
 9417: Long ago, I was an adventurer like you. I also had a close friend...
 9418: One day, he introduced his fianc<Player>ie to me.
 9419: Her name was Pelagia, and she was very beautiful.
 9420: They were planning to marry a few days later, and I was so happy for them.
 9421: However, he was badly injured just before his wedding and sent to the hospital.
 9422: A rumor spread through the streets that he had been defeated by a fearsome monster in Qufim.
 9423: When I went to the hospital, Pelagia was also there for some reason.
 9424: She had arrived at the hospital too late. When I arrived, Pelagia was already...
 9425: ...!
 9426: What on... What happened to Pelagia!?
 9427: ...
 9428: Did you go to Qufim? Did you take her to Qufim!?
 9429: Why would you take her to such a place!? You knew it was dangerous!
 9430: ...
 9431: Answer me!
 9432: He would not even say a single word to me...
 9433: His silence confused me, tortured me.
 9434: I never did find out what actually happened that day.
 9435: That was just the kind of person he was.
 9436: What a sad story! I don't want that to happen again.
 9437: I wonder where [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji] is now. Why don't you try contacting him with your signal pearl, <Player>?
 9438: I wonder where [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde] is now. Why don't you try contacting her with your signal pearl, <Player>?

 9457: Does it really matter? Hey, I'm busy now, so I'll catch you later.
 9458: Who cares, anyway? Let's talk later. I gotta go!
 9459: Does it matter? I'm busy now. Later.
 9460: I am afraid that does not concern you. I am busy now, so let us talk later.
 9461: I'm...nowhere. Sorry, but I have to run. Talk to you later.
 9462: Um, yeah... Just running some errands, that's all. Nothing to worry about. See you later.
 9463: Does it matter where I am? I'm kind of busy now, so I'll catch you later, okay?
 9464: Well, does it matter? I'm busy now! Gotta go!
 9465: I don't think that's any of your concern. I am busy now, so let's talk later.
 9466: Hm, why do you care, anyway? Hey, I'm busy, so I'll catch ya later, 'kay?
 9467: I am afraid that does not concern you. I am busy now, so let us talk later.
 9468: Do you presume to be my guardian? I have urgent matters to attend to. There will be time for chatter later.

 9485: Such foolish behavior for someone who's injurrred. <Player>, you should go make sure nothing bad happens again!
 9486: [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji]! You had me so worried! I'm so glad you'rrre safe!
 9487: [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde]! You had me so worried! I'm so glad you'rrre safe!
 9488: [Chanandit/Deulmaeux/Demresinaux/Ephealgaux/Gauldeval/Grauffemart/Migaifongut/Romidiant]! You had me so worried! I'm so glad you'rrre safe!
 9489: [Armittie/Cadepure/Clearite/Epilleve/Liabelle/Nauthima/Radille/Vimechue]! You had me so worried! I'm so glad you'rrre safe!
 9490: [Balu-Falu/Burg-Ladarg/Ehgo-Ryuhgo/Kolui-Pelui/Nokum-Akkum/Savul-Kivul/Vinja-Kanja/Yarga-Umiga]! You had me so worried! I'm so glad you'rrre safe!
 9491: [Cupapa/Jajuju/Kalokoko/Mahoyaya/Pakurara/Ripokeke/Yawawa/Yufafa]! You had me so worried! I'm so glad you'rrre safe!
 9492: [Fhig Lahrv/Khuma Tagyawhan/Pimy Kettihl/Raka Maimhov/Sahyu Banjyao/Sufhi Uchnouma/Tsuim Nhomango/Yoli Kohlpaka]! You had me so worried! I'm so glad you'rrre safe!
 9493: [Durib/Dzapiwa/Jugowa/Mugido/Voldai/Wagwei/Zayag/Zoldof]! You had me so worried! I'm so glad you'rrre safe!
 9494: But why did you go back to Qufim?
 9495: I wanted to test my own strength.
 9496: I wanted to see how much I could handle!
 9497: I wanted to test my strength.
 9498: I desired a test of my strength.
 9499: I just wanted to find out how strong I was.
 9500: I wanted to see what kind of mettle I was made of.
 9501: I wanted to test my own strength.
 9502: I wanted to see how strong I am!
 9503: I wanted to test my strength.
 9504: I wanted to see just how strong I am!
 9505: I desired a test of my strength.
 9506: I merely wished to test my limits.
 9507: I went to prove that I could defeat the monster on my own.
 9508: I went to show everyone that that monster stood no chance against me!
 9509: I went to prove that I could single-handedly defeat that monster.
 9510: I went to prove that I could defeat the monster alone.
 9511: I wanted to prove that I could defeat that monster by myself.
 9512: I wanted to prove to myself that I could defeat that monster alone.
 9513: I went to prove that I could defeat the monster by myself.
 9514: I went to show everyone that I could take that monster on myself!
 9515: I went to prove that I could bring the monster down alone.
 9516: I went to prove that I could defeat that monster by myself!
 9517: I went to prove that I could defeat the monster alone.
 9518: I looked upon defeating that monster as a personal challenge. That is why I went without you, <Player>.
 9519: I felt bad for always relying on <Player>...
 9520: I mean, I can't just always rely on <Player>, now, can I!?
 9521: I didn't want to keep relying on <Player>...
 9522: I felt that I should stop relying on <Player> for everything.
 9523: I wanted to become stronger, and more independent--like you, <Player>.
 9524: I appreciate you being there for me and everything, <Player>. But...I was beginning to lose confidence in myself.
 9525: I felt bad, because I always rely on <Player>...
 9526: I wanted to stop always relying on <Player>!
 9527: I didn't want to keep relying on <Player>...
 9528: I always rely on <Player> for everything, so I felt bad...
 9529: I felt that I should stop relying on <Player> for everything.
 9530: I felt myself growing much too dependent upon you, <Player>. I'm not familiar with being dependent.
 9531: So that's what happened... Pheauclemand's friend probably had a good reason, too.
 9532: Pheauclemand's friend?
 9533: Pheauclemand is the man who told me about the monsterrr in Qufim. A long time ago, he had a close friend, you see...
 9534: That sounds like Pembroke...
 9535: That must have been Pembroke!
 9536: Pembroke...
 9537: That sounds like Pembroke.
 9538: Are you talking about Pembroke?
 9539: That's Pembroke you're talking about, right?
 9540: That sounds like Pembroke!
 9541: That guy! His name is Pembroke!
 9542: The man you speak of is named Pembroke.
 9543: Oh! That must be Pembroke!
 9544: That sounds like Pembroke.
 9545: This person you speak of could only be Pembroke.
 9546: Pembroke?
 9547: I met him at the hospital after I got hurt.
 9548: I met that guy at the hospital when I was hurt!
 9549: I met him when I was in the hospital.
 9550: I met him at the hospital when I was injured.
 9551: I met him at the hospital when I was hurt.
 9552: The time I was hurt and in hospital--that's when I met him.
 9553: I met him when I was in the hospital!
 9554: I met him in the hospital after I got hurt!
 9555: I met him when I was in the hospital.
 9556: Yeah! I met him in the hospital after I got hurt!
 9557: I met him at the hospital when I was injured.
 9558: I met him during my time in hospital.
 9559: How fare you today?
 9560: Well then. Here is your medicine, now. Medicine alone will not cure you, though. You must walk outside a bit, refresh your senses.
 9561: I will see you later, then.
 9562: Doctor...
 9563: Ah, [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji]. You look much better now.
 9564: Ah, [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde]. You look much better now.
 9565: Ah, [Chanandit/Deulmaeux/Demresinaux/Ephealgaux/Gauldeval/Grauffemart/Migaifongut/Romidiant]. You look much better now.
 9566: Ah, [Armittie/Cadepure/Clearite/Epilleve/Liabelle/Nauthima/Radille/Vimechue]. You look much better now.
 9567: Ah, [Balu-Falu/Burg-Ladarg/Ehgo-Ryuhgo/Kolui-Pelui/Nokum-Akkum/Savul-Kivul/Vinja-Kanja/Yarga-Umiga]. You look much better now.
 9568: Ah, [Cupapa/Jajuju/Kalokoko/Mahoyaya/Pakurara/Ripokeke/Yawawa/Yufafa]. You look much better now.
 9569: Ah, [Fhig Lahrv/Khuma Tagyawhan/Pimy Kettihl/Raka Maimhov/Sahyu Banjyao/Sufhi Uchnouma/Tsuim Nhomango/Yoli Kohlpaka]. You look much better now.
 9570: Ah, [Durib/Dzapiwa/Jugowa/Mugido/Voldai/Wagwei/Zayag/Zoldof]. You look much better now.
 9571: Who was that, just now?
 9572: Hey! Who was that, just now?
 9573: Who was that?
 9574: Who was that, just now?
 9575: Who was that?
 9576: Who were you talking to just now, doc?
 9577: Who was that, just now?
 9578: Hey! Who was that, just now?
 9579: Who was that?
 9580: Hey! Who was that, just now?
 9581: Who was that, just now?
 9582: Who was that person?
 9583: Oh, you mean Pembroke? He is mute. Something terrible happened to him forty years ago, and he still has yet to recover.
 9584: Others have told me that he was attacked by a monster on Qufim Island and lost someone very important to him.
 9585: Ever since that time, he has not spoken a single word. I am sure that he will return to normal if the opportunity presents itself, but nothing has worked as of yet.
 9586: Come to think of it, Pembroke was an adventurer, just like you. I remember that he had a close friend, too, but decades have passed since then...
 9587: Maybe if his friend were here, he would regain the ability to speak. However, I do not even know his friend's name, let alone his whereabouts.
 9588: ...
 9589: What!? He can't speak anymorrre? I bet Pheauclemand doesn't know that!
 9590: Those two have been misunderstanding each other this whole time! <Player> and [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji], only you two can brrring them back together again!
 9591: Those two have been misunderstanding each other this whole time! <Player> and [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde], only you two can brrring them back together again!
 9592: Those two have been misunderstanding each other this whole time! <Player> and [Chanandit/Deulmaeux/Demresinaux/Ephealgaux/Gauldeval/Grauffemart/Migaifongut/Romidiant], only you two can brrring them back together again!
 9593: Those two have been misunderstanding each other this whole time! <Player> and [Armittie/Cadepure/Clearite/Epilleve/Liabelle/Nauthima/Radille/Vimechue], only you two can brrring them back together again!
 9594: Those two have been misunderstanding each other this whole time! <Player> and [Balu-Falu/Burg-Ladarg/Ehgo-Ryuhgo/Kolui-Pelui/Nokum-Akkum/Savul-Kivul/Vinja-Kanja/Yarga-Umiga], only you two can brrring them back together again!
 9595: Those two have been misunderstanding each other this whole time! <Player> and [Cupapa/Jajuju/Kalokoko/Mahoyaya/Pakurara/Ripokeke/Yawawa/Yufafa], only you two can brrring them back together again!
 9596: Those two have been misunderstanding each other this whole time! <Player> and [Fhig Lahrv/Khuma Tagyawhan/Pimy Kettihl/Raka Maimhov/Sahyu Banjyao/Sufhi Uchnouma/Tsuim Nhomango/Yoli Kohlpaka], only you two can brrring them back together again!
 9597: Those two have been misunderstanding each other this whole time! <Player> and [Durib/Dzapiwa/Jugowa/Mugido/Voldai/Wagwei/Zayag/Zoldof], only you two can brrring them back together again!
 9598: Pembroke is probably back at the hospital now. Let's go, <Player>!
 9599: I bet Pembroke is back at the hospital now! Come on, <Player>! Let's go!
 9600: Pembroke is probably back at the hospital now. Want to go, <Player>?
 9601: Most likely, Pembroke is back at the hospital now. Shall we go, <Player>?
 9602: Pembroke should be back at the hospital now, so let's go, <Player>.
 9603: Pembroke might be at the hospital now. Let's go check, <Player>.
 9604: Pembroke is probably back at the hospital now. Let's go, <Player>!
 9605: Hey, I bet Pembroke is back at the hospital now! Let's go, <Player>!
 9606: Pembroke is probably back at the hospital now. Shall we go, <Player>?
 9607: Do you think Pembroke's back at the hospital now? Let's go see, <Player>!
 9608: Most likely, Pembroke is at the hospital now. Shall we go, <Player>?
 9609: Chances are Pembroke is now back at the Hospital. <Player>! We're going!
 9610: I'll let Pheauclemand know. I hope everrrything goes well!
 9611: You found Pembroke's friend? Excellent!
 9612: Pembroke...is it really true that you have been mute all these years?
 9613: ...!
 9614: How can this be? All this time, and I never noticed...
 9615: Pembroke... I implore you, tell me! What happened on that fateful day?
 9616: ...
 9617: Pembroke, please try! He hurried here the moment he heard about you.
 9618: ...
 9619: So this is where that monster's been showing up! I'll defeat it myself and show Pheauclemand what I'm made of!
 9620: Tomorrow, I'll marry Pelagia. I've gotta prove that I'm fit to protect her myself!
 9621: Pembroke!
 9622: Pelagia!? What are you doing here!?
 9623: I heard that you came out here all alone, and I was worried...
 9624: Don't worry about me! It's dangerous here! Go back to town right now!
 9625: Eek!!!
 9626: Pelagia! Go hide!!!
 9627: Damn... I can't do this alone! This is not looking good!
 9628: Wait! Stay away from there!!!
 9629: Help me, Pembroke!!!
 9630: Pelagiaaa!!!
 9631: I...I...
 9632: You wanted to defeat the monster without relying on Pheauclemand...
 9633: Right? Pembroke...you were no different than I am now, were you?
 9634: Right? Pembroke...you were the same as me, weren't you?
 9635: Right? So, Pembroke...you were just like me, eh?
 9636: Is that not so? Pembroke... Truly, you were no different than I.
 9637: That's true, isn't it? You're just like me, Pembroke...
 9638: Right? I felt the same way you did, Pembroke.
 9639: Isn't that right? Pembroke...you were the same way I am now.
 9640: Isn't that right? Pembroke! You were just the way I am now!
 9641: Right? Pembroke...You and I are not so different.
 9642: Right, Pembroke? You were the same as I am now!
 9643: Is that not so? Pembroke... Truly, you were no different than I.
 9644: Am I not correct, Pembroke? We have something in common, you and I.
 9645: Pelagia... She...followed me... I'm so sorry...Pelagia...
 9646: If only...I hadn't...gone... If only...I were stronger...
 9647: Pembroke, you should stop blaming yourself.
 9648: Pembroke... I had no idea that you felt that way.
 9649: I always relied on you, too. You saved me countless times.
 9650: I cannot do much alone. I have realized that even more since we last parted.
 9651: Y-you're... You're right, Pheauclemand. I'm sorry...for putting you through all this.
 9652: Thank you. You have helped me release a great burden from my mind.
 9653: Pembroke and I will be friends again now, just as we were in our youth.
 9654: Right, Pembroke?
 9655: ...Yes, we will. I also...want to say thank you... I really appreciate it...
 9656: You know, I've been thinking. <Player>, have you ever needed me when I wasn't there to help?
 9657: Hey, you know, I've been thinking. <Player>, have you ever been in trouble when I wasn't there to save you?
 9658: <Player>? Have you ever needed me...when I wasn't there?
 9659: I have been thinking, <Player>. Have I ever failed you in a time of need?
 9660: There's something I want to know, <Player>. Do you ever have trouble when I'm not with you?
 9661: You know, I've been wondering. Have you ever felt insecure because I wasn't around?
 9662: Um...I've been thinking. <Player>, have you ever needed me when I wasn't there to help?
 9663: Hey, ummm...<Player>? Have you ever been in trouble because I wasn't there to save you?
 9664: <Player>? Have you ever needed me...when I wasn't there?
 9665: Um, <Player>...? I was wondering. Have you ever needed me when I wasn't there?
 9666: I have been thinking, <Player>. Have I ever failed you in a time of need?
 9667: Be frank with me, <Player>. Do you sometimes find it difficult without my presence?
 9668: Really? That's a relief.
 9669: Really? What a relief!
 9670: Oh? Glad to hear it.
 9671: Is that so? I am very happy to hear that.
 9672: Really? I'm happy to hear that.
 9673: Is that right? I really needed to hear that.
 9674: Oh, really? That's a relief.
 9675: Oh, what a relief!
 9676: Oh? I am glad to hear that.
 9677: Oh, really? I'm so happy!
 9678: Is that so? I am very happy to hear that.
 9679: Really...?
 9680: Like Pembroke, I thought I could do everything by myself.
 9681: I was acting like Pembroke, thinking I could do it all alone!
 9682: Like Pembroke, I thought I could go it alone.
 9683: Like Pembroke, I thought that I could do everything alone.
 9684: I thought that I could do it by myself. Just like Pembroke.
 9685: Like Pembroke, I wanted to know that I could handle things without any help.
 9686: Like Pembroke, I thought I could do it all myself.
 9687: I thought I could do it all alone! I was just like Pembroke!
 9688: Like Pembroke, I thought I could do everything myself.
 9689: I was just like Pembroke, thinking I could do everything by myself!
 9690: Like Pembroke, I thought that I could do everything alone.
 9691: Like Pembroke, I wished to reaffirm my independence.
 9692: But I was wrong. I need you, <Player>. I'm sorry for the way I acted. From now on, I won't try to go it alone!
 9693: But was I ever wrong! I'm sorry for pushing you around! I won't try to go it alone anymore!
 9694: ...But I was wrong. <Player>, I do need you. Sorry for everything. From now on, I will try to be more considerate.
 9695: However, my thinking was incorrect. I need you, <Player>. I apologize for my behavior. No longer will I attempt to go my own way.
 9696: But now I know better. I'm sorry I made you worried. We're a team, right, <Player>?
 9697: But I've been made to realize how important you are to me, <Player>. I'm sorry for the way I acted.
 9698: I was wrong, though. I need you, <Player>. I apologize for the way I acted. From now on, I won't try to go it alone.
 9699: But I was wrong! I do need you, <Player>! I'm really sorry for the way I acted! I won't try to go it alone anymore!
 9700: ...But I was wrong. I need you, <Player>. I apologize for everything. From now on, I won't try to go it alone.
 9701: I was so wrong! I do need you, <Player>! I'm really, really sorry for everything! I won't try to go it alone anymore!
 9702: However, my thinking was incorrect. I need you, <Player>. I apologize for my behavior. No longer will I attempt to go my own way.
 9703: But that was a mistake. My pride led me to act foolishly, and I am deeply regretful. There is much we can achieve together, <Player>.
 9704: Thanks to you, I feel like I can become even stronger now.
 9705: Thanks to you, I'm sure I can be even stronger now!
 9706: Thanks to you, I'll try to become even stronger now.
 9707: Thanks to you, I feel I can increase my strength as an adventurer.
 9708: With you, I feel like I can become a better adventurer.
 9709: Thanks to you, I feel as though I can grow stronger.
 9710: Thanks to you, I feel I can become even stronger now!
 9711: Thanks to you, I can become even stronger!
 9712: Thanks to you, I feel I can become even stronger.
 9713: As long as you're here with me, I bet I can get even stronger!
 9714: Thanks to you, I feel I can increase my strength as an adventurer.
 9715: Your presence spurs me on to achieve greater heights as an adventurer.
 9716: Your adventuring fellow's level limit is now 60.
 9717: Grrreat timing as always, <Player>. I have a favor to ask you.
 9718: Actually, I was going to ask [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji] to help as well... And here he is!
 9719: Actually, I was going to ask [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde] to help as well... And here she is!
 9720: Actually, I was going to ask [Chanandit/Deulmaeux/Demresinaux/Ephealgaux/Gauldeval/Grauffemart/Migaifongut/Romidiant] to help as well... And here he is!
 9721: Actually, I was going to ask [Armittie/Cadepure/Clearite/Epilleve/Liabelle/Nauthima/Radille/Vimechue] to help as well... And here she is!
 9722: Actually, I was going to ask [Balu-Falu/Burg-Ladarg/Ehgo-Ryuhgo/Kolui-Pelui/Nokum-Akkum/Savul-Kivul/Vinja-Kanja/Yarga-Umiga] to help as well... And here he is!

 9725: Actually, I was going to ask [Durib/Dzapiwa/Jugowa/Mugido/Voldai/Wagwei/Zayag/Zoldof] to help as well... And here he is!
 9726: I was just explaining to <Player> that I want you two to head to Windurst for me.
 9727: Sure. What do you need us to do?
 9728: No problem! What are we doing in Windurst?
 9729: Windurst? What do you need us to do there?
 9730: A trip to Windurst? And what are we to do when we get there?
 9731: Windurst? Sounds like fun! What do we do when we get there?
 9732: Windurst? That's fine with me, but what do we do when we get there?
 9733: Windurst, huh? What will we be doing there?
 9734: Windurst! Great! What do you need us to do?
 9735: Sure. And what lies in store for us there?
 9736: Oh, I love Windurst! What do you want us to do once we get there?
 9737: A trip to Windurst? And what are we to do when we get there?
 9738: I must admit to having a soft spot for Windurst. What is it that we are to do?
 9739: I knew I could count on your enthusiasm.
 9740: What I need you to do is borrow a book. As you probably know, the library in Windurst is home to many ancient tomes of lore.
 9741: I want you to bring me a book that contains a method for repairing the broken mirror you left with me.
 9742: You mean to repair the mirror? Is it possible to fix an enchanted object like that?
 9743: You're going to fix that mirror!? Do you really think it's possible?
 9744: So you want to fix that mirror? Will you be able to repair something with that kind of enchantment?
 9745: You mean to repair the mirror? Can you truly restore such an unusual object to its original state?
 9746: You want to fix the mirror? Is it possible to repair something like that?
 9747: Oh, you're planning to repair the mirror? Would it be possible to restore such a magical object?
 9748: You mean to repair the mirror? Is it possible to fix an enchanted object like that?
 9749: You're going to fix that mirror!? Do you really think it's possible?
 9750: So you want to fix that mirror? Will you be able to repair something with that kind of enchantment?
 9751: Why fix that one? Wouldn't it be easier just to buy a new mirror?
 9752: You mean to repair the mirror? Can you truly restore such an unusual object to its original state?
 9753: You wish to repair the mirror? Such an object will not be easily restored.
 9754: And what about the terrible powers it holds...? Why would you want to restore something like that...?
 9755: What about the terrible powers it holds...? Why would you want to restore something like that...?
 9756: And what about the terrible powers it holds...? Why would you want to restore something like that...?
 9757: And what about the terrible powers it holds...? Why would you want to restore something like that...?
 9758: And what about the terrible powers it holds...? Why would you want to restore something like that...?
 9759: And what about the terrible powers it holds...? Why would you want to restore something like that...?
 9760: And what about the terrible powers it holds...? Why would you want to restore something like that...?
 9761: And what about the terrible powers it holds...? Why would you want to restore something like that...?
 9762: And what about the terrible powers it holds...? Why would you want to restore something like that...?
 9763: And doesn't that thing have creepy powers...? Why would you want to restore something like that...?
 9764: And what about the terrible powers it holds...? Why would you want to restore something like that...?
 9765: And what about the terrible powers it holds...? Why would you want to restore something like that...?
 9766: <Sigh>... You just don't understand the potential.
 9767: That mirror is a treasure of the Near East. The price will rise exponentially if it's in mint condition.
 9768: It may be a frightful object, but that's just one more aspect that makes it valuable to collectors.
 9769: I see... Well, you're the expert...
 9770: I see... Well, you're the expert...
 9771: I see... I'm not convinced, but I guess I'll help you.
 9772: I see... Well, if you're adamant about this, I suppose I have no choice but to help you.
 9773: I'm not sure about this, but if you say so...
 9774: Hmmm... Well, I'm not one to argue.
 9775: I see... Well, you're the expert...
 9776: Hmm... Oh well, let's see what happens!
 9777: I can't say I agree with you, but I'll help you out.
 9778: Hmmm... Well, you're the expert, Luto!
 9779: I see... Well, if you're adamant about this, I suppose I have no choice but to help you.
 9780: Is that so...? I still have my doubts...but I'll help you.
 9781: The mirror is made with a rrrare, black-tinted metal. That should help start you on your search.
 9782: I want to hear every scrrrap of information you can dig up. Find out everything you can.

 9796: I knew I could count on you two! Let's dive rrright in, shall we?
 9797: So this tome is called the "Looking Glass Legends," and is written by..."Taliesin."
 9798: Apparently, another mirror exists that is the twin to the one described in this book.

 9810: Yes... I know...
 9811: You knew? About the Blighted Gloom, and the Blessed Radiance?
 9812: You knew? About the Blighted Gloom, and the Blessed Radiance?
 9813: You knew? About the Blighted Gloom, and the Blessed Radiance?
 9814: You knew? About the Blighted Gloom, and the Blessed Radiance?
 9815: You knew? About the Blighted Gloom, and the Blessed Radiance?
 9816: You knew? About the Blighted Gloom, and the Blessed Radiance?
 9817: You knew? About the Blighted Gloom, and the Blessed Radiance?
 9818: You knew? About the Blighted Gloom, and the Blessed Radiance?
 9819: You knew? About the Blighted Gloom, and the Blessed Radiance?
 9820: You knew? About the Blighted Gloom, and the Blessed Radiance?
 9821: You knew? About the Blighted Gloom, and the Blessed Radiance?
 9822: You knew? About the Blighted Gloom, and the Blessed Radiance?
 9823: Yes. One of the mirrors was being kept in the Empire of Aht Urhgan, but was eventually lost to the world. Or so the tale goes...
 9824: It was once stored within a small chest and strrrictly guarded, with only selected people permitted to view the mirror itself.
 9825: This looking glass supposedly emitted a light of such heart-stopping beauty, it was almost blinding.
 9826: This light was so dazzling, it spilled from the chest and soothed the souls of all who gazed upon it.
 9827: And so we can deduce from these properties that the mirror lost to the Aht Urhgan Empire was most likely the Glass of Blessed Radiance.
 9828: If this mirror still exists somewhere in the world, I would do anything to track it down!
 9829: I'm a sucker for beautiful artifacts. And this tale of divine rrradiance makes me want it even more!
 9830: ...This book appears to be of considerable age. You did well to discover such a valuable resource.
 9831: Let's see what it has to say.
 9832: "Worshipped in the Near East, there is a small mirror whose creation was ordered by a king, now long deceased."
 9833: "As time passed, the looking glass came to be revered as a holy object, and even while it was kept under guard..."
 9834: "...people began to call it the Mirror of Blighted Gloom."
 9835: "The blackened metal of the mirror emits a dim, dark light that conjures images of early evening."
 9836: Hmmm...
 9837: That would suggest to me that the brrroken glass I have now is this Mirror of Blighted Gloom. The description fits perfectly.
 9838: The explanation continues...
 9839: "This metal is like no other substance we have ever encountered."
 9840: "Expert scientists concur that while this substance gives off a metallic glint..."
 9841: "...it has a malleable structure at room temperature almost like a liquid. However, for reasons unknown, it is able to maintain its shape."
 9842: "The metal used by the creators of the mirror no longer exists, and as such, it would be impossible to duplicate its creation today."
 9843: No longer exists...! Then how am I supposed to...?
 9844: What else does it say?
 9845: What else does it say?
 9846: What else does it say?
 9847: Does it say anything further?
 9848: Is that all it says?
 9849: Doesn't it say anything else?
 9850: What else does it say?
 9851: What else does it say?
 9852: What else does it say?
 9853: Is that all it says?
 9854: Does it say anything further?
 9855: Is there more to the passage?
 9856: It continues...
 9857: "However, the method for crafting the mirror has been discovered and follows these steps:"
 9858: "One. Prepare the metal that is to become the body of the mirror."
 9859: "Two. Find a spring with a surface as smooth as glass. The spring must be filled with clear water."
 9860: "Three. Chant the charm, and offer a prayer. The charm is only known by the guardians of the mirror..."
 9861: "If the above steps are followed correctly, an enchanted mirror will be created."
 9862: This is no help at all! Why tell us all this when there is no way to know the charm?
 9863: What do we do? Is there anything we can do?
 9864: Who are these guardians of the mirror...?
 9865: Just a moment, Luto. The Glass of All-Seeing...
 9866: Just a moment, Luto. The Glass of All-Seeing...
 9867: Just a moment, Luto. The Glass of All-Seeing...
 9868: One moment, Luto. The Glass of All-Seeing...
 9869: Just a moment, Luto. The Glass of All-Seeing...
 9870: Just a moment, Luto. The Glass of All-Seeing...
 9871: Just a moment, Luto. The Glass of All-Seeing...
 9872: Just a moment, Luto. The Glass of All-Seeing...
 9873: Just a moment, Luto. The Glass of All-Seeing...
 9874: Just a moment, Luto. The Glass of All-Seeing...
 9875: One moment, Luto. The Glass of All-Seeing...
 9876: Just a moment, Luto. The Glass of All-Seeing...
 9877: Palometa...!
 9878: Palometa...!
 9879: Palometa...!
 9880: Palometa...!
 9881: Palometa...!
 9882: Palometa...!
 9883: Palometa...!
 9884: Palometa...!
 9885: Palometa...!
 9886: Palometa...!
 9887: Palometa...!
 9888: Palometa...!
 9889: The mirror shows her near the airship docks.
 9890: The mirror shows her near the airship docks.
 9891: The mirror shows her near the airship docks...
 9892: The mirror shows her near the airship docks.

 9900: The mirror shows her near the airship docks.
 9901: The little girl you found in the Eldieme Necropolis? Well, pinch my whiskers.
 9902: We have to go and talk to her! She could be our only clue!
 9903: We have to find Palometa. She could be our only clue...
 9904: You feel the bonds between you and your adventuring fellow strengthen!

 9913: I think your pal is looking for a new one again. If the weapons I hand over don't make an impression, they don't get used, it seems.
 9914: What's happening to the weapons that don't get used? I don't know, but I certainly hope your gifts aren't being sold off!
 9915: If you still wish to pass on weapons or shields thrrrough me, I'll be glad to help.
 9916: <Player>, have you met with [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji] lately? It appears he's rrreally coming along as an adventurer.

 9924: I thought a new weapon or shield would make a nice gift in thanks for all the hard work your frrriend has done for me.
 9925: But then I rrrealized I have absolutely no idea when it comes to weapons. Do you think you could find something suitable for me?
 9926: Then it would be like a prrresent from the both of us! Wouldn't that be nice?
 9927: <Player>, the weapon that [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji] is using is not the one that I gave him...
 9928: <Player>, the weapon that [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde] is using is not the one that I gave her...
 9929: <Player>, the weapon that [Chanandit/Deulmaeux/Demresinaux/Ephealgaux/Gauldeval/Grauffemart/Migaifongut/Romidiant] is using is not the one that I gave him...

 9934: <Player>, the weapon that [Durib/Dzapiwa/Jugowa/Mugido/Voldai/Wagwei/Zayag/Zoldof] is using is not the one that I gave him...
 9935: Was there something wrong with my gift!? I think I'm insulted!
 9936: Wasn't that a prrresent from the both of us, you ask? Well, I had meant to explain that when I handed over the gift...
 9937: I'll be sure to mention it next time! Well? What are you waiting for? We need to find a weapon that won't be rrrejected!
 9938: I'm glad you've come, <Player>. I think I've found a metal we can use to rrrestore the mirror.
 9939: Apparently, this substance was discovered through research intended to find an alternative base for the Mirror of Blighted Gloom.
 9940: This may be exactly what we're looking for.
 9941: Since we have no other leads, I prrropose we give this metal a shot.
 9942: "Looking Glass Legends" calls this substance "$3." Fascinating stuff...
 9943: Poor little Palometa has been exhausted by all this excitement...
 9944: I hope that knowing the location of the mirror has eased her anxiety a little. Right now, she's rrresting at an inn with her mother looking over her.
 9945: But you know...
 9946: There were a lot of things written in "Looking Glass Legends" that we were not aware of.
 9947: What kind of things?
 9948: What kind of things?
 9949: What kind of things?
 9950: Such as?
 9951: What kind of things?
 9952: What kind of things?
 9953: What kind of things?
 9954: What kind of things?
 9955: What do you mean?
 9956: Like what?
 9957: Such as?
 9958: For example?
 9959: It seems that the Mirror of Blighted Gloom has powers beyond what we already know.
 9960: If what the book says is true, the value of the mirror will multiply beyond belief!
 9961: Powers beyond the strength it gives to monsters?
 9962: What powers could it have beyond the strength it gives to monsters?
 9963: Powers beyond the strength it imparts to monsters?
 9964: Powers beyond the strength it imparts to monsters?
 9965: It can do even more than give power to monsters?
 9966: Something else besides powering-up monsters?
 9967: Powers beyond the strength it imparts to monsters?
 9968: What powers could it have beyond the strength it gives to monsters?
 9969: Powers beyond the strength it imparts to monsters?
 9970: Powers besides making monsters really strong?
 9971: Powers beyond the strength it imparts to monsters?
 9972: Powers beyond the unnatural strength it imbues in monsters?
 9973: I'll rrread to you what Taliesin, the author of this book, has to say.
 9974: "Within this mirror lies the power I have sought for so long..."
 9975: "No, it does not reside within the mirror itself. Rather, the glass exists as a conduit to channel power..."
 9976: "The Mirror of Blighted Gloom was created by researchers following the orders of a king."
 9977: "The tale begins in an ancient age..."
 9978: "The king of a certain nation feared the might of his neighbors, and determined that his kingdom required an unparalleled power..."
 9979: "The Mirror of Blighted Gloom is what emerged from the researchers' efforts with their nation's unique metal."
 9980: "The energy channeled by the mirror in but a single moment was said to have been so tremendously powerful that an entire city could be destroyed."
 9981: "The damage inflicted on the kingdom by this uncontrollable energy was so devastating that it was only ever used once."
 9982: "Whether due to this untamable energy, or some other reason we are not aware of..."
 9983: "...the kingdom responsible for the mirror's creation has vanished from the face of Vana'diel. Not a name--not a single trace--remains in the memory of people."
 9984: "The descendants of that kingdom now lived without a country to call home. Perhaps they needed some link to the past."
 9985: "The mirror became this link, and in time came to be worshipped as a divine artifact..."
 9986: "It can be reasoned that these descendants must have sensed a presence within the mirror that exceeded the world of men."
 9987: "Their instincts were correct."
 9988: "For the Mirror of Blighted Gloom has the power I have sought, a power not easily obtained... The power to channel the energy of the Dark Divinity..."
 9989: ...
 9990: At least, that's how he tells it.
 9991: The Dark Divinity...? Could this be true?
 9992: The Dark Divinity...? Are you sure this guy's not making up stories?
 9993: Channeling the power of the Dark Divinity? Seems a little far-fetched.
 9994: The Dark Divinity? Could this tale be true?
 9995: The Dark Divinity? What a scary sounding name...
 9996: The D-D-Dark Divinity!? If this is a joke, it isn't funny.
 9997: The Dark Divinity...? Could this be true?
 9998: The Dark Divinity...? Are you sure this guy's not making up stories?
 9999: Dark Divinity? Sounds like a child's bedtime story.
10000: The Dark Divinity? Brrr...gives me the shivers.
10001: The Dark Divinity? Could this tale be true?
10002: The Dark Divinity? This is rather difficult to swallow.
10003: I had trouble believing the tale myself. Only...
10004: We've seen the Mirror of Blighted Gloom with our own eyes, and we have no way of refuting his claims about its other powers.
10005: Is it true? Is it all a lie? We'll never know unless we trrry to fix the looking glass.
10006: If the mirror can truly channel the power of this Dark Divinity, then one thing is certain: this is the rrrarest treasure I'll ever have the pleasure of gazing upon.
10007: That may be so, but isn't it too dangerous?
10008: That may be so, but don't you think it's a little dangerous?
10009: That may be so, but isn't it too dangerous?
10010: That may be so, but have you considered the dangers?
10011: But...are you sure this won't be too dangerous?
10012: That's all well and good, but are you sure we should meddle in something this dangerous?
10013: That may be so, but isn't it too dangerous?
10014: That may be so, but don't you think it's a little dangerous?
10015: That may be so, but think of the danger.
10016: But isn't this really dangerous?
10017: That may be so, but have you considered the dangers?
10018: But no matter its worth, the mirror conceals a danger far beyond our comprehension.
10019: Danger-smanger. If I spent my whole life worrying about consequences I wouldn't be much of a treasure hunter, now, would I?
10020: And I can't just stand around doing nothing when I think of little Palometa.
10021: We have to repair the mirror for her sake.
10022: I don't agree with this course of action, but we did promise Palometa...
10023: You're right! Let's do it!
10024: You could be right...
10025: Well, it seems we have little choice in the matter. I was responsible for breaking the mirror in the first place, after all.
10026: That's true...
10027: Yeah, we can't forget our promise. Besides, there's nothing I wouldn't do for our little lady!
10028: I suppose you're right.
10029: Okay. Let's do it!
10030: If you put it like that...
10031: You're right! For Palometa!
10032: Well, it seems we have little choice in the matter. I was responsible for breaking the mirror in the first place, after all.
10033: Hmmm... Considering the mirror was broken by my own hands, I guess this discussion is settled.
10034: Grrreat! Our first step will be to obtain the $3. I'm sure you and <Player> will have no problems.
10035: The book says the metal can be found in the body of an extremely rare slime.
10036: In the time that "Looking Glass Legends" was written, this slime supposedly lived in the Korroloka Tunnel.
10037: In the time that "Looking Glass Legends" was written, this slime supposedly lived in Ordelle's Caves.
10038: In the time that "Looking Glass Legends" was written, this slime supposedly lived in Ranguemont Pass.
10039: 3 is a very malleable substance, so take care how you handle it.
10040: Meanwhile, I'll go rrretrieve the mirror and we can meet back here.
10041: Phew. That [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji] is a stubborn one.
10042: Phew. That [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde] is a stubborn one.
10043: Phew. That [Chanandit/Deulmaeux/Demresinaux/Ephealgaux/Gauldeval/Grauffemart/Migaifongut/Romidiant] is a stubborn one.
10044: Phew. That [Armittie/Cadepure/Clearite/Epilleve/Liabelle/Nauthima/Radille/Vimechue] is a stubborn one.
10045: Phew. That [Balu-Falu/Burg-Ladarg/Ehgo-Ryuhgo/Kolui-Pelui/Nokum-Akkum/Savul-Kivul/Vinja-Kanja/Yarga-Umiga] is a stubborn one.
10046: Phew. That [Cupapa/Jajuju/Kalokoko/Mahoyaya/Pakurara/Ripokeke/Yawawa/Yufafa] is a stubborn one.
10047: Phew. That [Fhig Lahrv/Khuma Tagyawhan/Pimy Kettihl/Raka Maimhov/Sahyu Banjyao/Sufhi Uchnouma/Tsuim Nhomango/Yoli Kohlpaka] is a stubborn one.
10048: Phew. That [Durib/Dzapiwa/Jugowa/Mugido/Voldai/Wagwei/Zayag/Zoldof] is a stubborn one.
10049: Persuading adventurers to go against their instincts is going to turn me into a nervous wrrreck. But all's well that ends well.
10050: The Dark Divinity...
10051: I wonder if Palometa knows anything about that. Guess I'll just have to ask her...
10052: Welcome back. I'm guessing my mighty adventurers were successful?
10053: Let's see the frrruit of your labors!
10054: I'm pretty sure this is the $3. Such a weird substance.
10055: This has gotta be your $3. I've never seen a metal like it..
10056: Here's your $3. Strangest metal I've ever seen...
10057: Your $3, as requested. A most unusual substance.
10058: This is the $3 you wanted, right? It's really...strange.
10059: I trust this is the $3 you asked for. This is unlike any metal I've seen before.
10060: Here's your $3, Luto. Such a strange substance.
10061: Did somebody order some $3? The goop is still fresh!
10062: This must be your $3. Strangest metal I've ever seen...
10063: Here's your $3, Luto! Ew, there's still some goop on it...
10064: Your $3, as requested. A most unusual substance.
10065: Here's your $3, as requested. Of all the strange things I've seen in life, this substance ranks highly.
10066: Yes, this is the material described in "Looking Glass Legends." I just hope it will work as a substitute...
10067: The next thing we need to find is a "spring with a surface as smooth as glass." One that's filled with prrristine water...
10068: Lakes close to the source of water are usually pretty clear...
10069: I guess we'll just have to check every place that fits the description.
10070: Luto!
10071: Oh? Little Palometa. How are you feeling, kiddo?
10072: Great! I had a really long sleep, so I feel much better!
10073: [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji]! I'm so glad you're okay!
10074: [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde]! I'm so glad you're okay!
10075: [Chanandit/Deulmaeux/Demresinaux/Ephealgaux/Gauldeval/Grauffemart/Migaifongut/Romidiant]! I'm so glad you're okay!

10080: [Durib/Dzapiwa/Jugowa/Mugido/Voldai/Wagwei/Zayag/Zoldof]! I'm so glad you're okay!
10081: I heard from Luto that you were going off to fight some terrible slime monster! You must be really strong!
10082: Just your average adventurer...
10083: Heh heh. I think Luto's been stretching the facts.
10084: Just doing my job...
10085: Well, let's not get carried away...
10086: N-no, not at all.
10087: Haha, I wish! Well, maybe just a little.
10088: No more than any other adventurer...
10089: Well, I wouldn't say "really strong"...
10090: Just doing my job...
10091: Oh, you say the sweetest things...!
10092: Well, let's not get carried away...
10093: Nothing to brag about.
10094: Are you blushing, [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji]?
10095: Are you blushing, [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde]?

10101: Are you blushing, [Durib/Dzapiwa/Jugowa/Mugido/Voldai/Wagwei/Zayag/Zoldof]?
10102: Oh yeah! That "Dark Divinity" you were asking me about at the inn... I remembered something that might be important.
10103: Oh? You had a think about it like I asked you?
10104: So tell us, what did you rrremember?
10105: There's a story that my daddy used to tell me.
10106: It's the only one I can think of where the word "dark" seemed really important.
10107: Let's hear this story then, sweetie.
10108: Okay. Now, how did it go...?
10109: Once there was a meeting of two great masses.
10110: One, an entity of "dark." One, an entity of "light."
10111: Their collision gave birth to a violent storm.
10112: The storm rose towards the heavens, and burst into a million fragments.
10113: One shard of the storm glittered in the sky. One shard of the storm shone below the earth.
10114: And thus we pray. To hold both shards within our hands...
10115: I think that's how my daddy told it.
10116: You tell it very well, dear. I wonder...
10117: What's on your mind, Luto?
10118: What is it, Luto?
10119: Let's hear it, Luto.
10120: Have you figured something out, Luto?
10121: Did you think of something, Luto?
10122: What is it, Luto?
10123: What is it, Luto?
10124: You look like you know something. Come on, spill it.
10125: Let's hear it, Luto.
10126: What? What do you wonder?
10127: Have you figured something out, Luto?
10128: Did something come to mind?
10129: The "dark" and the "light"...
10130: These words could be used to descrrribe the two mirrors...
10131: Two mirrors...!?
10132: Oho, nothing for you to worry your little head about. The Glass of Blessed Radiance is lost and out of the equation for the moment.
10133: We need to focus on rrrepairing the mirror we have.
10134: Now where could this lake...spring...whatever...be located?
10135: Once we find the rrright body of water, everything will be ready.
10136: 3 is a malleable metal. I need you to bring me a sample.
10137: Once we find this spring of clear water, our prrreparations will be complete.
10138: Palometa still hasn't opened her eyes. I wish I knew how to help her...
10139: Fine. Hand over the $1 and the $2 and we'll forget any of this ever happened.
10140: Hand over the $1 and the $2 and we'll forget any of this ever happened. Are you certain you want to go through with this?
10141: <Player>, have you come to ask about Palometa?
10142: She still hasn't woken up...
10143: Hehe. Can't seem to keep you two aparrrt.
10144: It's your pal [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji].
10145: It's your pal [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde].

10176: Not so good.
10177: After returning to Jeuno, I took her strrraight to the doctor...
10178: There is nothing medically wrong with her. She appears to be under the influence of a curse.
10179: As far as my knowledge extends into this field, this type of curse can only be removed by the one who placed it... You must track down this person and have him or her remove the affliction.
10180: Is there no other way?
10181: There is but one more method for removing the curse...
10182: Just one? And what would that entail?
10183: The death of the cursemaker.
10184: No matter which path you decide upon, if you do not remove the curse, this little girl will remain in slumber indefinitely.
10185: So you see our prrredicament.
10186: Where could that awful man be...?
10187: The Glass of All-Seeing has been unstable ever since that incident in Jugner Forest.

10209: I do not believe we can rely on its seeking powers to locate that villain.
10210: We cannot rely on its seeking powers to locate that villain.
10211: If I hadn't been so focused on rrrepairing the mirror, I might have saved her...
10212: I've been so foolish.
10213: It's not your fault, Luto.
10214: Don't beat yourself up over it, Luto.
10215: It's not your fault, Luto.
10216: You mustn't blame yourself, Luto.
10217: It's okay, Luto.
10218: Don't be so hard on yourself, Luto.
10219: It's not your fault, Luto.
10220: It's not your fault, Luto.
10221: No one could have predicted that would happen, Luto.
10222: You can't blame yourself, Luto.
10223: You mustn't blame yourself, Luto.
10224: Blaming yourself will not help Palometa. What's done is done.
10225: That man dropped it before he fled. You should hold on to it.

10236: That man dropped it before he fled. You should hold on to it.
10237: ...?

10251: ...Thank you.
10252: Palometa is rrresting at the Neptune's Spire in Lower Jeuno. Would you mind checking up on her?
10253: Hmmm...
10254: Time for a visit to the Optistery. Let's see what I can dig up on the Glass of All-Seeing...
10255: Thank Altana, you're here!
10256: Palometa's been abducted. I trrried to follow them, but I couldn't keep up...
10257: Laurana is sick with worry and exhaustion. All we could do was wait for your rrreturn.

10282: Why would he take Palometa away...?
10283: I thought he was only after the Mirror of Blighted Gloom?

10377: Wow! Rrreally!? And the curse was lifted?
10378: That's wonderful news! I'm so rrrelieved to hear that the mirror is back with its rightful owner.
10379: I never thought I would be able to gaze upon these two incrrredible objects.
10380: Their incalculable worth... Their otherworldly powers...
10381: Such magnificent trrreasures.
10382: (That's what's important when bargaining with those people...<mumble...mumble>...)
10383: (I guess this is not rrreally the time for dwelling on consequences...)

10628: Don't get too down about it, though. It's prrrobably just my imagination.

10754: ...And that's the rrreason you were asked to cut back on the $1 communications.
10755: I'm sorry to have kept the truth from you, <Player>, but I wanted it to be a surprise.
10756: So, that's the truth behind all of this. I hope you can forgive my little white lie.
10757: Hope you don't hold it against me...
10758: I hope that you can forgive my little deception.
10759: I'm sorry for lying to you. I just wanted to make the gift for you as soon as possible.

10789: After what you did to <Player>, I don't think you deserve it.
10790: I don't think so. You gave up that right when you sent <Player> into danger.
10791: I think I'll take it back, actually. You could have gotten <Player> killed.
10792: After what you put <Player> through!? I've changed my mind...
10793: Actually, I think I'll have it back. You could have gotten <Player> seriously injured, or even killed!
10794: Did I say that? Well, after what you did to <Player>, I think I'll be taking it back.
10795: I'm not giving you that pearl after what you did to <Player>!
10796: I suppose I did. But considering the danger you put <Player> in, I think I've changed my mind.
10797: After what you did to <Player>? You blew it, Luto!
10798: I think I'll take it back, actually. You could have gotten <Player> killed.
10799: I never go back on a promise, but circumstance calls. You grossly disregarded <Player>'s safety and welfare. So no, you may not keep the pearl.
10800: What!? So I went through all this trrrouble for nothing!?
10801: I found the recipe you needed, and a place to practice in prrrivate!
10802: After everything I've done for you...!
10803: Well, compared to all the work I've done for you...
10804: How about I buy you dinner sometime, instead...?
10805: Serves you right.
10806: (Speaking of working for nothing...)
10807: No, no, no. You have to learn your lesson!
10808: Hey, don't go mixing issues now. Don't do anything like that ever again.
10809: Well, compared to all the work I've done for you...
10810: I'm sorry, but my decision is final!
10811: I'm sorry, but my mind is made up.
10812: What a cheek! Have you forgotten all the times I've helped you out for nothing but a smile, Luto!?
10813: (Speaking of working for nothing...)
10814: If we were to compare favors granted, I believe you'd come up rather short.

10844: Really? Phew! I'm going to keep trying and make something even better next time. You'll see, <Player>!
10845: That's really encouraging! I was worried whether you liked it or not. What should I try making next, I wonder... Until then, <Player>.
10846: Really? I'm so glad. Maybe I can make something different the next time. Until then.
10847: Great! There's lots of other things I'm dying to try! See you around, <Player>!
10848: I'm so glad. I'm hoping to try my hand at something different next time. Until then.
10849: Really? Yay! I'll make something even better next time! Until then, <Player>!
10850: You truly like it? Well, that's a relief. I shall try my hand at something different next time. Until then.
10851: Is that so? That's good to hear. I shall try something different next time. Until then.

10883: I apologize, but it seems that you cannot visit the Isle yet. I have nothing to say to you.
10884: There is something I must tell the adventurers of Jeuno! If you could just give me a bit of your time...
10885: Listen to what he has to say? [Sure./Not now.]
10886: Well then, you must come back when you have more time!
10887: I believe this is our first meeting.
10888: I am Afdeen, pupil of the great Abdhaljs before even Tillecoe. A pleasure to make your acquaintance.
10889: There is a reason why I am here. Allow me to explain...
10890: An interesting idea was proposed at the last Conquest Evaluation Assembly...
10891: ...And so it seems that the adventurers are using their own unique set of rules for Ballista.
10892: There is also the remarkable news that the most capable adventurers in the world came together for a tournament that encompassed the greater part of Vana'diel.
10893: Ballista has been taken out of our hands and placed into those of the adventurers.
10894: I agree. The Ballista participants have forced us to recall the true meaning of the word "hero."
10895: The revival of Ballista has raised morale and restored public order. I suppose we have achieved our original goals.
10896: ...We have, have we?
10897: It certainly sounds like someone's a mite bitter...
10898: Volker can't just mumble and grumble at Destin's baby boy. If you want an explanation, then stop being coy!
10899: You have to charge in! Be frank and direct. That's the only way to get the response you expect!
10900: What did you just call me!?
10901: Stop quarreling! It is my fault for mumbling to myself. Please listen to what I have to say.
10902: I agree that the San d'Orian Royal Knights are endowed with sound, quick decision-making abilities and deserve admiration.
10903: The deeds of a single hero are capable of setting afire the hearts of many a soldier. We must not neglect the power of motivation in leading an army to victory.
10904: Even so, soldiers must be able to follow their commander's orders and fulfill their given roles. Arbitrary decisions can lead an entire army to its doom.
10905: Thus, I am of the opinion that observing Ballista matches in their current state may not be a beneficial practice for our armies.
10906: Your remarks are inexcusable! How dare you denounce a San d'Orian tradition! I suggest you reconsider your statements.
10907: I apologize. I must admit that Ballista has noticeably improved the skills of many an adventurer and educated our soldiers on the importance of courage.
10908: However, the reality is that our armies are divided into several units, each with its own role. The soldiers must be able to coordinate themselves effectively and behave as a whole. I believe that a new form of Conflict that trains participants to work in a group would be most rewarding.
10909: Harumph, do we look like children to you? You could have cut that explanation in half and it would have been more than sufficientaru!
10910: All right then. I'll get straight to the point now.
10911: Oh, give us a break! What point could you make? All your vague statements and whatnot! Why not lend an ear to what I've got?
10912: No thanks... Well then, I shall be frank.
10913: I propose the reinstatement of "Brenner" as a new form of Conflict!
10914: Brenner!?
10915: I remember that name. Before the Great War, Brenner was used in the selection of the Gold Musketeers. However, the competition was extraordinarily fierce, and it is said that the casualties always exceeded the number of successful candidates.
10916: Those stories were fabricated simply to exaggerate the danger of Brenner.
10917: Brenner was originally created as a training exercise for mineworkers. The outcome of each match relied on the participants' skill in role management and encouraged team competition.
10918: Of course, I am not suggesting that we abolish Ballista. I simply advise that we add Brenner to the list of training options in order to supply the elements of teamwork that I find lacking in current matches.
10919: Hmph, so you wish to fortify your army by tying them tightly together in iron bonds. How very-wery Bastokan!
10920: Ohohoho! Still, the idea makes my heart race! I even support it. You make a good case!
10921: Ohohoho! So if your weaklings unite, you think you can win any fight?
10922: Oho, this is rich! May your plan go without hitch!
10923: I will support your plan, but please be aware that against the black mages, no one's got a prayer!
10924: If it will supplement Ballista, I believe that even Excenmille would have no argument. You have my approval.
10925: I appreciate your decision. Now I also would like to suggest that we do away with the license requirement and nationality restrictions for Brenner.
10926: Quite a bold statement. However, teams would be composed of complete strangers if we enforce what you propose. Is that your desire?
10927: The adventurers have taught me much, but one of the greatest lessons I have learned is the strength of the bond between linkshell members.
10928: Linkshells provide an exemplary model of unity. The cooperation and friendly competition of these groups are like those of the closest companions or even family. And thus, I propose that we introduce matches divided by linkshell rather than nation.
10929: Interesting. You seem to have worked out these plans more thoroughly than I expected. Have you also given consideration to where the matches will be held?
10930: Of course. Wolfgang, shall we invite our guest in now?
10931: A pleasure to make your acquaintance. I am called Afdeen.
10932: I have come to your lands by order of the great Abdhaljs.
10933: By Altana! Do you mean to suggest that you are a direct disciple of Sir Abdhaljs? I believe I have heard your name before.
10934: Is your master in good health? He deserves our gratitude for the Diorama...
10935: Yes, he is quite well. However, he desires no reward. He is quite pleased with the Ballista matches that take place each day in the Diorama.
10936: On another note, he has expressed interest in a new form of Conflict. He has entrusted me with matters regarding his new diorama, which is designed after Purgonorgo Isle.
10937: The great Abdhaljs has created a new diorama specifically for this new form of Conflict? Magnificent! You will hear no argument from me.
10938: That's dandy-wandy, but don't forget that Windurst won't lend a single gil to the project!
10939: Well, there you have it. The preparations sound fine! Okay then, inform me when Windurst is next in line!
10940: The reinstatement of Brenner has now been approved!
10941: I will send a detailed explanation of the rules to each of you. If you should have any objections, please take them up with Sir Wolfgang.
10942: Obviously, the citizens of Windurst have the closestaru bond. Our adventurers will have to teach the rest of you a thing or two about teamwork now.
10943: I am simply beside myself--my prayers will not cease! Wishing your people get through this in one piece! Ohohoho`!
10944: I will not stand for these meaningless insults against the Royal Knights! Our records in Ballista prove our prowess in working as a team.
10945: I think it is time to call this meeting to a close. Thank you all for your participation.
10946: How can any idea be interesting when Bastok thoughtaru of it first?
10947: You're missing the point--this'll make them prepared for the time that they're needed, my plans unimpaired!
10948: Your plans? You can't mean...
10949: Now to just wait and see what Brenner will bring to me!
10950: I'll need many a strong adventurer for my grand plans, that's for sure! Ohohoho!
10951: Sending Ajido-Marujido to the assembly had results most intriguing. They actually helped me save time for my scheming!
10952: And time waits for no man! But lucky me--I'm a woman! Ohohohoho!
10953: ...And that, roughly, is how Brenner was reinstated.
10954: I will guide participants to Abdhaljs Isle-Purgonorgo as the great master requested. Please let me know if you are interested.
10955: I am Afdeen, pupil of the great and honorable mage Abdhaljs. I have been assigned with the management of his spectacular creation--Abdhaljs Isle-Purgonorgo.

11076: Congratulations on taking the top spot! But the other linkshells are not going to give you a moment's rest. Accept their challenges and prove your team to be the best in Vana'diel!
11077: Ranking results will take a moment to display. Please wait.
11078: I apologize, but I was unable to update the results.
11079: I cannot register your record because it is not recent enough.
11080: I am sorry, but you did not rank high enough to display on the results list. Please try again!
11081: You have given me $1 gil.
11082: I am afraid you do not have enough gil.
11083: You may participate in LS Liga as the leader of one linkshell at a time, and must pay a registration fee of $0 gil.
11084: You can change the linkshell that you have registered for a fee of $1 gil, but no other costs will be incurred.
11085: What will you do? [Register for LS Liga./I changed my mind.]
11086: Your linkshell, "%0," is now registered for LS Liga!
11087: I am sorry, but I was unable to process your registration for LS Liga.
11088: A fee of $0 gil is required to change your registered linkshell. In addition, all of your previous LS Liga records will be erased.
11089: What will you do? [Change linkshells./I changed my mind.]
11090: Your linkshell ("%0") registration settings have been changed.
11091: I am sorry, but I was unable to process the changes.
11092: "LS Liga" is a type of Brenner match in which linkshell groups compete against each other. Each leader can have only one linkshell registered at a time.
11093: To participate in LS Liga, select "linkshell" under the "entry type" category.
11094: The Herald will lead you through the necessary procedures.
11095: A record is kept of the outcome of the linkshell leader's most recent $0 matches.
11096: Victories earned by lighting all Flammen-Brenner will award the linkshell with $0 [point/points]. All other wins are worth $1 [point/points], and draws are worth $2 [point/points]. Each member's personal Brenner record will also be calculated in the result.
11097: However, repeated matches with the same linkshell members during a single reservation period will be counted as training matches, and will not be recorded. Matches won against a team whose number of victories differs from yours by a substantial amount ($0 wins) will also be treated likewise.
11098: The linkshell leader's participation in the match is required, but other members may join or leave as they wish. The leader may also participate in other LS Liga matches as the member of a different linkshell.
11099: You begin participating in the LS Liga ranking system the moment the leader registers your linkshell. LS Liga ranking lists registered linkshells in order of match score.
11100: Still, the ranking system is not a tournament. There are no rewards.
11101: Instead, we would like you to think of it as a way of advertising your linkshell. That would make the great Abdhaljs most pleased.
11102: Please be aware that ranking information resets after a certain period of time.
11103: Hello there, [mister/miss]! Would you happen to be an "adventurer"?
11104: 'Fess up. [Yes...why?/Definitely not!]
11105: Splendid! You must wear this, [mister/miss]!
11106: No? Well, I think this would look splendid on you anyway!
11107: Ajithaam tacks a $3 on you!
11108: This badge is made to resemble the head of a wildcat, the mark of the prestigious mercenary company "Salaheem's Sentinels." Beautiful, isn't it?
11109: Our company is also authorized by the empress of Aht Urhgan. Does not that alone make your heart race?
11110: It doesn't? Well, if you change your mind, we are currently recruiting. Be sure to let everyone know!
11111: The number of people interested in our company seems to be gradually increasing. Or could it simply be my imagination?
11112: I have something to tell you that may be of use. The $3 was created using advanced alchemy techniques. It contains a device that makes the eyes of the wildcat glimmer when somebody catches a glimpse of it.
11113: Thanks to you, I have had to deal with huge lines of Jeunoans looking for information on Salaheem's Sentinels!
11114: Okay, that was an untruth...but honestly, people are talking about our company. I suppose that means I will be able to keep my job. Thank you for your fantastic work!
11115: The wildcat on your $3 seems drained of its energy. It must be restored now, so if you please...
11116: <Player> hands over the $3.
11117: You can have this instead. When you join our company, you will learn of its use. That will be something to look forward to...
11118: You obtain $6.
11119: When you go to the town of "Al Zahbi," give my regards to everyone at Salaheem's Sentinels! And remind them to be polite, because Ajithaam here is going to be in a top position someday!
11120: <Player>'s badge flashes brightly.
11121: Huff...puff... I'm trying to buildy-wuild some muscle so I can join the Ducal Guards, but whew! This is a lotta work!
11122: Puff...huff... Mercenaries fight on the very fwont lines, so I bet they hafta be weaaally tough! Their twaining must be even worse!
11123: I'm a little surprised that there are so many adventurers in our nation who are set on becoming mercenaries.
11124: Have they forgotten the pain and fear they went through in the last war?
11125: Heheh, I just can't rrresist anything shiny...
11126: Luto Mewrilah's badge flashes brightly.
11127: Still, I wonder why they've come all the way here to recruit mercenaries. I bet their expenses are through the rrroof!
11128: Rumors of the archduke's approval of the mercenary recruiters have increased people's trust. Perhaps that's why there are so many applications for the Salaheem's Sentinels--despite its location far across the Gugru Blue.
11129: Maybe if I become famous there as a Jeunoan, the archduke would invite me to meet him and honor me as the pride of his people!
11130: The people of Aht Urhgan do not worship Altana. Instead, they offer their prayers to a heathen deity. Such a vile practice.
11131: Still, the light of the Goddess shines upon all without favor. I am sure that someday they will also come to know Altana's compassion.
11132: Hey, what're you starin' at? Haven't ya ever seen a chocobo before?
11133: Chocobos may be tame creatures now, but they originally came from the wild.
11134: La Theine was once covered in wild chocobos. Flocks of 'em used to dart about the plains.
11135: That's why they love it when you take 'em back there. It runs through their blood.
11136: Kweh!
11137: Looks like it's feedin' time.
11138: It looks like the chocobo wants to venture outside town...
11139: Sneak the chocobo outside? [Free the chocobo!/No. Think of Brutus!]
11140: Kweh...
11141: Whew, these chocobos always act like they're starving...
11142: ...What's this?
11143: One of the chocobos is gone! I never thought I'd see the day!
11144: Could he have understood what we were talking about earlier?
11145: That chocobo always was a smart one. I wouldn't be surprised if he did understand, and went off in search of his wild companions...
11146: But wild chocobos don't exist anymore.
11147: That chocobo was raised in a stable. He doesn't realize how harsh the world out there is! What if he were attacked by some despicable creature?
11148: Please help me bring him back!
11149: The chocobo that escaped probably headed for La Theine... Good luck finding him.
11150: Thanks for bringing the chocobo back.
11151: He's been acting a bit strange ever since returning, though.
11152: He used to be so responsive to commands, but lately he's become rather stubborn. It's not a good influence on the other chocobos.
11153: I wonder what happened at La Theine...
11154: So it is happening even here...
11155: Hm? You're from San d'Oria, aren't you? So the chocobos are acting strangely there too?
11156: That is correct, sir. Something appears to be stirring among the chocobos... We must call the Vana'diel Chocobo Society into session immediately.
11157: I shall rally the members from the nations of Vana'diel myself. As soon as you have made your preparations, please make haste to the chocobo stables in San d'Oria.
11158: What a mess...
11159: Sorry, but I think you should also attend the session. You're the one who last saw the chocobo before the change...
11160: Kweh!!!
11161: What a travesty...
11162: Is this how chocobos would behave without our intervention?
11163: I apologize for the delay.
11164: Kweh!
11165: Kweh!
11166: Kweh!!!
11167: Kweh!!!
11168: Could these chocobos already know each other!?
11169: <Player>, what is the meaning of this?
11170: I see... So the two met on the La Theine Plateau, each believing they had met a wild chocobo...
11171: They had us all worked up over nothing...
11172: Kweh...
11173: Kweeeh...
11174: Kweh!
11175: Kweeeht
11176: Looks like they're already doing better. Chocobos are really somethin', aren't they?
11177: They're much cuter like this.
11178: Thanks to you, the chocobo stables are doing better than ever before. You adventurers are doin' a great job... I've never seen such fine-lookin' animals!
11179: Here's a little token of my gratitude. I'm sure you can raise a winner!
11180: It's thanks to you that the chocobo stables are still thriving.
11181: I'm going to have another talk with the VCS about everything that has happened. Come back later and I'll tell you how it went.
11182: Great timing, <Player>! I have something good to tell you! The Vana'diel Chocobo Society made a big decision...
11183: Thanks to <Player>, the chocobos' behavior has returned to normal.
11184: In all probability, we will require the aid of the adventurers in other matters from now on.
11185: And thus, I would like to propose that we allow adventurers to participate in chocobo raising.
11186: Adventurers!?
11187: Raising chocobos!?
11188: Now there's an idea...
11189: I am confident that one such as <Player> could raise a fine chocobo! What say you?
11190: Well then, by unanimous consent, I now approve adventurers to take part in chocobo raising!
11191: Session adjourned!
11192: ...And that's how it went. Letting adventurers participate should really liven things up around the chocobo stables!
11193: I'll let this be your first one. Bring it to a stable and I'm sure ya can raise 'er to be a fine chocobo.
11194: Be sure to give your chocobo lots of loving care. When it comes down to it, that's what's most important.
11195: I'm Finbarr, the chocoguy!
11196: Thanks!
11197: The chick hasn't been born yet...
11198: A chick was born!
11199: You obtain $1!
11200: Hello there! Your chocobo should be fully grown in no time!
11201: This week's schedule: [Minimum care (no charge)./Emphasis on exercise (1200 gil)./Physical training (1300 gil)./Rest (1500 gil)./Ask about current condition./Ask for a care report./Never mind.]
11202: All you want for your chocobo this week is the minimum level of care? There is no charge for this service, but it will not help your chocobo grow...
11203: An emphasis on exercise, is it? Your chocobo will run and build leg strength with this program.
11204: Physical training, is it? Your chocobo will spend time exploring outside and digging with this program. It should help your animal build a strong beak and claws.
11205: Giving your chocobo a rest will allow it to recover from accumulated fatigue and restore a great deal of energy.
11206: Choose this program? [Yes./No.]
11207: Understood. Your chocobo is in good hands with us this week.
11208: Changed your mind? When you decide on a program, please let me know. If there is no word from you, we will continue to give your chocobo the minimum level of care.
11209: You seem to be raising your chocobo well.
11210: It does not seem to have any serious illness or sudden changes in temperament. Everything looks to be in perfect order.
11211: All that you have been providing for your chocobo is the minimum level of care. As a result...
11212: Your chocobo's legs are a bit stronger than average...
11213: But its overall physical strength is a bit lower than average.
11214: Come back any time. Your chocobo is counting on you!

11259: Your chocobo is hopelessly spoiled! You should discipline it some.
11260: Your chocobo ran away from the stables the moment I turned my back... It must have been upset about something. All we can do is wait for it to come back now.
11261: Your chocobo seems to have its head in the clouds lately... It must be in love. Not sure what to do about that...
11262: Your chocobo has been making a real fuss at night lately. Such behavior is common for chicks, but you should deal with it as soon as possible.

11342: Telling your chocobo a story will help it develop a healthy psychological state. Remember that concentrating on your speech will have a slightly tiring effect on the animal, though.
11343: When your chocobo acts stubborn, you must discipline it. Remember that reproof is an act of love. It is important to scold your chocobo the moment it acts up!
11344: You're interested in entering your chocobo into competitions? Strange...there were three others who mentioned the same thing. Well, it is good for their physical development, after all. I suppose it's alright as long as it's done peacefully.
11345: Venturing outside of town with your chocobo will improve the bond between the two of you. If you don't wander off too far, your chocobo should not get very tired, either.
11346: Venturing outside of town with your chocobo will improve the bond between the two of you. You should try wandering out just a bit sometimes. It might tire your chocobo a bit, but could have some positive effects as well.
11347: Venturing outside of town with your chocobo will improve the bond between the two of you. Wandering far from town on a walk will expose your chocobo to all sorts of new experiences!
11348: Your chocobo already has a name.
11349: Choose a word category ([first name/last name]). [1-letter words."-letter words."-letter words./4-letter words./5-letter words./6-letter words./7-letter words./8-letter words./9-letter words./10-letter words./11-letter words./12-letter words./13-letter words./14-letter words./Return./Cancel.]
11350: Is this name okay? [%0 %1? Yes!/On second thought...]
11351: That name is currently unavailable. Please try another combination.
11352: Choose a word.(%0) [$0/$1/$2/$3/$4/$5/$6/$7/$8/$9/$10/$11/$12/$13/$14/$15/$16/$17/$18/$19/$20/$21/$22/$23/$24/$25/$26/$27/$28/$29/Cancel./View other options.]
11353: F(A=
11354: $0
11355: I can issue you a card that contains all your chocobo's important information.
11356: If you trade the card to the chocobo matchmaking authority in Jeuno, you can match up your animal with other chocobos. You can buy a chococard for $0 gil.
11357: Purchase a chococard? ($0 gil each) [Yes./Not now.]
11358: To enter your chocobo in one of the CRA-sanctioned races, you must first receive $0.
11359: Then, simply trade that document to a CRA agent to complete the registration process.
11360: Would you like a free form? [Right away!/Maybe later.]
11361: You can register a chocobo to respond to your call in the field. The chocobo will come to you when you use your $0.
11362: Your chocobo's registered data determines certain features, such as its saddle, so it is wise to re-register from time to time.
11363: You can register a retired chocobo by trading $0 to me.
11364: However, I will require a small fee.
11365: Register a chocobo? ($0 gil) [Yes./Not now.]
11366: I shall make the necessary preparations, then.
11367: I will now register %0 to come when you call.
11368: I require $0 gil for preparations.
11369: I shall ready your chocobo, then.
11370: You lost your $0? Of all the irresponsible...
11371: Anyway, I can give you a new $0, but you're going to have to pay $1 gil for it.
11372: Purchase $0? ($1 gil) [Yes./Not now.]
11373: Hm... This seems to be in great condition! We shouldn't need to do any work on it at the moment.
11374: Hm... This $2's power to call your chocobo seems to have grown weak...
11375: For a small fee, I can give you a new $2 in exchange for it if you wish.
11376: Pay for a new whistle? ($1 gil) [Yes, please./Not yet.]
11377: Here you go. Take good care of it.
11378: All right... You can have this back, then.
11379: I cannot accept a fee from you this time. The $0 is all I require.
11380: Here, take this.
11381: Are you sure that you want to stop caring for this chocobo?
11382: Stop caring for your chocobo? [Yes./No!]
11383: You will never be able to see your chocobo again. Is that okay with you?
11384: Understood. Care of your chocobo will transfer to the stables. Do you have any last words?
11385: What would you like to say? [Nothing./I'm sorry./It's just an animal!/We weren't compatible./Take good care of it.]
11386: Is that so? I guess this is hard on you too, then. Sorry...
11387: Is that so? That's a good attitude to have...
11388: ... I'm disappointed in you.
11389: I don't think it's a matter of compatibility. A chocobo is not a toy!
11390: We will. I'm sure you have your reasons, but it's still no excuse.
11391: Of course not! Whew, you had me frightened for a second there! Don't say such things!
11392: You really want to retire your chocobo?
11393: Retire your chocobo? [Yes./Not yet!]
11394: Once you retire your chocobo, you won't be able to meet it anytime you want anymore. Are you okay with that?
11395: Understood. We hope you enjoyed raising your chocobo.
11396: Of course not! Such a decision cannot be made in haste!
11397: Your chocobo learns Gallop!
11398: Your chocobo learns Canter!
11399: Your chocobo learns Burrow!
11400: Your chocobo learns Bore!
11401: Your chocobo learns Auto-Regen!
11402: Your chocobo learns Treasure Finder!
11403: I'm afraid we still aren't finished using the $0, so I will have to return your item to you.
11404: You give the $0 to the chocobo.
11405: The chocobo looks like it's already full, but it's forcing itself to eat...
11406: Your chocobo is sleeping soundly. You cannot feed it now.
11407: Your chocobo has run away. You cannot feed it now.
11408: You cannot feed a chocobo that has not hatched yet.
11409: It seems like it will have some sort of effect on the chocobo...
11410: Let me know if you have any questions about chocobo raising.
11411: What would you like to ask about? [The Vana'diel Chocobo Society./Time required./Chocobo attributes./Care schedule./Caring for your chocobo./Feed./Abilities and personality./Retirement./Matchmaking./Calling chocobos in the field./Items./Lost chicks./Nothing.]
11412: Just let me know if you ever get curious!
11413: The Vana'diel Chocobo Society, or VCS for short, is an international organization designed to train and dispatch chocogirls and chocoguys to stables across Vana'diel.
11414: They provide courses on practical chocobo riding and the proper ways to care for a chocobo, as well as working to improve the treatment of chocobos from here to Aht Urhgan.
11415: Anyone can join as long as they love chocobos. The VCS will help you with anything you need.
11416: Chicks hatch from eggs, grow into young chocobos, and finally mature.
11417: They grow much faster than people do. Usually it takes about 1 month (Earth time) before you can ride your chocobo.
11418: The chocobo's traits are determined by the way in which you care for your animal. Without proper planning, you won't be able to raise the type of chocobo that you want.
11419: But don't worry, because you have us to help! We're all in this together!
11420: Ask about which attribute? [Strength./Endurance./Discernment./Receptivity./Energy./Affection./Satisfaction./Nothing.]
11421: "Strength" is a term used to describe the chocobo's leg power. The more strength a chocobo has, the faster it will be able to run. Rental chocobos have been raised with an emphasis on this attribute.
11422: Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as "Physical attributes."
11423: "Endurance" is a term used to describe the chocobo's stamina. If your chocobo has high endurance, you will be able to ride it for a long period of time.
11424: Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as "Physical attributes."
11425: "Discernment" is a must for anyone who wants their chocobo to learn new abilities. You may want to consider raising this attribute if you are interested in digging for treasure.
11426: Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as "Mental attributes."
11427: "Receptivity" is a term used to describe the chocobo's sensitivity when dealing with others. You can foster receptivity in your chocobo by giving it lots of opportunities to communicate with other chocobos.
11428: Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as "Mental attributes."
11429: "Energy" is a term used to describe the amount of power the chocobo needs to stay active for the day. If your chocobo has a lot of energy, care plans are more likely to be successful and you can provide more direct care for your chocobo.
11430: You can restore your chocobo's energy by feeding it, so remember not to skip out on feeding time after a demanding schedule!
11431: "Affection" is the most important attribute of all. Your care schedule will fall flat if you don't show your chocobo proper affection!
11432: You can raise your chocobo's affection by feeding it greens and caring for it on a regular basis.
11433: If you really want to raise your chocobo's affection quickly, you can give it $0, but I can't recommend doing so unless absolutely necessary.
11434: "Satisfaction" is a term used to describe how full or hungry your chocobo is. If your chocobo is full, it will gain a lot of energy before the next day.
11435: However, when the chocobo is very hungry, its energy will hardly recover at all and its affection will rapidly decrease.
11436: What would you like to ask about? [What is a care schedule?/Basic care./Resting./Taking a walk./Listening to music./Exercising alone./Exercising in a group./Interacting with children./Interacting with chocobos./Carrying packages./Exhibiting to the public./Delivering messages./Digging for treasure./Acting in a play./Nothing.]
11437: A care schedule is a series of plans that you set up for your chocobo so that we can take care of it while you are away.
11438: How you want us to care for your chocobo each day is completely up to you.
11439: You can register up to four plans at once, each for up to 7 days (Earth time).
11440: When you come to check on your chocobo, we will give you a report on the results. You should listen closely to the report and use it as reference when deciding on a new schedule.
11441: With the basic care plan, we will provide the minimum level of care for your chocobo. This plan is the most stable, and your chocobo will probably not experience any sudden changes.
11442: The basic care plan is good for those who don't want their chocobo's traits to change much or are still unsure of what kind of schedule to choose.
11443: You can select the basic care plan the moment you start raising your chocobo.
11444: The rest plan's name speaks for itself. We will give your chocobo a rest in order to restore its energy and cure any status abnormalities.
11445: However, your chocobo will not be able to eat any food you give it during the plan, because it will be in a deep sleep.
11446: We can take your chocobo for a walk in town to improve its physical attributes of strength and endurance. However, it will have a negative effect on its mental attributes of discernment and receptivity.
11447: Listening to music will improve your chocobo's mental attributes of discernment and receptivity. However, it will have a negative effect on its physical attributes of strength and endurance.
11448: Exercising alone will significantly improve your chocobo's strength. On the other hand, its mental attributes will markedly decrease.
11449: If the chocobo is strong, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo is weak, then you shouldn't push it too hard.
11450: Exercising with chocobos will build your animal's endurance. On the other hand, its mental attributes will decrease.
11451: If the chocobo has high endurance, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo's endurance is low, then you shouldn't push it too hard.
11452: Interacting with children helps your chocobo become a more discerning creature by interacting with people.
11453: However, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes, as no strenuous exercise is involved.
11454: If the chocobo has good discernment, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good discernment, then you shouldn't push it too hard.
11455: Interacting with other chocobos in the field will improve the chocobo's receptivity by fostering its communication skills.
11456: But because the focus is on communication and not exercise, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes.
11457: If the chocobo has good receptivity, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good receptivity, then you shouldn't push it too hard.
11458: You can choose to have your chocobo help deliver packages. Not only will this improve its physical attributes, but you will even receive payment for your services!
11459: The downside is that your chocobo's mental attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo, or you might find yourself getting cold treatment.
11460: You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public, which will allow anyone visiting the chocobo stables to take a look at your animal. Being the center of attention will help improve your chocobo's mental attributes.
11461: The downside is that your chocobo's physical attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo afterwards. Also, you will receive payment for this service.
11462: You can choose to have your chocobo deliver official messages for the nation. Not only will this improve its strength, but you will even receive payment for your services!
11463: However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.
11464: You can have your chocobo help out VCS finances by digging for treasure. This will also improve the chocobo's discernment.
11465: The VCS will sell the item and use the money for the organization's benefit, but will provide you with payment for your services.
11466: However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.
11467: You can choose to have your chocobo act as an extra in a play to improve its receptivity.
11468: You will receive payment in accordance with the chocobo's performance. However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.
11469: What would you like to ask about? [A general explanation./Watching over your chocobo./Telling a story./Scolding./Competing./Taking a walk./Nothing.]
11470: In addition to setting the chocobo's schedule, you can also care directly for your chocobo whenever you like.
11471: Caring for your chocobo will increase its affection for you.
11472: On the other hand, a chocobo that receives too much care will lose energy more rapidly when engaging in activities. If you do nothing but care for your chocobo, it will become fatigued.
11473: However, not caring enough for your chocobo will have a negative effect on your relationship, so it is important to find a balance.
11474: You can watch over your chocobo whenever you like.
11475: Your fond gaze can communicate even more than a touch and will not have a very tiring effect on the animal.
11476: You can tell the chocobo a story you know. This will foster the animal's sensibilities.
11477: I've heard that by listening to the story, the chocobo might even realize it has powers it never noticed before. (I've never seen it happen before, though...)
11478: Sometimes your chocobo might start acting spoiled or refuse to do anything but sleep. In such times, you will need to firmly scold it.
11479: This will shame the animal and have an effect on its receptivity.
11480: Competing against other chocobos will cultivate your animal's ambitious spirit and is highly effective for bored chocobos.
11481: You can take your chocobo out for a walk in the field. You will be able to choose more destinations as your chocobo grows.
11482: I like to take the chocobo out often, too, but I'm sure it prefers going out with you.
11483: Leaving the stables every once in a while allows your chocobo to experience new sights and sounds. Maybe you'll even discover something new together!
11484: What would you like to know about? [Why feeding is important./Vegetables./Wildgrasses./Carrots./Worms./Medicines./Pastes./Nothing.]
11485: Chocobos digest feed quickly, so they are often hungry.
11486: However, they also restore energy at a rapid pace. If you do not feed your chocobo properly, it will be unable to restore enough energy.
11487: The chocobo stables will provide your chocobo with the minimum amount of feed required for the animal to survive, but you need to provide more in order to ensure its healthy growth.
11488: At the same time, feeding your chocobo too much can result in a stomachache. Remember to strike a balance with both the variety and quantity of feed you give to your animal!
11489: Some types of feed have special effects, so it is important not to neglect your chocobo's diet if you want to raise a good chocobo.
11490: There are different methods of acquiring these special types of feed, so be on the lookout for them!
11491: Just trade the feed to an advanced chocobo trainer, and they will give it to your chocobo.
11492: This is the standard variety of chocobo feed, among which $0 are most popular.
11493: Chocobos also seem to enjoy $0 and $1.
11494: These greens are the most effective in satisfying a chocobo's hunger. Chocobos also enjoy the taste, which raises affection for their owner.
11495: Wildgrasses are a type of medicinal herb. They do not taste very good, but are highly effective at curing status abnormalities.
11496: $0, for example, works well on wounds. So although they look similar to $1, the effects are different.
11497: In addition, $0 is effective for illness, and $1 for a stomachache. It's a good idea to remember which herb to use in each situation.
11498: Carrots are high in nutrition, and will have an effect on the chocobo's strength and discernment.
11499: %, for example, affect the chocobo's physical attributes, and $1 are good for its mental attributes. $2 are in a category of their own.
11500: Remember, though, that the results are very slight, and keeping a good care schedule is a far more efficient way to alter your chocobo's attributes.
11501: Using worms as feed can have a variety of effects. They might look disgusting, but their effectiveness is not to be ignored!
11502: For example, $0 will dramatically increase your chocobo's affection, and $1 will restore its energy.
11503: But watch out for the side effects... Give the chocobo a worm at the wrong time, and all your effort could come to nothing...
11504: The most curious of all the worms is the $0. At first it may not seem to have any effect, but looks are deceiving...
11505: Medicines can cure a chocobo in the blink of an eye.
11506: $0 will restore your chocobo's energy in full, making it easier to care for and ensuring that the care schedule goes smoothly.
11507: % are effective for most status abnormalities, restoring instant health to your chocobo. Of course, you still need to continue caring for your chocobo so it can fully recover.
11508: A potion can also help fill a chocobo's stomach, so they can be useful when you are short on feed.
11509: Feed can be ground into paste for chicks to eat.
11510: You can make paste yourself with some cooking skill. If you don't have enough cooking skill yourself, then you might want to ask a friend to make some for you.
11511: Chicks can also eat regular feed, though.
11512: Which would you like to ask about? [Abilities./Temperament./Weather preferences./Nothing.]
11513: Your chocobo may learn useful abilities during the course of its life at the stables.
11514: For example, Auto-Regen will increase the rate at which your chocobo restores energy. Such an ability is sure to come in handy in a variety of situations.
11515: Your chocobo learns abilities by listening to your words, so if you know of any story that you think might interest the animal, you should tell it often.
11516: But remember, your chocobo can't learn all of the abilities there are. It can only learn two...or at least, that's what I read.
11517: The chocobo's temperament is determined when it is just a chick. Its temperament and attributes are somehow related, but I'm not really sure how.
11518: Chocobos generally like sunny days, but they could grow to like other kinds of weather depending on how they are raised.
11519: Chocobos pay attention to the air outside when they go on walks, and grow to prefer that type of weather because of the memories.
11520: Make the animal's schedule around its preferred weather days, and plans are more likely to succeed. However, if the chocobo has a favored type of weather, it also dislikes certain conditions, creating a weak point to watch for.
11521: You can choose to retire your chocobo at any time after it has fully matured.
11522: After retirement, the VCS will take up caring for the chocobo where you left off, so you need not worry about its welfare.
11523: When your chocobo retires, you will receive $0. Be sure not to lose it.
11524: You can use the $0 to register your chocobo to call in the field or for matchmaking purposes after retirement. All you need to do is trade it to a VCS member.
11525: The empty stall created after your animal retires can be used for raising other chocobos, so if you happen to come across another egg, you can bring it here to start all over again!
11526: When your chocobo is mature enough, you can breed it with another chocobo. If the chocobo lays an egg, the chick will inherit the traits of its parents.
11527: You will need $0 and $1 if you want to breed your chocobo. Apparently, you also need some kind of ticket that they sell at the stables in Upper Jeuno.
11528: You can ask one of the VCS members to issue you a chococard, or if your chocobo is already retired, just trade them $0.
11529: I don't really know that much about it, but you should probably try matching your chocobo up with several different animals and seeing what the results are.
11530: When your chocobo is mature enough, you can call it in the field using $0.
11531: You need to let a member of the VCS know which chocobo you want to respond to your call, because they must choose a saddle that fits your chocobo's attributes.
11532: That also means that when your chocobo's attributes change or it learns a new ability, you should probably let the VCS member know, too.
11533: When you want to register a retired chocobo to respond to your call in the field, trade $0 to a VCS member.
11534: Also, the $0's power will grow weak after you've used it several times.
11535: If this happens, just trade it to a VCS member and they will give you a new one for a fee.
11536: What would you like to ask about? [%./Chococards./$1./Nothing.]
11537: $0 proves that you are your chocobo's caretaker.
11538: With this card, you can register a retired chocobo to respond to your call in the field or get a chococard for matchmaking.
11539: If you lose it, you won't be able to get another one, so keep it in a safe place!
11540: You can use $0 to call your chocobo in the field to use as a mount.
11541: The more you use it, the weaker it will get, so eventually you will need to exchange it to a VCS member for a new one.
11542: Only people who have been approved by the VCS President can get $0, so good luck with that...
11543: Chococards are documents that contain all the details about a chocobo's attributes and condition. They are divided into two types--one for each gender.
11544: If you trade one to the person who's in charge of matchmaking, he'll introduce your animal to another chocobo.
11545: Chococards contain information on the chocobo's attributes and condition at the time the card is issued, so be sure to get a new card before using this service or the match will be arranged based on out-of-date information.
11546: If you want a chococard for a retired chocobo, then you must trade $0 to a VCS member.

11717: ...So, dam A's chick would inherit the sire's blue color and fancy plumage, but dam B's chick would not...
11718: But...B's chick's chick...would you call it B's grandchick? Anyway, the grandchick might just inherit the blue color? Man... All this pedigree stuff is so complicated.
11719: My boss is entrusting me with all the chocobo matchmaking work, so I'm trying to study about inherited traits as much as I can each day.
11720: But I think that there's so much more to this work than worrying about pedigree all the time.
11721: For example...the chocobos' compatibility and the timing play a part, too... There's so much to it, it's amazing!
11722: Actually... That's just what my boss told me.
11723: Anyway, I'm busy thinking of date plans for the chocobos to get to know each other better. Brilliant idea, huh?
11724: I spent so much time observing people dating, my plans should be failproof!
11725: I'm selling tickets for my date plans. If you want one, just let me know.
11726: So you want to buy a date plan for your chocobo, right? Which one do you want?
11727: Which ticket do you want? ($0 gil each) [None./Gourmet plan./Sports plan./Hiking plan./Jeuno Tour plan.]
11728: With this plan, the chocobos can enjoy fine dining together. Good food gives the chocobos strength, and increases chances that a male chick will be born. Would you like to choose this plan?
11729: With this plan, the chocobos can enjoy a vigorous exercise program together. This increases the chance that a chick with high endurance will be born. Competition also raises the possibility that the male chocobo's traits will be inherited. Would you like to choose this plan?
11730: With this plan, the chocobos can enjoy the sights and sounds of nature together. The fresh air will have a beneficial effect on your chocobo's intelligence, and increase the chance that a female chick will be born. Would you like to choose this plan?
11731: With this plan, the chocobos will get a tour of the Jeunoan streets led by yours truly. Seeing new sights will improve the chances of a highly receptive chick being born. Another of this date's features is the increased possibility that the female's traits will be inherited. Would you like to choose this plan?
11732: Purchase this ticket? [Yes./No thanks.]
11733: <Player> obtains $0!
11734: When you're ready, trade your ticket and both of the chocobo's chococards to me.
11735: The gourmet plan, is it? Nice choice. Let's give these chocobos some time together, now!
11736: They're back. Thanks to the taste of the delicious rolanberry, it looks like a beautiful friendship has been born.
11737: The way things are looking, we'll probably have a new egg tomorrow! I can't wait to see it!
11738: The sports plan, is it? Nice choice. Let's give these chocobos some time together, now!
11739: They're back. They seemed to be impressed by each other's speed. It looks like a beautiful friendship has been born.
11740: The hiking plan, is it? Nice choice. Let's give these chocobos some time together, now!
11741: They're back. They seemed to enjoy spending the time together. It looks like a beautiful friendship has been born.
11742: The Jeuno tour plan, is it? Nice choice. Let's give these chocobos some time together, now!
11743: They're back. Thanks to my help, it looks like a beautiful friendship has been born.
11744: ...So the chick of a sire of that coloring and a mother of this coloring would be...
11745: Oh, you want to know about the egg? I wonder if it'll hatch soon...
11746: The chocobo laid an egg! Take good care of it, now!

11751: You see a single, ivory venture roll die on the table. There are currently $0/$1 other players wishing to participate.
11752: What would you like to do? [Join table ($2 gil)./Leave./Read manual.]
11753: There are currently $0/$8 players at the table. Please wait a moment until the remaining participants have arrived. (You may still leave the table at any time.)
11754: You place $6 gil in the pot.
11755: The final participant has arrived. Your group is allowed $8 [minute/minutes] at the table.
11756: %0's primary roll is $0!
11757: Double up? (Currently: $0) [Yes./No.]
11758: <Player> doubles up... Your venture roll total is now $0!
11759: <Player> doubles up... BUST!!!
11760: %0 holds fast.
11761: Double up complete.
11762: Results...
11763: %0's final total is $0!
11764: %0 has gone BUST!
11765: The game has ended in a draw!
11766: The winner is %0!
11767: Someone has dropped the die down the drain! You can no longer continue playing.
11768: The final place at the table has already been taken.
11769: You do not have enough gil.
11770: Someone has dropped the die!
11771: Read which chapter? [1. "The Heart of Venture Roll."". "Rules of the Roll."". "Putting the Book Down."]
11772: Venture roll is a competitive game played with dice similar to those used by corsairs. The objective is to roll until your cumulative total comes as close to 11 as possible without going over.
11773: Until you reach or go over 11, you may continue rolling (doubling up) as many times as the table time limit allows ($8 [minute/minutes], Earth time).
11774: In addition to doubling up, you may also decline to roll the dice and stay with your current total (hold fast).
11775: If your total ever goes over 11, you will automatically lose the game, regardless of the totals of other players. Knowing the right time to hold fast is one of the keys to staying in the match.
11776: Once all the players have held fast, the game is over and the results are announced. The player closest to 11 is declared the winner and receives all the gil in the pot (the original participation fees of all the players).
11777: Objective: Roll a six-sided die as many times as necessary to achieve a total as close to 11 as possible. You lose the instant your total exceeds 11.
11778: If two or more players are the closest to 11 at the end of a match, the game is considered a draw and all participation fees are repaid in full.
11779: Once the game has started, fees will not be refunded for any reason unless the match results in a draw.
11780: Ah, my favorite customer! I've been hoping you'd walk through my door.
11781: Doesn't this ring belong to you?
11782: I remembered it because of the pretty blon...ah, I mean, the peculiar shape.
11783: Hm? Beautiful? Oh yes, she was quite attractive...
11784: Oh! The ring! Yes, exquisite!
11785: You must have dropped it right outside the tavern--I found it lying on one of the drains at the bottom of the stairs.
11786: You're lucky it got caught in the grille. One good storm and it would've been washed out to sea!
11787: Ah, yes!
11788: It just so happens that I have yet to return the remaining rings. Which means I have all three rattling in my hand here.
11789: Sooo... (The one you dropped is still in fine shape, now's your chance to choose a different one!)
11790: What's your poison? [I-I'm not ready.../Choose a ring.]
11791: I know, I know. It's a difficult choice to make.
11792: I tell you what; I'll be happy to look after them until you're ready to make a decision. Please come again any time!
11793: You seem distraught, [sir/madame]... You've gone and dropped it again, haven't you?
11794: And it just so happens that I found another ring lying in the exact same place.
11795: The thing is, though...
11796: It rolled away when I tried to pick it up. I'm not sure if it was yours or not.
11797: Although, the look on your face tells me...
11798: Hm? The other rings?
11799: Now, now, let's not be greedy, [sir/madame].
11800: I made a promise to a customer--you can't ask me to break my word.
11801: Who would then trust the owner of the Marble Bridge!?
11802: You must wait $1 [day/days] Vana'diel time ($2 [day/days] Earth time) until you are once again eligible to obtain the ring.
11803: What would ye be wantin' with me?
11804: And I don't want t'hear any nonsense about yer desire t'be a dancer in Troupe Brilioth.
11805: Do you want to be a dancer? [I surely do./No, I have two left feet.]
11806: Wonderful. Try not t'trip over yeself on the way out.
11807: <Sigh>...not another one.
11808: Listen here. I've handpicked ev'ry member of Troupe Brilioth for reasons o' style an' grace.
11809: This is no meltin' pot o' entertainment like a certain Troupe Valeriano.
11810: I can't be lettin' in ev'ry heavy-footed Galka and rhythmless Hume that walks in me door. If it's dancin' lessons ye want, go ask yer auntie.
11811: Give up? [Guess I'll go visit Auntie.../Never!]
11812: Ye're a stubborn [lad/lass], t'be sure. I'll tell ye what. If ye can bring me $6, I'll rethink me stance.
11813: And what kind o' rock is that, ye ask? Well, that's fer ye t'find out.
11814: If ye can bring me $6, I'll rethink me stance on lettin' ye into me troupe.
11815: Feast your eyes on the stunning steps of Troupe Brilioth!
11816: I began studying here after one of Laila's performances moved me to tears. Such grrrace...such talent...
11817: I overheard you speaking with Laila. So, you think you can dance?
11818: You'll have to show you're absolutely committed before she'll even think about taking you under her wing.
11819: Maybe I could ask Laila for some hints about this $3. But how can I be sure you're rrreally serious...?
11820: I know! Have you heard of the Lion Springs Tavern in San d'Oria?
11821: If you have the courrrage to dance on that stage, it will prrrove to me you have a passion for performance.
11822: If you have the courrrage to dance on the stage in the Lion Springs Tavern, I'll ask Laila about that $3.
11823: That must have been some performance you put on in the Lion Springs. News of your "unique" dancing style made it all the way to Jeuno.
11824: Well, I guess I have to keep my end of the deal and tell you what I learned about that stone.
11825: I hate to brrreak it to you, but finding $6 might be close to impossible.
11826: Twenty years ago, $5 could be found lying at the bottom of Lake Mechieume in Jugner Forest.
11827: But their dazzling glow made them such a collector's item that not a single one remains there today.
11828: I believe our merciless leader has set you a task that cannot be completed.
11829: It's a shame. While you still lack the skill, you certainly have the spirit of a dancer...
11830: Ye here again?
11831: Ye've brought me $6? If ye think ye can trick me with some painted piece o'...
11832: !!!
11833: Wh-where did ye get this!?
11834: And now I s'pose ye're going to hold me to my word, are ye?
11835: <Sigh>... Well, ye were up t'the task, and no mistakin'. Welcome to Troupe Brilioth.
11836: Ye know, I have another $3, but its light faded years ago...
11837: Lookin' at this rock reminds me o' the day I learned the true joy of dancin'.
11838: I can still hear the sound of the pipes...
11839: ...?
11840: Ye look awfully familiar fer some reason...
11841: Nah, it couldn't be...
11842: Now, before ye begin yer trainin', let me tell ye a little somethin' about the origin o' our dance.
11843: It's a martial style based on the traditional Bastokan "Kriegstanz"--a dance used in actual battle.
11844: O' course, we've learned how t'adapt this martial style into a form suitable fer performances.
11845: But first, ye'll have t'work on the basic, martial movements.
11846: Rhea! Show this rookie the ropes!
11847: And now yer body has been conditioned fer the fundamental movements o' the Kriegstanz.
11848: Don't just stand there scuffin' yer feet! I expect ye t'spend ev'ry spare moment practicin' those moves! Troupe Brilioth only accepts the best!
11849: You can now become a dancer!
11850: Dance is learned by doin', not by watchin'. Get yer body movin', and dance until ye drop!
11851: What are you gawpin' at? I don't give out autographs.
11852: I'm glad you've joined our little grrroup, but be warned: the hard work has only just begun!
11853: They're so pretty! I wanna be a dancer too someday!
11854: Two maidens of the battlefield...and a Galka?
11855: There are many "dancers," but only a select few are truly brilliant.
11856: And among those brilliant few, they say the most talented and graceful is visited by the Divinity of Dance. Could that be true?
11857: I've learned a lot about the Crystal War while looking after Ilumida.
11858: She's even told me about those awful statues people are calling "maws."
11859: I haven't had the experience myself, but they say just the very sight of these idols brings back the most horrendous memories of the war...
11860: I wonder if there are other things in the world that remind people of that horrible time. If only such atrocities could be buried forever.
11861: Do the beastmen also have a god to whom they pray, in the same way we ask for the blessings of Altana?
11862: Although I'm not sure I would want to know what twisted prayers the beastmen might make. Would you?
11863: Why, isn't it <Player>? Been workin' hard on yer steps, have ye?
11864: Why don't ye show me some o' yer moves? Go on, let me see.
11865: Hmmm...sharp, conf'dent steps, an' great upper body balance t'boot. Without a doubt, ye've improved.
11866: Looks like ye've been faithfully rehearsin' the basics o' our martial style, the "Kriegstanz."
11867: But yer dance still lacks a certain..."shine."
11868: Listen up. What Troupe Brilioth is aimin' fer is a dance style that captivates an' enchants.
11869: I want ye to think about how ye can make yer dance "shine."
11870: What Troupe Brilioth is aimin' fer is a dance style that captivates and enchants.
11871: What? You want to know what's lacking in your dance?
11872: That's a tough one... I personally believe you've imprrroved in leaps and bounds.
11873: Laila once told me about her childhood. Witchfire Glen, in Grauberg, was where her mother taught her to dance. She said that it was there she learned the true essence of dance.
11874: During the Great War, Witchfire Glen was rumored to be a mystical place, where pixies could be seen frolicking.
11875: Laila's mother selected only the most talented dancers, and trrrained them there. I would love to have been part of those lessons!
11876: I'm sorry I couldn't help you spice up your steps...
11877: Laila's mother selected only the most talented dancers, and trrrained them at Witchfire Glen, in Grauberg.
11878: So, <Player>. Did ye work out how to make yer dance "shine"?
11879: Ye think ye got the goods now? Go on then, give us a gander.
11880: Well, well, wasn't that somethin'.
11881: "A masterful dance can be the most lethal of weapons; a skillful fight, the most elegant of dances." These be the words of me dear mother.
11882: But there's a key difference b'tween dancin' on stage, an' dancin' in battle.
11883: On stage, ye're dancin' in front o' an audience, with the goal o' bringin' smiles to their faces.
11884: Yer desire to entertain an' please the audience is what makes yer dance "shine." Don't ye be forgettin' that.
11885: Laila! I've just met with Wyatt, the guy who runs a business prrromoting performance troupes...
11886: He said that Troupe Valeriano is next scheduled to perform rrright here, in Jeuno.
11887: Troupe Valeriano...in Jeuno!?
11888: Apparently, the leader of the trrroupe wants to come speak with you when they arrive.
11889: What business would the likes o' Troupe Valeriano possibly have with me?
11890: ...
11891: Hey hey, that's enough daydreamin' already! Get back t'yer practicin'!
11892: I won't tolerate any o' yer makin' a fool o' yerself in front o' Troupe Valeriano!
11893: I wonder why she's gotten crrranky all of a sudden.
11894: Just a minute ago she was singing prrraises of you, <Player>, and even asked me to prepare something to give to you.
11895: I didn't think the news would tick her off like that... No news is good news, huh?
11896: Enough with the daydreamin'! <Player>, I wanna see more "shine" on that dance o' yers!
11897: I wonder why she's gotten cranky all of a sudden...
11898: Practicin' hard, <Player>?
11899: Show me yer progress from time t'time, will ye?
11900: Hmmm...
11901: Not bad, but ye still have a long way t'go if ye want t'be diva o' the dance troupe.
11902: Have ye ever danced to a musician's tune?
11903: On stage, a dancer must be one with the musicians who perform the accompaniment.
11904: Even when ye practice, ye've to visualize the music in yer mind, or ye'll become a self-centered dancer.
11905: An' I guarantee ye, self-centered dancers don't get very far.
11906: To become a top-notch dancer, ye have t'work with a top-notch musician. I recommend ye find yerself a good musician who'll play a tune fer ye t'dance to.
11907: Let me tell ye a story. When I was little, I once skipped practice an' stole off to a lake in Jugner Forest. It was there that me ears were treated to a most marvelous pipe tune. Its soul-stirrin' melody is still vivid in me mind t'this day.
11908: Even though I never actually saw the person playin', it was this chance encounter that made me the dancer I am today.
11909: If only I knew who was playing that tune, I would share its inspiration with ye, <Player>.
11910: <Sigh> It was such a long time ago...
11911: If ye want t'become a top-notch dancer, ye better go an' find a top-notch musician t'work with.
11912: I wish I could meet a splendid musician who could strrrum on my heartstrings.
11913: Ye say ye met a bard who played a tune fer ye t'dance to?
11914: Alright then, let's see how ye've improved.
11915: ...!
11916: Th-that was incredible!
11917: That bard ye met must've been quite somethin'.
11918: It's high time ye had this.
11919: Ye've come a long way, <Player>.
11920: T'be honest, on the day ye brought the $3 an' I had t'accept ye into Troupe Brilioth, I didn't know how ye'd turn out.
11921: But ye've exceeded all expectations.
11922: Aye, it's unfortunate, but the pebble ye brought has lost its glow.
11923: The same happened with me pebble I've had with me fer ages. See?
11924: What the...!?
11925: Excuse me, but you are Troupe Brilioth, are you not? It is an honor to meet you.
11926: V-Valeriano!
11927: What? Can it really be...Laila? It's you, isn't it!
11928: You know each other, Laila?
11929: N-no...
11930: You don't remember? Ten years ago...you came to me wanting to join Troupe Valeriano.
11931: No way!!!
11932: Is it trrrue, Laila?
11933: <Sigh> I suppose there's no use hidin' it...
11934: My, my, what a splendid dancer you have matured into! When I heard the news from Wyatt about the promising new dance troupe, I had a hunch that you'd be the one behind it, Laila.
11935: And such a fine dance troupe under your wings! Now I am certain it was the right decision to turn you down ten years ago.
11936: I've been looking forward to seeing you dance again, Laila. I'll be seeing more of you soon!
11937: Laila... What he just said...
11938: All o' it's true, Rhea.
11939: Except fer one thing... He has never, ever, seen me dance. How can he look forward t'seein' me "again" when he has never seen me...even once?
11940: How horrible!
11941: Ten years ago, me mother staged a big dance production, an' I was selected fer the lead role.
11942: It was the proudest moment in me life. It was all the more special because Mother was a strict teacher who didn't give special favors t'anyone, not even her own daughter.
11943: Not long after me debut as lead, Troupe Valeriano came t'town.
11944: Even back then, Troupe Valeriano had already grown into a circus o' a grand scale, with musicians as well as dancers in its repertory.
11945: Their performances were a hit with both young and old.
11946: It was the first circus I'd ever seen in me life, an' I was hopelessly spellbound.
11947: By the time they were packin' up t'move on, I was determined to join them. I wanted t'join Troupe Valeriano so badly, I took no heed o' objections from those around me.
11948: Waaait!
11949: And you are...?
11950: Me name's Laila Brilioth, an' I'm the number one dancer in town!
11951: Aaah, yes...
11952: I went to yer troupe's performances, and I liked what I saw!
11953: Why, I'm pleased to hear that. Thank you.
11954: So I've decided t'join ye.
11955: Is that so...
11956: Yer troupe will be soooooo much better with me dancin'.
11957: Thank you for offering...
11958: But, no thank you.
11959: Huh...?
11960: I'm afraid I cannot accept you into our troupe.
11961: I don't understand... Why won't ye accept me!?
11962: If ye would just watch me dance, ye'll see how good I am!
11963: I've already made up my mind, so that won't be necessary. I'm very sorry...
11964: ...
11965: <Sniffle> Such a heartbreaking story...
11966: Not long after that, a great fire burned down Troupe Valeriano's tent an' all their equipment. The members were forced t'disband.
11967: All the dancers left, too.
11968: It was a big setback, an' I sincerely sympathize with them fer their misfortune. But, I've never forgotten the humiliation I felt when I was rejected.
11969: After the incident, I left home an' formed Troupe Brilioth.
11970: I was determined to surpass Troupe Valeriano, and did all I could t'get where I am today.
11971: I'm proud o' what I've achieved. But above that, I'm proud o' all o' ye.
11972: I've never forgotten the humiliation I felt when I was rejected by Valeriano.
11973: I never knew Laila had crossed paths with Troupe Valeriano in the past...
11974: I can't believe Troupe Valeriano rejected a great dancer like Laila... What were they thinking?
11975: <Player>, just the adventurer I was lookin' fer.
11976: I was thinkin' it's about time ye stepped on stage, an'...
11977: ...?
11978: Howdy folks! You mus' be Troupe Brilioth!
11979: An' who might ye be?
11980: The name's Wyatt, an' I work in the performance business. Boy have I godda proposal fur you!
11981: Fur mah next production, I've organized fur Troupe Valeriano t'come an' perform raht 'ere in Jeuno.
11982: An' I was thinkin' t'mahself, how magnificen' it would be if troupes Brilioth an' Valeriano could collaborate in a circus an' dance extravaganza!
11983: These be the deetails o' mah proposal... So whad'ya think?
11984: Sounds interestin'... But what does Troupe Valeriano have t'say about it?
11985: Well ma'am, that's jes' the prawblem... Troupe Valeriano's bayn busy tourin' the three nations, so I haven't had a chance t'speak with'em prawperly yet.
11986: Why don't ye leave that to us? We'll go an' inform Valeriano fer ye.
11987: Well ain't that sweet! I'd be most grateful if you could pass the proposal to them. Guess I'll be seein' y'all later then.
11988: <Player>, I want ye to take this proposal to the music shop in Bastok Markets, an' pass it to the owner o' the establishment.
11989: Valeriano often goes there, so I'm told.
11990: Pass $3 to the owner o' the music shop in Bastok Markets. Valeriano is supposed t'be a regular patron.
11991: Why did Laila agrrree to a collaboration? I thought she didn't like Troupe Valeriano...
11992: Oh dear... Just thinking about performing alongside Troupe Valeriano gives me butterflies.
11993: What? Ye met Valeriano himself at the music shop?
11994: So...what did he think about the proposal?
11995: Really? He was that enthusiastic? Well, isn't that sweet...
11996: Hahahahahaaa!
11997: I've been waitin' fer this day fer so long...the day I surpass Valeriano.
11998: When Wyatt came here an' told us about his plan, I could barely contain me excitement.
11999: Needless t'say, ye'll dance with us too, <Player>.
12000: This is the perfect opportunity...
12001: We'll show Troupe Valeriano who the audience prefers.
12002: That reminds me, ye've never performed on stage before, have ye?
12003: If ye ask Rhea Myuliah, she'll give ye tips an' tricks on how t'please the crowd when ye dance.
12004: We're dancin' fer real this time, so no slackin' off before the performance!
12005: No slackin' off before the performance!
12006: A collaboration's one thing, but a showdown? What could Laila possibly be thinking?
12007: For the upcoming performance, we will dance with Troupe Valeriano perforrrming beside us.
12008: The whole purpose of the collaborrration is to allow the audience to enjoy both circus and dance performances simultaneously... But Laila is hell-bent on outdoing Troupe Valeriano.
12009: So we must perform a style of dance that will please and drrraw the audience's attention.
12010: Just to give you a general idea...
12011: Younger folk tend to prrrefer waltz, the elderly are more fond of samba, while little kiddies can't get enough of jigs.
12012: While you're dancing, observe what type of crrrowd is watching Troupe Valeriano's circus performance, then dance a style that is to their taste.
12013: If you do so, the crowd will be surrre to turn their attention to Troupe Brilioth's performance instead.
12014: But you also mustn't neglect those who are alrrready watching us.
12015: If a style of dance isn't to their taste, it's only a matterrr of time before the audience turns their attention elsewhere.
12016: Does that make sense? Would you like to prrractice?
12017: Practice pleasing the audience? [Bring it on!/Maybe later...]
12018: I know how you feel... Competing for the audience isn't my idea of fun either, but let's just give it our best, okay?
12019: Alright then, I'll prrretend to be Troupe Valeriano...not that I can juggle or anything.
12020: What will you dance? [Waltz/Samba/Jig]
12021: Hrrrm... No offense, <Player>, but at this rate I think my juggling will be able to attrrract a bigger crowd.
12022: That was grrreat, <Player>! Laila will be pleased if you can keep up the good form.
12023: Please excuse our lateness. I hope you were not waiting too long.
12024: I've been waitin' ten whole years. A few more minutes won't make any difference.
12025: Hm...? I'm not sure I understand.
12026: Valeriano, today's the day I make ye regret ye ever rejected me!
12027: L-Laila...
12028: <Player>, ye remember how t'please the audience?
12029: Do ye remember? [Sure do!/Uh...]
12030: Didn't I ask ye to prepare fer today? Rhea, give <Player> a refresher!
12031: Rrright away, Laila.
12032: Ye got it?
12033: Give the audience what they want so they watch us an' not Troupe Valeriano!
12034: That's enough talk. <Player>, show them what ye got!
12035: Alright then... <Player>! It's showtime!!!
12036: Laila, we've lost almost the entire audience to Troupe Valeriano!
12037: Grrr... We'll save the rest fer tomorrow. This isn't over yet...
12038: We'll show them next time.
12039: Losing to Troupe Valeriano like that... <Sigh>
12040: We went easy on ye yesterday, but no more! Today I'll make ye regret ever rejectin' me from joinin' Troupe Valeriano!
12041: Sir, the dancers have snatched the audience away from us...
12042: (Laila, what has become of you...?)
12043: (This is not what I had envisioned...not what I came for...)
12044: (What I wanted...was...)
12045: That pipe...?
12046: Could this be true...?
12047: All those years ago, ye were the one playin' the pipe at Lake Mechieume...
12048: Heard the silvery sound of the boss's piping before, have you?
12049: Aye... A long time ago, when I was but a child...
12050: I was born daughter to a renowned family o' dancers, an' grew up in the midst o' the Crystal War... Dance was me life, an' all I knew. But one day I became fed up with day after day o' endless drills, an' decided to run away from home.
12051: That was when I first heard the pipe, down by Lake Mechieume. Its soul-stirrin' melody flowed through me, guidin' each step, each whirl an' pirouette...
12052: It revived me dwindlin' passion fer dance an' inspired me t'continue. Everythin' I have, I owe to that pipe.
12053: I haven't forgotten that day, Laila...the day I first saw you dance.
12054: You were watchin'...?
12055: It was the most uplifting sight I have ever had the privilege of laying my eyes upon.
12056: When <Player> delivered the proposal to me in Bastok, I thanked the Goddess for giving me the opportunity to watch you dance once more.
12057: ......
12058: B-but I can't do it... I don't have it in me anymore. Since the day ye rejected me, me sole purpose in life has been t'surpass ye.
12059: The only reason I've been dancin' all these years, was so I could look down me nose at ye. I-I don't deserve t'be a dancer...
12060: I am to blame for having caused you so much pain. Please forgive me, Laila.
12061: But...I still firmly believe I made the right decision. It would have been wrong to accept the most promising young dancer Vana'diel has ever seen into our troupe.
12062: What...?
12063: You were brought up surrounded by loved ones, and destined to become successor to the famed Brilioth style.
12064: Though tender of age, your talent had already bloomed beyond compare. Never before had such a young dancer been selected lead in your mother's production--even I knew this...
12065: But I had no right to pluck you away from where you belonged.
12066: You deserved so much more than I could have ever offered in my troupe.
12067: No circus tent could ever be large enough for you to grow and fulfill your potential, Laila...
12068: So...ye rejected me not because ye didn't think I was good enough?
12069: The answer is clear, Laila. You are everything a dancer could ever wish to be.
12070: I regret not having explained my decision more clearly when I turned you down.
12071: Even if ye did, I don't think I would've understood...
12072: I so wanted t'join Troupe Valeriano, I lost sight o' all those who cared about me most...
12073: I was--am--just a stupid girl...
12074: You need not be ashamed.
12075: Just look at the wonderful dance troupe that you have created! Cast your eyes upon the scores of fans who love you!
12076: V-Valeriano...
12077: Laila... Will you do me the great honor of dancing for me? Just like that time so many years ago?
12078: Aye!
12079: I have never enjoyed performing as I did today. I very much look forward to our next collaboration.
12080: Alright everyone, it's time to go.
12081: Hm?
12082: That pebble...
12083: My $3's twin... So you had it with you all this time.
12084: They finally found each other again...
12085: I'm goin' t'start over. Just like the day I found this pebble by the lake.
12086: I trust it will not take another twenty years before I next see you dance. All the best, Laila.
12087: Were my eyes just playing trrricks on me? Could it actually be...true?
12088: What am I talking about?
12089: You see, there is a legend that says that the most talented and grrraceful of dancers are visited by the Divinity of Dance.
12090: But I never actually believed it until this day... Just now when Laila was dancing, I could have sworn...
12091: But beforrre I forget, Laila was wanting to give something to you, <Player>. Why don't you go and speak with her?
12092: That was a helluva debut performance, <Player>. Ye never cease t'impress me.
12093: Nothin' rings truer than "practice makes perfect." Here, this is fer all yer hard work.
12094: I've been such a fool all these years, usin' dance just t'try to patch up me broken ego.
12095: It's kinda embarrassin' to admit, but I haven't enjoyed dancin' like that fer ages.
12096: How I'd love t'dance beside Valeriano again...
12097: Here, take this. Ye deserve it fer all yer hard work.
12098: Dance can be illusive at times--the harder ye seek, the more ye lose sight o' it...
12099: When that happens, just clear all unnecessary thoughts from ye mind an' ev'rythin' will be alright.
12100: I will strrrive to become a great dancer like Laila.
12101: Golly! I can't remember the last time I enjoyed myself so much!
12102: You're so pretty! I wanna be a dancer like you someday!
12103: I remember a time during the Crystal War when I found myself surrounded by the enemy in battle. I had given up all hope when Field Musician dancers came to my rescue.
12104: With little more than a graceful wave of their arms, my wounds were healed and pains soothed. It felt as though the Goddess herself had descended from her celestial realm...
12105: The performance was touching beyond words. I have not a shred of doubt in my heart that the Divinity of Dance exists...
12106: Practicin' hard as usual, <Player>?
12107: I've been meanin' to ask ye, have ye ever heard of $0?
12108: They're marks that the Divinity o' Dance bestows t'dancers who are deemed worthy.
12109: Ye've traveled through many a land durin' yer trainin' t'become a dancer.
12110: If ye retrace yer steps, the Divinity o' Dance may appear before ye an' present ye with $0.
12111: If that ever happens, bring the $0 back here an' show me.
12112: Got yerself $0, ye say? Give us a gander.
12113: There's no mistakin', this is the real McCoy...
12114: This means the Divinity o' Dance has deemed ye worthy. Ye've earned the right t'undertake the test t'become Diva o' the Dance Troupe.
12115: It's a title given t'dancers who are blessed by the Divinity o' Dance. The catch is, there can be no more than one such dancer in a troupe.
12116: Ye can now challenge t'become Troupe Brilioth's "diva."
12117: Who's gonna test ye? Why, that'll be yers truly, of course. I never imagined this day would come.
12118: In our martial style, there's no better way t'test one's ability than t'go head-to-head. But don't ye think I'll be holdin' back, <Player>.
12119: We'll duke it out at Qu'Bia Arena. Ye ready to go?
12120: Go to Qu'Bia Arena? [Ready when you are!/I need time to prepare...]
12121: Is that so. Then come back here after ye've finished whatever ye have t'do.
12122: Good. When ye arrive, use yer $0 t'enter the arena.
12123: Your $0 is torn...
12124: Yer destiny is t'seek out bigger stages until ye one day become diva to the whole o' Vana'diel.
12125: Prrromise me you'll come back to dance with us again, <Player>.
12126: "Diva of the Dance Troupe"... It sounds so dreamy... <Sigh>
12127: Oh hey there, <Player>. I was wondering where you were.
12128: I've been meaning to have a heart-to-heart with you for some time now. Don't take this the wrong way, but...have you ever considered getting a tailor-made dancer outfit? Hmmm?
12129: As professionals, we have to take extra care with our appearance, you know. And it just so happens that there's this tailor I know you'd just love!
12130: His name is Matthias. The garments he makes at his shop in Bastok Markets are simply sublime!
12131: We've all had our outfits made up by Matthias, even the $0 Laila's wearing. Just gorgeous, aren't they?
12132: You should definitely have Matthias make you an outfit, too. I promise you won't regret it!
12133: You should definitely have him make you an outfit, too. I promise you won't regret it!
12134: Well, well, aren't we looking [dashing/gorgeous] today? I see you've been a good [boy/girl] and went to see Matthias, just like I recommended!
12135: But, oh wow... Your dancer attire... I-it's lovelier than I had expected. It's as though...the Divinity of Dance is among us...
12136: You a fan of the dance as well, then?
12137: Don't get me wrong, the dance shows that are put on nowadays are all well and good. But they're nothing compared to the shows of old, back in the days when dance was in its prime!
12138: You ever hear of Troupe Mayakov? They were one of the more popular dance troupes making the rounds about the time of the Crystal War.
12139: They had a young girl amongst them. Absolutely beautiful thing. The "Moonshade Butterfly," they called her. They are still talking in San d'Oria today about the solo performance she gave in Lion Square all those years ago.
12140: I was lucky enough to get hold of a ticket for that show. Got all the way to the tavern before my wife managed to track me down and drag me back home.
12141: <Sigh>... That's one regret that'll stay with me the rest of my days.
12142: Even now I still carry the ticket with me. Just as a reminder of how close I once came to seeing perfection on the stage.
12143: See, have a look. It's gotten quite beaten up over the years, as can be expected. I don't suppose there's much use in hanging on to it anymore, though.
12144: Huh? You actually want this old thing? You sure?
12145: Fine with me, I guess. It's nothing more than a scrap of paper at this point. You adventurers sure are a weird lot...

12153: Ah, <Player>, good timing as always. There's something you should know.
12154: Just a short while ago, I was apprrroached by a promising young writer.
12155: For his next project, he said that he wanted to write a story about you and [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji].
12156: For his next project, he said that he wanted to write a story about you and [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde].
12157: For his next project, he said that he wanted to write a story about you and [Chanandit/Deulmaeux/Demresinaux/Ephealgaux/Gauldeval/Grauffemart/Migaifongut/Romidiant].
12158: For his next project, he said that he wanted to write a story about you and [Armittie/Cadepure/Clearite/Epilleve/Liabelle/Nauthima/Radille/Vimechue].
12159: For his next project, he said that he wanted to write a story about you and [Balu-Falu/Burg-Ladarg/Ehgo-Ryuhgo/Kolui-Pelui/Nokum-Akkum/Savul-Kivul/Vinja-Kanja/Yarga-Umiga].
12160: For his next project, he said that he wanted to write a story about you and [Cupapa/Jajuju/Kalokoko/Mahoyaya/Pakurara/Ripokeke/Yawawa/Yufafa].
12161: For his next project, he said that he wanted to write a story about you and [Fhig Lahrv/Khuma Tagyawhan/Pimy Kettihl/Raka Maimhov/Sahyu Banjyao/Sufhi Uchnouma/Tsuim Nhomango/Yoli Kohlpaka].
12162: He said that for his next project, he wanted to write a story about you and [Durib/Dzapiwa/Jugowa/Mugido/Voldai/Wagwei/Zayag/Zoldof].
12163: I've no idea how he found out, but he showerrred me with questions about the Glass of All-Seeing, and in his own words, what he thought to be a "fated meeting" between you two.
12164: He ranted on and on about how he thought your two stories would be perrrfect for his yet-to-be-written book.
12165: Sounded interesting and all, but since I'm not your manager or anything, I sent him on his way. He did say, though, that he intended to stay in Jeuno for a while.
12166: Last I heard, he was hanging out in the Ru'Lude Gardens. Perrrhaps you'll run into him.
12167: What's up, <Player>?
12168: I'm afrrraid I don't have any new assignments for you right now.
12169: Hey hey, what are you looking at me like that for? It's not like I've been slacking off on information-gathering duty or anything. On the contrary, I've actually had quite a few jobs lined up for you rrrecently.
12170: But you just never seem to be around when something comes up, <Player>. [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji], on the other hand, has been snatching up new jobs morrre quickly than I can find them.
12171: But you just never seem to be around when something comes up, <Player>. [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde], on the other hand, has been snatching up new jobs morrre quickly than I can find them.

12178: Also, since there hasn't rrreally been anything that either one of you couldn't have handled solo, [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji] has been going about things on his own.

12186: Not that I'm complaining, but things have been rather quiet since the mirror incident.
12187: I mean, whatever happened to mouthwatering rrrumors along the lines of, say, a secret organization smuggling priceless treasures out of Aht Urhgan...?
12188: What are you daydreaming about this time, Luto?
12189: What's that, Luto? Are we rooting out thieves next?
12190: You're an incurable daydreamer, Luto.
12191: I thought the unsavory episode with the Mirror of Blighted Gloom had ruined your taste for risky business, Luto.
12192: What's wrong with a little peace and quiet from time to time, Luto?
12193: Did you say a high sea encounter with scantily clad female pirates!? Count me in!
12194: What manner of mischief are you scheming now, Luto?
12195: Now now, Luto. Even if we did find such a treasure, we have to do the right thing and give it back to the owner!
12196: Having fun daydreaming again, Luto?
12197: If you want treasures so badly, Luto, you should try stealing them yourself.
12198: I thought the unsavory episode with the Mirror of Blighted Gloom had ruined your taste for risky business, Luto.
12199: Since when did we start dealing in stolen goods, Luto?
12200: Well, pull my whiskers... Finished with the monster already, [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji]?
12201: Well, pull my whiskers... Finished with the monster already, [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde]?
12202: Well, pull my whiskers... Finished with the monster already, [Chanandit/Deulmaeux/Demresinaux/Ephealgaux/Gauldeval/Grauffemart/Migaifongut/Romidiant]?
12203: Well, pull my whiskers... Finished with the monster already, [Armittie/Cadepure/Clearite/Epilleve/Liabelle/Nauthima/Radille/Vimechue]?
12204: Well, pull my whiskers... Finished with the monster already, [Balu-Falu/Burg-Ladarg/Ehgo-Ryuhgo/Kolui-Pelui/Nokum-Akkum/Savul-Kivul/Vinja-Kanja/Yarga-Umiga]?
12205: Well, pull my whiskers... Finished with the monster already, [Cupapa/Jajuju/Kalokoko/Mahoyaya/Pakurara/Ripokeke/Yawawa/Yufafa]?
12206: Well, pull my whiskers... Finished with the monster already, [Fhig Lahrv/Khuma Tagyawhan/Pimy Kettihl/Raka Maimhov/Sahyu Banjyao/Sufhi Uchnouma/Tsuim Nhomango/Yoli Kohlpaka]?
12207: Well, pull my whiskers... Finished with the monster already, [Durib/Dzapiwa/Jugowa/Mugido/Voldai/Wagwei/Zayag/Zoldof]?
12208: Well, to be honest, it was hardly a challenge.
12209: A small fry like that!? I barely broke a sweat!
12210: The monster was nothing to write home about.
12211: I'm pleased to respond in the affirmative. For a low-level creature like that, very little exertion was required on my part.
12212: The monster was waaay too easy, Luto. I want to fight something bigger and meaner...and uglier next time!
12213: Give me some credit, Luto! I could've taken care of ten more like that and still be home in time for supper!
12214: All in a day's work, Luto, all in a day's work. I'll need to do something about this broken nail, though...
12215: Hey, come on now! It's me we're talking about here!
12216: I'm sorry it took so long... I got a little peckish on the way back, so I went and grabbed a bite to eat, and ended up doing some shopping, too.
12217: I wish you were there to see me, Luto! A smash and a bash...and then, crash! Game over, mister monster!
12218: I'm pleased to respond in the affirmative. For a low-level creature like that, very little exertion was required on my part.
12219: The poor creature was utterly defenseless. I gained no pleasure in its defeat.
12220: My, my, aren't we full of ourselves today?
12221: But, well done nevertheless. Now, let's get down to business.
12222: I must say, it's not often that we come by such a generrrous client like this. Let's see here... That's half of 30 million gil each for you and me...
12223: Here's your hard-earned 15 million gil. Don't go spending it all at once!
12224: Is something the matter, <Player>?
12225: What's up, <Player>? You look kinda pale.
12226: What is it, <Player>?
12227: You look like you've seen a ghost, <Player>. Are you feeling unwell?
12228: Are you okay, <Player>?
12229: Why are you looking at me like that, <Player>?
12230: You don't look too well. Are you alright, kiddo?
12231: Hm? What's wrong, <Player>?
12232: You look a bit pale, <Player>. Are you okay?
12233: Hmmm? What is it, <Player>?
12234: You look like you've seen a ghost, <Player>. Are you feeling unwell?
12235: What is it, <Player>?
12236: I think <Player> might be feeling a little upset at being left out, [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji].
12237: I think <Player> might be feeling a little upset at being left out, [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde].
12238: I think <Player> might be feeling a little upset at being left out, [Chanandit/Deulmaeux/Demresinaux/Ephealgaux/Gauldeval/Grauffemart/Migaifongut/Romidiant].
12239: I think <Player> might be feeling a little upset at being left out, [Armittie/Cadepure/Clearite/Epilleve/Liabelle/Nauthima/Radille/Vimechue].
12240: I think <Player> might be feeling a little upset at being left out, [Balu-Falu/Burg-Ladarg/Ehgo-Ryuhgo/Kolui-Pelui/Nokum-Akkum/Savul-Kivul/Vinja-Kanja/Yarga-Umiga].
12241: I think <Player> might be feeling a little upset at being left out, [Cupapa/Jajuju/Kalokoko/Mahoyaya/Pakurara/Ripokeke/Yawawa/Yufafa].
12242: I think <Player> might be feeling a little upset at being left out, [Fhig Lahrv/Khuma Tagyawhan/Pimy Kettihl/Raka Maimhov/Sahyu Banjyao/Sufhi Uchnouma/Tsuim Nhomango/Yoli Kohlpaka].
12243: I think <Player> might be feeling a little upset at being left out, [Durib/Dzapiwa/Jugowa/Mugido/Voldai/Wagwei/Zayag/Zoldof].
12244: What? That's ridiculous. A menial task like this couldn't possibly be of any interest to <Player>.
12245: Are you serious, Luto? Why would <Player> want to get [his/her] hands dirty doing a boring job like this?
12246: Are you kidding, Luto? With all [his/her] experience, <Player> would have more job offers than [he/she] could shake a stick at.
12247: That's an interesting speculation, Luto. But I highly doubt that an adventurer of <Player>'s caliber would at all be interested in such tasks of inconsequential nature.
12248: What? But why would <Player> be interested in doing a boring job like this?
12249: Upset? That's crazy talk! <Player>'s got much better ways to spend [his/her] time.
12250: Why would you say that? With all [his/her] experience, <Player> would have more job offers than [he/she] could poke a stick at.
12251: Upset? No way! <Player>'s got much better things to do with [his/her] time than whacking pesky little monsters.
12252: <Player> is not the kind of person to get upset at something trivial like that. On the contrary, [he/she]'d be happy to see that a friend is doing so well for herself.
12253: What? But why would <Player> want to do a boring job like this?
12254: That's an interesting speculation, Luto. But I highly doubt that an adventurer of <Player>'s caliber would at all be interested in such tasks of inconsequential nature.
12255: What gives you that idea, Luto? <Player> needs a much greater challenge than this if [he/she] is to further develop as an adventurer.
12256: I see your point there, [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji]. But if you ask me, you two really aren't that far aparrrt. If you and <Player> were to go head-to-head in battle, I wouldn't know who to put my gil on.
12257: I see your point there, [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde]. But if you ask me, you two really aren't that far aparrrt. If you and <Player> were to go head-to-head in battle, I wouldn't know who to put my gil on.

12260: I see your point there, [Balu-Falu/Burg-Ladarg/Ehgo-Ryuhgo/Kolui-Pelui/Nokum-Akkum/Savul-Kivul/Vinja-Kanja/Yarga-Umiga]. But if you ask me, you two really aren't that far aparrrt. If you and <Player> were to go head-to-head in battle, I wouldn't know who to put my gil on.
12261: I see your point there, [Cupapa/Jajuju/Kalokoko/Mahoyaya/Pakurara/Ripokeke/Yawawa/Yufafa]. But if you ask me, you two really aren't that far aparrrt. If you and <Player> were to go head-to-head in battle, I wouldn't know who to put my gil on.
12262: I see your point there, [Fhig Lahrv/Khuma Tagyawhan/Pimy Kettihl/Raka Maimhov/Sahyu Banjyao/Sufhi Uchnouma/Tsuim Nhomango/Yoli Kohlpaka]. But if you ask me, you two really aren't that far aparrrt. If you and <Player> were to go head-to-head in battle, I wouldn't know who to put my gil on.

12264: You, in particularrr, have matured a great deal as an adventurer since we first met, [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji].
12265: You, in particularrr, have matured a great deal as an adventurer since we first met, [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde].

12271: You, in particularrr, [Durib/Dzapiwa/Jugowa/Mugido/Voldai/Wagwei/Zayag/Zoldof], have matured a great deal as an adventurer since we first met.
12272: I have <Player> to thank for that. But you've brought up an interesting point there, Luto.
12273: You really think so? Heheh, that's kinda embarrassing! But you've given me a good idea there, Luto.
12274: Hey, don't misunderstand me there. I never said that I thought myself weaker than <Player>. I'm never short on job offers myself, you know.
12275: Hohoho! Flattery truly is your forte, Luto.
12276: You think so, Luto? Even if that's true, I owe it all to <Player> for getting this far.
12277: Me? As good as <Player>? That's crazy talk, too, Luto!
12278: Er...Luto, if I'm not mistaken, you just suggested in a roundabout way that I'm inferior to <Player>?
12279: Even if what you say is true, Luto, I owe it all to <Player>!
12280: That's very sweet of you to say that, Luto.
12281: Awww, you're such a sweetie, Luto. Hey, do you think that maybe I could even beat <Player>?
12282: Ohohoho! Flattery truly is your forte, Luto.
12283: That's because I've never once strayed from my strict training routine. I know for a fact, though, that <Player> has been less than diligent recently. There's no use denying it, <Player>.
12284: I certainly wouldn't mind testing myself against <Player> in battle.
12285: I must admit, I've been wondering who is stronger, <Player> or yours truly.
12286: But you've certainly sparked my curiosity, Luto. I'm starting to wonder how I'd measure up going head-to-head against <Player>.
12287: But, I must admit that I oft wonder how I would fare against <Player>, if we were to go head-to-head.
12288: But, I wonder how strong adventuring beside <Player> has made me, exactly? I'd really love to find out.
12289: But, you've certainly brought up an interesting point there. I wonder how strong I really am?
12290: Hmph... Looks like we need to set the facts straight once and for all. And there's only one way to do so...
12291: But, sometimes I do wonder how strong I actually am. Seeing how you've been my measuring stick all this time, <Player>...
12292: But the truth is, I've been holding myself back all this time.
12293: I wonder how strong I really am? Aaah, the curiosity is killing me!
12294: But, I must admit that I oft wonder how I would fare against <Player>, if we were to go head-to-head.
12295: I've allowed you to slack off for far too long now. I shall personally see to it that you're set back on track.
12296: What do you think, <Player>? About us two duking it out?
12297: So, what say you and me do away with the formalities and get rough on each other?
12298: So, how about it, <Player>? What do you say to a friendly test of strength?
12299: <Player>, would you accept my invitation to a friendly test of mettle?
12300: Hey, I know! <Player>, why don't we try fighting against each other?
12301: <Player>, I challenge you to a single combat!
12302: We're going to duke it out, kiddo, you and me!
12303: How about you and me have a friendly bout to test each other's strength?
12304: I owe it to both of you to show what I'm actually capable of. <Player>, can I rely on you to be my sparring partner?
12305: <Player>, I really really want to know! Can I have a duel with you, pretty please?
12306: <Player>, would you accept my invitation to a friendly test of mettle?
12307: A training duel between you and me will demonstrate how far you've regressed, <Player>. There is nothing better than a good, solid concussion to make slackers wake up to themselves. What say you?
12308: Um...I didn't mean to suggest anything of the sort. But I must admit, I'm warrrming up to the idea.
12309: So what will it be? Don't feel pressured or anything.
12310: So, how about it? Will you fight, or am I going to have to win by forfeit?
12311: So, how about it? The decision is in your hands.
12312: I for one would dearly love the opportunity to do battle with you. But, you need not feel pressured to oblige me.
12313: What do you think? It's a good idea, isn't it?
12314: So what will it be? Just so you know, I won't take no for an answer.
12315: Just in case you misunderstood me, that was a statement, not a question.
12316: Come on, say yes! It'll be great, I guarantee!
12317: What do you say, <Player>? You don't mind, right?
12318: Come on, you have to say yes! If you don't, I'll tell everyone I beat you anyway!
12319: I for one would dearly love the opportunity to do battle with you. But, you need not feel pressured to oblige me.
12320: I'm still waiting for a response, <Player>. And there's only one I'm interested in!
12321: Fight your fellow? [Sure, why not!/But, but...]
12322: Don't take it so seriously, <Player>. After all, it's just a frrriendly bout.
12323: So it's settled! As for the venue, what better place for good friends to trrrade blows than the Qu'Bia Arena?
12324: The Qu'Bia Arena is fine with me. I'll be waiting there, so come whenever you're ready, <Player>.
12325: Woohoo! Qu'Bia Arena, here I come! Don't keep me waiting, <Player>!
12326: I'm cool with the Qu'Bia Arena. See you there in a little while then, <Player>.
12327: I was about to suggest the very same venue. Prepare yourself as you see fit, <Player>, then come to the Qu'Bia Arena. I shall be waiting there.
12328: Yay! I've always wanted to fight there! I'll go on ahead to the Qu'Bia Arena, so come whenever you're ready, okay?
12329: Alright! The Qu'Bia Arena! Get yourself prepared, <Player>. I'll meet you there in a bit.
12330: The Qu'Bia Arena is fine with me. I'm going on ahead, <Player>.
12331: Woohoo! Qu'Bia Arena, here we come! I'll be waiting there, <Player>!
12332: Then all the details are settled. <Player>, I'll be waiting for you at the Qu'Bia Arena, so come after you've prepared, okay?
12333: Yay, the Qu'Bia Arena! I'll be waiting, so don't forget our promise, <Player>!
12334: I was about to suggest the very same venue. Prepare yourself as you see fit, <Player>, then come to the Qu'Bia Arena. I shall be waiting there.
12335: A fitting venue to spur us into the mood. For a civilian, you certainly know your battlefields, Luto. Prepare yourself well, <Player>! I will be waiting.
12336: This should be interesting.
12337: This is gonna be great!
12338: I'll be waiting.
12339: I'm very much looking forward to our encounter.
12340: I can't wait!
12341: I haven't felt my blood pumping this hard for ages!
12342: Don't keep me waiting, you hear?
12343: This is so exciting!
12344: See you soon, <Player>.
12345: This is so exciting! Wheeeeee!
12346: I'm very much looking forward to our encounter.
12347: And don't you dare even thinking about running away!
12348: Ah, I've seen you before. You're a mercenary from Salaheem's Sentinels, are you not? It is so refreshing to see one of our own out in these parts, spreading the company's good name.
12349: By the way, might you have already heard the news? You haven't? In that case, it'd be my pleasure to inform you!
12350: With our beloved President Naja's blessing, we've commenced the operation of a teleportation service right here in Jeuno! Within the space of a heartbeat, you'll be whisked all the way to Aht Urhgan Whitegate, the gateway to the exotic Near East! Doesn't the thought alone invigorate your entire being?
12351: Oh, it doesn't? Well, if ever you change your mind, just come here and trade me $0 gil. What's it for, you ask? Ha! You are quite the jokester, my friend!
12352: <Gasp>... I see... You needn't say another word. Just close your eyes, take a deep breath, and try to relax.
12353: A pleasant journey to you!
12354: Welcome, kupo!
12355: Oh, Master, there you are!
12356: And not a moment too soon, kupo! This way, this way!
12357: Now, whatever could the trouble be? Let's take a look-see.
12358: A letter? How curious, kupo...
12359: Let's see what this mysterious missive has to say...
12360: "Deer valyooed kustomer, Thank yoo for choozing Moogle-House, Inc. This deelux domicyle has ben furnishd with an abundense of furst-class acooterments for yoor living lukshury, kupo."
12361: "We are shoore yoo will enjoy yoor stay. Lyke our mottoe sez: Moogle-House--leese it, live it, luv it!" -Kupeliaure
12362: What's that? Oh, Dom Kupeliaure is the MHMU representative in charge of administering all Mog House-related affairs. A most charming and charitable chap, kupo!
12363: That's odd, though... He always struck me as a bit more...literate?
12364: Then again, he is a busy moogle. Contracts to sign, inspections to oversee, deadbeat adventurers to evict... You know how it is, kupo. Perhaps he was just in a hurry?
12365: Anyway, let's take a swift survey of the area, shall we?
12366: Walls...worrisomely worn. Ceiling...categorically crumbling. Floor stones...frighteningly falling apart.
12367: I'm afraid it's just as I feared, kupo. This place needs some serious sprucing up!
12368: First, let's take care of this gaping gash in the ceiling. 6 should do the trick, don't you think?
12369: An adventurer with your mining mastery should be able to find it in a flash, kupo! You wouldn't object to obtaining it for me, would you?
12370: While you're out, I'll take up my tools and get cracking. Happy hunting!
12371: Yes, Master?
12372: I'm all tied up making repairs at the moment. Do forgive me, kupo!
12373: By the way, have you been able to track down that $3 yet? Please, Master! Only you can restore structural soundness to your home sweet home!
12374: By the way, have you been able to track down that $3 yet? Please, Master! Only you can restore structural soundness to your home sweet home!
12375: By the way, have you been able to track down that $3 yet? Please, Master! Only you can restore structural soundness to your home sweet home!
12376: Incredible! What speed! What alacrity! I knew I could count on you, kupo! Now all it'll take is a tippity-tap here, a nudgety-nudge there, and...
12377: There! And sublimely done, if I do say so myself. But no rest for the weary moogle, kupo! To replace these rotting roofboards, we're going to need... Yes, $6 should do the trick.
12378: You should be able to log it somewhere, I think.
12379: Phew! That'll do it. Truly, I'm shocked--stupefied, even--that our union-run Mog Houses are in a state of such disrepair! Something must be done...and soon, kupo!
12380: I know! I'll talk to Dom Kupeliaure!
12381: Knowing him, he'll fix these right up into lavish three-bedroom suites fit for King Kupofried himself! That's just the magnanimous moogle he is, kupo.
12382: Just leave it to me! I'll draft up an official renovation request. Why, we'll be living in the lap of luxury before you know it, kupo!
12383: As for the pressing repairs at hand...
12384: Yes, yes... Why, it looks as if we're just about--
12385: Er--wait one minute. Yes, I...ah...almost forgot. One last piece of material to put on the critical coup-de-grace! A...$3, kupo.
12386: Don't worry. Preoccupied predators are leaving their hard-earned catches all over the place these days. Succulent slabs of meat are literally lying around waiting to be harvested by a keen-eyed adventurer like yourself!
12387: What's that, Master? Why, of course it's required for the repairs! Whatever are you insinuating, kupo!?
12388: I wouldn't dream of roasting it medium-rare, glazed with a delectable dragon-fruit-and-rolanberry sauce, and serving it on a romantic candlelit dinner date with my darling Kupiruru! That's the furthest thing from my innocent moogle mind! Please, Master! You're the only one who can save my romantic prospects--I mean, this dilapidated dwelling, kupo!
12389: ...and that should do it! Feast your eyes on this craftsmanship, Master! The precision! The perfection! Not a single bent nail! Not a single warped plank!
12390: And I couldn't have done it without you, Master. Thank you from the bottom of my ever-humble moogle heart, kupo!
12391: Oh, hello, what do have we here? A letter? Aha! This must be a reply from the boss!
12392: Always quick with a cordial reply, that Dom Kupeliaure! Let's see what manner of ritzy renovations he has in store for us, kupo.
12393: "Full-scayle renohvashuns, yoo say? The impyoodence! The awdassity! Yoov got sum nurve making damands lyke that when yoor not payeing a singul gil in rent!
12394: "That duz it. Yoo no like tha Mog Howse? Fyne. Yoo kan pack yor bags and leev the premasis--effektiv immeediotly, yoo wurthles, free-loding advenchurer.
12395: "Down't lett tha squeeky dore hit yoo in yore behynd on tha way owt. -Kupeliaure P.S. to that bungleing moogle attendunt--YOR FYRED."
12396: .................. ............... ...
12397: Oh dear. It would seem that the boss is a bit--how shall we say--miffed?
12398: How odd... He was always such an affable chap. Could the stress of dealing with disgruntled boarders be getting to him in his advanced age, kupo?
12399: <Sigh> It seems we have a sticky situation on our hands... Whatever shall we do?
12400: What's this, kupo? There's a message scrawled at the bottom here...
12401: "Be warned, ye laggard loafers most perverse... This envelope has been ensorcelled with a fearsome curse!
12402: "Breaking the seal will release malicious spirits into the air. So do be wary, and handle with care! O`hohohohohoho!"
12403: O`hohoho...? Now where have I heard that bef--
12404: Wh-what's happening!? What is that clattering? That shattering? These footsteps a-pattering, and blood a-spattering!?
12405: Oh, M-Master! We're doomed! Done for! Deader than a rain-rusted doornail, kupoooooo...
12406: <Cough>...Ahem. I seem to have contracted a case of the shivers, so I think I'll step outside for a bit.
12407: Frightened? Me? Perish the thought, kupo! You must have mistaken me for some other moogle malingerer! Now, if you'll just--<ahem>--excuse me for a moment.
12408: Kupo-wh-whoa!?
12409: Er... Let's try that once more...with feeling, kupo!
12410: Kupooooooooo...it's no use. I'm trapped!
12411: It must be the curse... What manner of twisted, sadistic mind could have devised such a sinister spell?
12412: Oh Master, whatever shall we do, kupoooooo...
12413: Hmm? What's this? A mysterious message mystically aglow atop the parchment?
12414: Could it be...?
12415: "For curses, hexes, and jinxes, big and small... visit Shantotto's Exorcism Emporium--she'll banish them all!
12416: "That's Professor Shantotto's one-stop curse-removal shop! With a discount for first-time customers--now there's an offer you can't top!"
12417: Kupo...?
12418: I can't help but feel that something is...amiss, kupo.
12419: But we have no choice!
12420: I beg of you, Master! You must go to Windurst and speak with Professor Shantotto!
12421: Why, if you don't, I'll never be able to leave this house again! My romantic dinner plans with Kupiruru will be ruined! Ruined, kupo!
12422: You wouldn't consign your bestest bat-winged buddy to such a forlorn fate, would you? ...Would you, Master!?
12423: Oh, and Master, do be careful if you visit any other Mog Houses or Rent-a-Rooms! You may see moogles that look like me, but you never know what awful apparitions they might actually be...
12424: Tarry too long, and you just might find yourself curse-stricken as well! So please, hurry to Professor Shantotto without delay! You're this poor moogle's only hope, kupoooooo...
12425: 
12426: What will you do? [<Sigh>./Fine, kupo.]
12427: Oh Master, thank heavens you've returned! Every second I spend in this Goddess-forsaken hovel is giving me the heebie-jeebies, kupo!
12428: Did you speak with the Professor? Will she help us, kupo?
12429: Shantotto has arrived to answer your call! There's a curse to be lifted--no time to stall!
12430: Oh yes, there can be no doubt. This hex packs some serious clout.
12431: But with my prodigious powers, 'tis a trifling matter. A simple counterspell to send these spirits a-scatter.
12432: O`hohoho!
12433: tGhosts and demons, go away... @Don't come back another day!t
12434: Now, begone, I say!
12435: Er, is that all, Professor? That was awfully quick, kupo...
12436: (Is that really so surprising? After all, 'twas a curse of my own dev--)
12437: <Ahem>! That is to say--yes, the deed is done!
12438: The jinx is no more, the day is won!
12439: I'll just be on my way now... Ta-ta, have fun! O`hohoho!
12440: Ever a curious character, that Professor Shantotto... But no matter! The curse is lifted, oh joy of joyous joys!
12441: I am once again free to flutter about to my heart's content! Oh, Kupiruru, my darling, how I've missed you, kupo! Thank you ever, ever so much, Master!
12442: But still...we must do something about Dom Kupeliaure and that curious eviction notice. After all, without my job, how will I be able to afford Kupiruru's engagement ring!? We must act now, kupo!
12443: In fact, I think I'll float by the boss's place right now and see just what in the world is the matter.
12444: After all, it just isn't like him to fly off the handle like that, kupo. He's always been as gentle as a goobbue!
12445: You just sit tight, Master. I'll have this whole mess straightened up before you can say Jaggedy-Eared Jack!
12446: Kupow-ow-ow, that smarts...
12447: What's the big idea, eh!? I paid good gil for that curse! You think you can just up and dispect...despeckle...un-cursify it like that!?
12448: Why, you...you're not the boss!
12449: Master, this is Toto Kupeliaure! The boss's scofflaw son--a real troublemaker whose arrogance and ambition is exceeded only by his inability to form an intelligible utterance!
12450: What's the meaning of this, kupo!?
12451: Yeah, I'm Toto, all right! What's it to ya!?
12452: The old man's on an expended leave of abscess, so I've taken control of the family biz in his place! You gots a problem with that, you take it up with the management--oh wait, that's me! Bwahahaha!
12453: Y-you mean that that eviction notice...me being fired... That was all your doing, kupo!?
12454: Yeah, I can see that you're as sharp as a...as a... ...Something that ain't too sharp.
12455: That's right. Dear ol' dad is gettin' on in years, so I figured it's time for some fresh blood. A new corpulent strategery, if ya catch my drift.
12456: But this is fraud! Flimflam, kupo! You don't have the authority! We had a contract written and signed by...!
12457: ...Kupeliaure...?
12458: Don't see the old man's name nowhere on there, now, don't ya?
12459: Hah! You couldn't even tell by all those big, edjumacated words I used? You really are dumber than a rocks o' box.
12460: Listen up, cause I ain't gonna say this once. I was gettin' sick of waitin' around for dear ol' pop to hand the company down to my oh-so-brillulent self.
12461: So I says to myself, "Self, mebbe you can get the old man to take some much-needed rext and relastation. Then you can gets a head-start on being decider-in-chief."
12462: What a ridiculous plan, kupo!
12463: Hey, don't look at me. After all, who's the bigger fool? The fool, or...or the guy who's the bigger fool?
12464: Anyhoo, that was my plan. And a darn good one, if I don't not say so myself. Startin' right here at this Room-a-Rent, one by one I'd turn these Mog Houses into a comm-traversial service.
12465: Y'know...one that ya gots to pay for.
12466: Then you come in demanding all these repairs and reprobations...hah! What kind of a chump d'ya take me for?
12467: Listen, bozos--I shawl the cots around here. As of right now, all Mog Houses are stay-to-pay. You stay? You pay!
12468: And that's actro-retrive. Adding in unpaid fees from the previous oppucants, with accubulated interest...
12469: That comes to...lessee here... Eleventy-five thousand, eight hojillion and two gils. Payable immedulately. That means "now."
12470: What!?
12471: Are you out of your noggin, kupo!? We don't have that kind of money!
12472: ...Hm?
12473: Sorry, I musta mis-underheard you just now. 'Coz I coulda sworn you just said you ain't got the gils.
12474: But that couldn't be, 'coz that would mean your account was in our-ears. That's bidness lingo for "overdue."
12475: And that would mean your deadbeat butts would be out on the street. Like, now, y'see.
12476: So I'll do ya's a favor and dis-remember this conversation.
12477: And if you're thinkin' dear old dad is gonna come back to rescu-fy your lousy behinds, you've got another think comin'!
12478: Yeah, I think his one-way luxury cruise to Tavnazia will be keepin' him busy for the foreseeifcating future.
12479: <Gulp>, kupo.
12480: But ya don't gots to worry.
12481: After all, I hear them Trolls are leasin' out caves in Halvung at very reasonable rates these days. Bwahahaha!
12482: That Toto! I'd heard what a reprobate ruffian he was, but this is ridiculous even for him!
12483: Time and again, the Kupeliaure family has tried to impress upon him the importance of honest business, but nothing gets through that thick skull of his.
12484: Oh, Master, whatever shall we do!? How can we scare up such a sizable sum of cash, kupo?
12485: Unless--no...no, I couldn't! It's absolutely, kupositively out of the question! But...but...
12486: Master, listen. I want to you to retrieve my buried moggy bank.
12487: <Sigh> Oh, how I was hoping it wouldn't come to this!
12488: The hard-earned gil I saved for my honeymoon with my dearest, darling Kupiruru! Hours of hard labor in the name of love down the drain, kupo!
12489: Oh, the agony! Oh, how it pains my tender moogle heart! But we have no choice, kupo...
12490: I beg of you, Master. You must hop on your chocobo, make your way for [La Theine Plateau/Valkurm Dunes/Jugner Forest/Konschtat Highlands/Pashhow Marshlands/Tahrongi Canyon/Buburimu Peninsula/Meriphataud Mountains/The Sanctuary of Zi'Tah/Yuhtunga Jungle/Yhoator Jungle/Western Altepa Desert/Eastern Altepa Desert], and dig up my nest egg, kupo.
12491: We shall pay that thuggardly Toto his money! But don't worry, Master! The boss will set everything straight when he returns.
12492: In fact, I'll try to track him down while you're away, kupo!
12493: Oh, and Master. Not to be mistrustful, but...don't even think of helping yourself to my secret savings. I've got my cash counted down to the last beastcoin, kupo!
12494: $P11`%q$P11I$P11p [<Player>j%q/$P13q%q]
12495: Well, Master? Did you find my secret moggy bank?
12496: Oh yes! That's it! Without a doubt, kupo!
12497: Ah...my hard-earned fortune!
12498: Hour upon backbreaking hour spent shoveling buffalo dung, with only the thought of a felicitous future with my fair Kupiruru to keep my spirits high...
12499: If you will, Master, just allow this poor moogle to count his fortune one last time before saying goodbye... One, two, three...kupo...
12500: Six hundred and thirty...six hundred and thirty-one... Ah, er... Six hundred and thirty-two gil.
12501: What with the MHMU in the red these days, it would seem our wages aren't what they used to be...
12502: I'm afraid this means we're still a smidgen short on funds, kupo.
12503: Oh, Master, is there no end to our misfortunes? Whatever shall we do now, kupoooooo...?
12504: Unless... No! Anyone...anything but...him!
12505: No siree! I promised my moogle mommy that no matter how rough things got, I would never--
12506: ...Never ever...!
12507: ...Never, ever, ever...!
12508: ...Stoop to that, kupo!
12509: But desperate times make for desperate moogles. Yes, Master, I fear that we have but one option at our disposal!
12510: Riko Kupenreich...the slipperiest, shadiest, shiftiest, scheming-est moneylender in all of Vana'diel, kupo!
12511: ...And the only one who would lend us what we need without demanding all our worldly possessions as collateral.
12512: I've been lucky to never have dealt with him before, but word has it that he's got a deep grudge against the Kupeliaure family, kupo. That he resents them for running a successful, upstanding business while he's left to skulk in the shadows...
12513: Riko peddles his trade in the murky depths of Sea Serpent Grotto. I hoped this day would never come, but business is business...and he's the only one who can help us now, kupo. Do take care, Master!
12514: Oh, Master, there you are! Did Riko approve our loan?
12515: Superb! Spectacular! Splendiferous! I just knew you could do it, kupo!
12516: Now just a few flaps of the ol' wings to Toto's place, and...
12517: Not so fast. Where you think you going, runt?
12518: What!? Step aside, foul fiends! Just who do you think you are?
12519: Us? We just Toto's little friends...come to collect cash from you deadbeats.
12520: Let see here... Eight billion eleventy gazillion, four hundred fifty-five hojillion and two gil.
12521: What!? That's nearly twice the sum Toto asked for!
12522: Oh ho. You a funny moogle, you are. Guess you never hear of little something we call..."interest."
12523: So I give you econo-monics lesson for dummies. You lazy loafer no pay your debts? The money add up.
12524: Every day...
12525: Every hour...
12526: Every minute...
12527: Every second.
12528: Your debt get bigger and bigger and bigger...like bomb about to blow! Har har har!
12529: This is patently preposterous, kupo! We've only prepared the amount we were asked for!
12530: So you saying you no can pay, eh!?
12531: Good thing Toto such reasonable guy. You just sign right here, and all problem go away.
12532: What in the world is this, kupo!?
12533: "Master Toto, Eye am a nincompewp and a ne'er-do-well. I here-bye promise to vacu-ate this prop-tery within a week and re-licorish all future income to you until--"
12534: Long story short, this what we in da business call "a contract to get your deadbeat butts outta here."
12535: You're out of your bestial brains, kupo! Why should an upstanding moogle such as myself have to leave my own Mog House!?
12536: This whole rent business is just a crock cooked up by that crook Toto! He has no authority here!
12537: Oh, you think you tough guy, huh? Guess we have to do this hard way.
12538: We just happen to have special visitor back at office. Sweet little girl...with cute little tail and wings.
12539: Maybe you know her? Har har har!
12540: Why, you slimy, sordid--! What have you done to her, kupo!?
12541: If you lay even one feral finger on my Kupiruru, why I'll--
12542: You still no understand? This business. Like Toto say, you no get something for nothing.
12543: You and this deadbeat adventurer buddy-buddies, right? [He/She] no pay bills, you both pay price.
12544: You in luck, though. See, Toto is nice boss.
12545: You swear life of unpaid servitude at his new Masquerade Mog House, maybe he work you out deal.
12546: (Ooh, Master! I've always wanted to be an actor, kupo!)
12547: <Ahem>...I mean, absolutely out of the question! Begone before my master wipes this freshly polished floor with your worthless hides, kupo!
12548: Har har har! You funny. Anyway, you know deal now, so my job done. You want save girl, you sign contract, bring to Chamber of Oracles. ...Or else! Har har har!
12549: Oh Master, whatever shall we do? Is there no end to a moogle's miserable luck?
12550: I won't--I can't leave this Mog House behind! But just the thought of my poor Kupiruru, forlorn and forsaken deep within the den of those despicable brutes...
12551: It's enough to move a poor moogle to tears... Would that I could flee this flimsy coop and fly to her side this instant! But alas...my contract with the MHMU keeps me pinned here to my post, kupoooooo...
12552: Oh, Master! You'll save her, won't you?
12553: The greatest love story in the history of mooglekind cannot--must not--end like this!
12554: Fret not your fair heart, my dearest! My Master is coming to save you, kupo!
12555: Welcome home, Master!
12556: Oh, how can I ever repay you for saving my dearest Kupiruru? Thank you, Master, thank you!
12557: Now the greatest love story in moogle history can go on! We've already decided to go back to the Chamber of Oracles on our next date, kupo!
12558: But hmm... How do you suppose Toto will react to our thorough thrashing of his toadies?
12559: Kupo-oh? What have we here?
12560: It's a letter from Toto, Master! Whatever might it say? My heart is positively palpitating!
12561: Let's see here, kupo...
12562: "To my ensteamed clients, My heart-filled apologies for this most terrible dis-understanding.
12563: "But let's let bygones be things that have gone by. A bridge under water, as they say.
12564: "As a token of my benevol-osity, I'd like to invite you to be the guests of honor at a spectacularrific Mog Festival!
12565: "To be held at scenic Castle Zvahl, we'll be holding a Mega Mog Bonanza-Rama-Palooza featuring extortionate prizes, plus a virtual copa-cornia of exciting events!
12566: "It just wouldn't be the same without your attend-ification, so do stop by! Your bestest pal, Toto Kupeliaure"
12567: Can you believe it, Master? A festival, kupo!
12568: I knew that Toto wasn't such a bad kid after all, kupo! He's clearly seen the error of his ways.
12569: A festival, Master, a festival! With a Mega Mog Bonanza-Rama-Palooza to boot, kupo! Could there be a happier ending to this mess? Though I must say he's picked a curious venue...
12570: But no matter! We mustn't let the festivities begin without us! To Castle Zvahl, kupo!
12571: Press any button to continue.
12572: Greetings, friend! I am a synergy engineer, dispatched from the Institute to maintain the furnaces you see beside me. I also have knowledge and services to share with fellow synergists, if that is what you desire.
12573: I see from the puzzled expression on your face that you are unfamiliar with our discipline. To use these furnaces, you will first need to obtain $6.
12574: Piqued your curiosity, have I? Then you should speak with Hildolf, our institute director, at his laboratory in the Bastok Metalworks. He's always eager to welcome a new synergist to our ranks.
12575: May I be of service? [Not now./Learn recipes./Check fewell./Replenish fewell./Purchase materials./Receive training./Trade cinder./Get information.]

12597: There you go. That doesn't sound so hard, now, does it?
12598: But of course! If you'll just allow me to inspect your $3 for a moment...
12599: Your fewell supply would appear to be as follows: o o $1 o!$2 o"$3 o#$4 o$$5 o%$6 o&$7.
12600: Running low? We can fill you up for a nominal fee.
12601: Replenish fewell? [Yes./No.]
12602: Looking for a fewell fill-up, you say? Then you've come to the right place!
12603: ...Hm? Why, your tank is already full to bursting. Come back again if you need a refill.
12604: Now let's see here... According to my calculations, I can fill you up to capacity for $0 gil. How does that sound?
12605: Pay $0 gil? [Deal!/No thanks.]
12606: Understood. Take care to monitor your reserves closely, lest you run out of fewell in the midst of a crucial procedure.
12607: I'm afraid you haven't the requisite gil, friend. Perhaps another time.
12608: Excellent! Now we just pop open your $3 here, and...
12609: There you go. Filled to the brim with a fresh batch of fewell! Can you smell those fumes? Mmm-mmm!
12610: Your $3 has been filled to capacity!
12611: You hand the synergy engineer $0 gil.
12612: How do you expect me to do that when your $3 is sitting inside a furnace, friend? You'll have to come back after you've finished synergizing.
12613: Materials, you say? But of course! Have a look at our selection.
12614: Purchase something? [Not today./$1 $0 : $2 gil./$3 $0 : $4 gil./$5 $0 : $6 gil.]
12615: For $1 $0 , that comes to $2 gil.
12616: Ah, another dedicated synergist looking to refine [his/her] technique. Excellent! That motivation will serve you well.
12617: ...But I'm afraid you'll need [/ever so slightly more/a bit more/more/a good deal more/considerably more] experience before you're ready to benefit from my training.
12618: And yes, it would seem you're at just the right skill level to receive my training. So, what will it be? Which technique would you like to improve?
12619: Train in which technique? [Cancel./Fewell feeding. (Current Lv.: $0)/Furnace thwacking. (Current Lv.: $1)/Pressure handle. (Current Lv.: $2)/Safety lever. (Current Lv.: $3)/Furnace repair. (Current Lv.: $4)/Fewell recycling. (Current Lv.: $5)]
12620: You wish to improve your [/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique. Is this correct?
12621: It would seem your [/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique already exceeds my own. There is no more I can teach you.
12622: Train in this technique? [Yes./No.]
12623: Very well! Now listen up, watch closely, and try to follow along...
12624: ...See, you take this part here, and... Yes, yes...just like that...
12625: ...Now steady here, or you'll be picking exploded furnace shrapnel out of your face for a week! Phew, that was a close one...
12626: ...And by applying Corollary Five of Hildolf's Third Theory of Inverse Transfocal Equilibrium, we find that...
12627: <Clink, clank...clunk> ...Er, let's try that once more...
12628: ...Superb! A quick learner, I see. If only all my students were as attentive as you!
12629: Your [/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique increases to level $1!
12630: Research into the composition of the cinder produced as a side effect of synergy just might lead to the next breakthrough in our field. Provide us with samples for analysis, and we will gladly reward your contributions.
12631: Trade in your cinder? (Currently: $0 Pz) [Not now./$1: $2 Pz./$3: $4 Pz./$5: $6 Pz./$7: $8 Pz./$9: $10 Pz./$11: $12 Pz./$13: $14 Pz./$15 gil: $16 Pz.]
12632: This is what you want, correct?
12633: Make the exchange? [Yes./No.]
12634: It would appear that you lack the necessary quantity of cinder for that transaction.
12635: Excellent! And this is yours. May it serve you well!
12636: You transferred $0 Pz of cinder to the synergy engineer. $1 Pz [remains/remain] in your possession.
12637: Ask about what? [Nothing./Synergy furnaces./Synergy overview./Synergy procedure./Synergy recipes./Fewell replenishment./Materials for sale./Synergy techniques./Trading cinder.]
12638: The synergy furnaces you see around town are provided as a public service by the Bastokan Institute of Synergy Research, to ensure that no synergist is ever far away from the tools of their trade.
12639: The synergist must provide his or her own $3, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process. Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.
12640: Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.
12641: Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town. If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.
12642: You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis. It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.
12643: Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results. The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.
12644: This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call "fewell." To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!
12645: As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require. Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.
12646: With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing! Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.
12647: The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be. In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!
12648: But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.
12649: If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.
12650: Take heart, though, as any materials inside your $3 will remain intact. You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.
12651: Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.
12652: Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.
12653: Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions. Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!
12654: You may be asking yourself, "Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?"
12655: Here's the good news: you don't have to! For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.
12656: The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand. At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.
12657: Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of $0, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.
12658: Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that $0 may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.
12659: Mind you, $0 is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it. Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.
12660: Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped. May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!
12661: First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply. You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.
12662: You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe. Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.
12663: Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy. If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.
12664: You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically. Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.
12665: From here, it becomes a race against the clock! Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.
12666: Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task. First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.
12667: Next, you can begin to feed fewell into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration. Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.
12668: However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions. Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.
12669: If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you'll want to employ the safety lever and pressure handle to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.
12670: You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition. Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.
12671: The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues. You'll need to perform periodic furnace repair should the furnace near its breaking point.
12672: It is also possible to recycle strewn fewell during synergy. While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.
12673: This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute. As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.
12674: As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable. There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.
12675: For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger. Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!
12676: You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.
12677: In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well. To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.
12678: Now let us return to the synergy process itself. As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.
12679: If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance. The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.
12680: Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills! Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...
12681: What's an elemental surge, you ask? Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.
12682: The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?
12683: ...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell. There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.
12684: Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe. We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.
12685: Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients. There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.
12686: Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.
12687: The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own. The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.
12688: In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as $0 can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.
12689: # cannot be attached directly. First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of $0 can then be embedded.
12690: The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment. There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.
12691: If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.
12692: As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.
12693: You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures. It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.
12694: Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant. Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.
12695: My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale. The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!
12696: The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.
12697: Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach. Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.
12698: To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.
12699: When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.
12700: Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call revertant.
12701: Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state! Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.
12702: As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call "fewell." The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.
12703: Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.
12704: To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!
12705: For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.
12706: That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your $3! What could be easier?
12707: Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of $0? If so, you've come to the right place!
12708: We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as mordant for sale. With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.
12709: Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff. You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.
12710: Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant. As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.
12711: Ah, synergy techniques! Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.
12712: My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques. We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.
12713: Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge. For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.
12714: Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents. You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.
12715: Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer. These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.
12716: The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills. To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.
12717: Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.
12718: Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation. Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.
12719: We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.
12720: It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold! Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.
12721: Wondering if your $0 can be outfitted with evolith, are you? Well, you've come to the right place!
12722: A quick look at its composition should tell us all we need to know. Let's see here...
12723: Congratulations! Your $0 can indeed hold [an/another] evolith aperture. A $2-shaped aperture, to be exact...
12724: ...Suitable for evolith of the following size and elemental affinity: Maximum size: $1 / [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&].
12725: ...Suitable for evolith of the following sizes and elemental affinities: Maximum size: $1 / Affinity: [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&]. Maximum size: $3 / Affinity: [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&].
12726: ...Suitable for evolith of the following sizes and elemental affinities: Maximum size: $1 / Affinity: [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&]. Maximum size: $3 / Affinity: [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&]. Maximum size: $5 / Affinity: [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&].
12727: ...Suitable for evolith of the following sizes and elemental affinities: Maximum size: $1 / Affinity: [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&]. Maximum size: $3 / Affinity: [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&]. Maximum size: $5 / Affinity: [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&]. Maximum size: $7 / Affinity: [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&].
12728: That is all. Should you wish to have any other pieces of equipment analyzed, you know where to find us.
12729: Hmm... I'm afraid your $0 cannot house any more apertures.
12730: ...Alas. It's a shame, but it appears your $0 cannot be etched.
12731: Hmm, what's this? It would seem that your $0 cannot be etched at this time.
12732: Do you love synergizing as much as I love synergizing!? 'Cause if you do, you're gonna loooooove the recipes I have for you!

12736: Oh, the $0? Why, that's one of my favorite recipes, too! What skills does it require? Let's see here...
12737: Well, look at this. All you need is a furnace and your own Goddess-given synergy skills to make that one! Ain't synergy grand?
12738: Wait! No, don't tell me. You strike me as a [man/woman] who's looking to learn a thing or two about synergy.
12739: Learn about synergy? [Not today./Teach me!/Just give me $6.]
12740: A life without intellectual curiosity is a life hardly worth living. Should your eyes one day open to this truth, you are free to return.
12741: I thought you'd never ask! Synergy is both an art and a science: an evolution--nay, a revolution--in synthesis.
12742: Using $6 in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.
12743: What we call $6 serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.
12744: Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists. The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.
12745: Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your $3 into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.
12746: Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.
12747: Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium. The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.
12748: You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.
12749: But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.
12750: A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.
12751: That's why smart synergists synergize in numbers. Too many culinarians might spoil the broth, but when it comes to synergy, it's the more the merrier!
12752: An aspiring synergist, I see! If you're looking for $6, you've certainly come to the right place.
12753: I can sell you a splendid entry-level model for $0 gil. A small price to pay to embark on a lifelong journey of scientific discovery, wouldn't you say?
12754: $0 gil, paid in full!
12755: As promised, here's your $3. And because I like your enthusiasm, I've even stocked it to the brim with fewell for you! How's that for a deal?
12756: The synergist must provide his or her own $3, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process. Synergy furnaces themselves may be used free of charge.
12757: Should you wish to learn more about the science of synergy, seek out one of the engineers stationed throughout the town.
12758: Greetings, good [sir/madam]. What ails you this day?
12759: Hm? A spirited lass of Hume and Elvaan heritage, crowned with fiery red hair?
12760: I fear I've not had the pleasure of her acquaintance. I assure you, I'd not soon forget a meeting with such an intriguing lady.
12761: Sir Ragelise? Ah, yes, as great a knight as there ever was.
12762: 'Twas not long after the war that he came to Jeuno, seeking treatment. Alas, the Duchy had been reduced to a ruin and wanted for facilities.
12763: I was but a child back then, interned to this infirmary, but it pained me still that naught could be done to save Sir Ragelise.
12764: ...
12765: What? You wish to cure a friend of the same affliction as ailed Sir Ragelise?
12766: Much time has passed since the war's end, 'tis true, yet modern medicine is no closer to finding a cure for that malady.
12767: No other cases were known to exist, you see, and research on the condition had stalled before it even began.
12768: A supposition has, however, crossed my mind a number of times. What if this affliction weren't a simple illness of the flesh as first thought, but something spawned of sorcery? A curse, as it were?
12769: Should any knowledge exist pertaining to it, I would stake that it can be found at the Optistery in Windurst.
12770: Countless tomes--veritable goldmines of knowledge--are said to have survived the fires of war. I'd love naught more than to pore through them with mine own eyes, but for my responsibilities which keep me here in the Duchy.
12771: Fellow Limit Break $0 quest offered.
12772: Fellow Limit Break $0 quest cleared.
12773: You cannot undertake the next task with the $0 in your possession. Please dispose of it and try again.
12774: ...Wait. There was just one thing. Do you rrrecall your showdown at the Qu'Bia Arena?
12775: You know, the one where you and [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji] squared off in a hair-rrraising duel of epic proportions?
12776: You know, the one where you and [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde] squared off in a hair-rrraising duel of epic proportions?
12777: You know, the one where you and [Chanandit/Deulmaeux/Demresinaux/Ephealgaux/Gauldeval/Grauffemart/Migaifongut/Romidiant] squared off in a hair-rrraising duel of epic proportions?

12781: You know, the one where you and [Fhig Lahrv/Khuma Tagyawhan/Pimy Kettihl/Raka Maimhov/Sahyu Banjyao/Sufhi Uchnouma/Tsuim Nhomango/Yoli Kohlpaka] squared off in a hair-rrraising duel of epic proportions?
12782: You know, the one where you and [Durib/Dzapiwa/Jugowa/Mugido/Voldai/Wagwei/Zayag/Zoldof] squared off in a hair-rrraising duel of epic proportions?
12783: What of it, you say?
12784: Perhaps it's all water under Heavens Brrridge to you, but your sidekick hasn't been the same since. Yes, it would seem the walloping you delivered left quite a mark.
12785: Moping all day like the end of the world is nigh, bumbling and fumbling through one job after the next... I turned a blind eye till now, but it's starting to cut into my profits!
12786: Yep, someone's going to have to take rrresponsibility. ...And when I say "someone," I mean you.
12787: Proper aftercare...it's an indispensible part of the fellowship process! Are we understood?
12788: So here's the long and short of it. Ever since his defeat at Qu'Bia, poor [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji] has been plagued with self-doubt at the thought that his abilities have reached their limits.

12796: ...A plight not unfamiliar to an adventurer such as you, I'd rrreckon. So I'm counting on you to help your buddy through the same way you helped yourself.
12797: I have here an invitation from an organization called the Magian Mooglehood. Have you heard of them, by any chance?
12798: You better have, because they're asking that you show up in Ru'Lude Garrrdens with something called $6 in hand.
12799: Either way, it shouldn't prove a difficult task for one as capable as you.
12800: Show this to the Magian Moogle when you get there, and he'll take care of the rrrest.
12801: Next time [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji] comes moping through here, I'll tell him to meet you in Ru'Lude posthaste.
12802: Next time [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde] comes moping through here, I'll tell her to meet you in Ru'Lude posthaste.

12808: Next time [Durib/Dzapiwa/Jugowa/Mugido/Voldai/Wagwei/Zayag/Zoldof] comes moping through here, I'll tell him to meet you in Ru'Lude posthaste.
12809: I can see it now--the two of you forging bonds of comrrradeship as never before! And I'll be right there looking on, heart overflowing with joy and coffers overflowing with gil. So what are you waiting for, <Player>? Get a move on!
12810: Why, [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji], you're back. And walking with quite the sprrring in your step, I must say!
12811: Why, [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde], you're back. And walking with quite the sprrring in your step, I must say!
12812: Why, [Chanandit/Deulmaeux/Demresinaux/Ephealgaux/Gauldeval/Grauffemart/Migaifongut/Romidiant], you're back. And walking with quite the sprrring in your step, I must say!
12813: Why, [Armittie/Cadepure/Clearite/Epilleve/Liabelle/Nauthima/Radille/Vimechue], you're back. And walking with quite the sprrring in your step, I must say!
12814: Why, [Balu-Falu/Burg-Ladarg/Ehgo-Ryuhgo/Kolui-Pelui/Nokum-Akkum/Savul-Kivul/Vinja-Kanja/Yarga-Umiga], you're back. And walking with quite the sprrring in your step, I must say!

12817: Why, [Durib/Dzapiwa/Jugowa/Mugido/Voldai/Wagwei/Zayag/Zoldof], you're back. And walking with quite the sprrring in your step, I must say!
12818: Why, perhaps I am. And it's thanks to you and <Player> here.
12819: Bwahaha! So you've noticed? And I've got you and <Player> here to thank for it all!
12820: Is that so? I don't believe my appearance has changed much. Still, I do owe you and <Player> a debt of gratitude.
12821: I thank you, Luto. It's because of you and <Player> that I stand before you as I do.
12822: Aw gee, Luto, you're making me blush. I feel great, and it's thanks to swell friends like you and <Player> here.
12823: Ever the sharp eye, my dear Luto! I'm a new man, and it's thanks to you and <Player> here.
12824: Do I truly? If so, I have you and <Player> here to thank.
12825: You bet I do! And it's all 'cause of you and <Player> here.
12826: It's kind of you to notice. Truly, I owe it all to you and <Player> here.
12827: Awww, Luto, you're making me blush. You and <Player> here really are the bestest!
12828: Thank you, Luto. I am filled with confidence as I have never known, and I owe it all to you and <Player> here.
12829: Ohoho...why yes, you could say that. It seems I owe the two of you a debt of gratitude.
12830: Well, look who's all polite and proper now. Just the other day you were grrrumping and brooding like a Tonberry with a butter knife!
12831: Hmph...
12832: You wound me, Luto! Why, I never...
12833: <Ahem>... That sounds most unlike me. Perhaps you mistook me for another?
12834: Luto... You promised not to speak of such things.
12835: Aww, come on, Luto! Cut me some slack, will ya?
12836: Ouch! That's a real dagger in the heart coming from you, Luto.
12837: N-nonsense! I would never, ever act in such a disgraceful manner!
12838: L-Luto! I thought we agreed not to talk about that in front of <Player> here!
12839: Why, perhaps I did. Fortunately, that is all in the past now.
12840: Wh-why Luto, you meanie! You promised me you'd keep that a secret!
12841: I will not deny it. Even I have my moments of weakness...
12842: Wh-why, I never! How dare you spout such utter falsehoods about me!
12843: At any rate, you might be back in fighting trim again, but my business here isn't so lucky. It's going to take time to earn back our customers' trrrust after those antics you pulled.
12844: ...
12845: <G-gulp>... Forgive me!
12846: ...Indeed. For this, I am sorry.
12847: ...My apologies.
12848: I'm really really really sorry, Luto! Please forgive me! Please?
12849: You really know how to twist that knife... My apologies, Luto.
12850: Forgive me.
12851: So sorry!
12852: My apologies. It will not happen again.
12853: Aw, Luto, I'm sorry... I really am!
12854: I am sorry.
12855: Luto...forgive me.
12856: Apology accepted! I'm not going to let you start moping around again after all the trouble <Player> and I went through, believe you me!
12857: Forrrgive and forget, that's my motto! Besides, once our clients catch sight of the new you, it's only a matter of time before work starts piling in again.
12858: I'll keep an eye out for leads here, so in the meantime, why don't you guys get out there and show the world what you can do? I reckon that's the best forrrm of advertising.
12859: And besides, you're adventurers, aren't ya? Just think of all the challenges waiting for you!
12860: Hm. I suppose you're right.
12861: Yes... Yes, of course! I've never been one to back down from a challenge, and I won't start now!
12862: Apt advice, Luto. Yes, I will do as you say.
12863: Understood. I will do everything in my power to regain the trust that I have lost.
12864: All right! Just you watch, Luto. I'll make it up to ya!
12865: A fresh start? I like the sound of that. Just watch me, Luto... I think you'll like what you see.
12866: Why, yes. There is truth in what you say. I shall give it my best.
12867: Leave it to me, Luto! When your clients catch a glimpse of my new skills, you'll have to fight them away!
12868: I thank you, Luto. Your positive attitude is as inspiring as ever.
12869: You just watch me, Luto! I'll make it up to ya a hundred times over!
12870: Luto...I have no words to express my gratitude. Yes, I shall do as you say.
12871: Why, yes. I do believe that a return to the battlefield is just what I need.
12872: Now that's the spirrrit!
12873: Well then, <Player>. Shall we be off?
12874: All right, <Player>! I'd say it's high time we set off on our next adventure!
12875: <Player>. When you are ready to strike forth, you need only say the word.
12876: It's been some time since our last adventure together, <Player>. Let us enjoy this one.
12877: Let's get going, <Player>! I just can't wait to show you my new tricks!
12878: Just look me up when you head out, <Player>. You know I'm always ready to go!
12879: Time waits for no woman, <Player>. I'll go on ahead.
12880: Sounds good to me! Are you ready to go, <Player>?
12881: I eagerly await our next adventure together, <Player>.
12882: You're going to like the new me, <Player>! Just you wait and see!
12883: So, what do you say, <Player>? Shall we be off?
12884: You heard the woman, <Player>! I'll go on ahead, and you'd best not keep me waiting.
12885: Good luck out there, <Player>. [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji] is counting on you, and I am too.
12886: Good luck out there, <Player>. [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde] is counting on you, and I am too.
12887: Good luck out there, <Player>. [Chanandit/Deulmaeux/Demresinaux/Ephealgaux/Gauldeval/Grauffemart/Migaifongut/Romidiant] is counting on you, and I am too.
12888: Good luck out there, <Player>. [Armittie/Cadepure/Clearite/Epilleve/Liabelle/Nauthima/Radille/Vimechue] is counting on you, and I am too.
12889: Good luck out there, <Player>. [Balu-Falu/Burg-Ladarg/Ehgo-Ryuhgo/Kolui-Pelui/Nokum-Akkum/Savul-Kivul/Vinja-Kanja/Yarga-Umiga] is counting on you, and I am too.
12890: Good luck out there, <Player>. [Cupapa/Jajuju/Kalokoko/Mahoyaya/Pakurara/Ripokeke/Yawawa/Yufafa] is counting on you, and I am too.
12891: Good luck out there, <Player>. [Fhig Lahrv/Khuma Tagyawhan/Pimy Kettihl/Raka Maimhov/Sahyu Banjyao/Sufhi Uchnouma/Tsuim Nhomango/Yoli Kohlpaka] is counting on you, and I am too.
12892: Good luck out there, <Player>. [Durib/Dzapiwa/Jugowa/Mugido/Voldai/Wagwei/Zayag/Zoldof] is counting on you, and I am too.
12893: And this is just between you and me, but I've got a hunch that we still haven't seen the best of that one. Our moogle friend was saying the same.
12894: I can't say what trials lie ahead, but I'll be watching the two of you with grrreat interest. Now go get 'em!
12895: Your adventuring fellow's level limit is now [75/80/85/90/99]!
12896: Ah, you're back, <Player>. And your timing couldn't be better!
12897: I just received an invitation from our mutual moogle friend in Ru'Lude bidding you and your cohort to participate in his latest trrrial.
12898: Knowing you, I don't even have to ask if you're up to the task. Am I rrright?
12899: That's what I thought! I'll just hand this right over, then.
12900: To tell the truth, [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji] has been acting a bit rrrestless of late. This should be just what the doctor ordered!

12908: Besides...with business as slow as it is, it's not like I've got any more pressing assignments for the two of you.
12909: I daresay there's no better time for you to focus on your trrraining!
12910: Sure. Whatever you say, Luto.
12911: You heard the woman, <Player>! It's off to the gardens, where our destiny calls!
12912: I could not help but overhear your conversation. Let us take Luto at her word, and venture forth.
12913: Forgive me for eavesdropping, Luto, but I do appreciate your generosity. Let us make the most of this opportunity, <Player>.
12914: Did I hear what I think I heard? I was wondering when the time would come. Let's go get 'em, <Player>!
12915: Like the lady says, <Player>, it's not like we've got anything better to do. Let's take on this challenge in style!
12916: I see. While I would prefer having work to do, it seems we have little choice. Let us head for the gardens, <Player>.
12917: No work still? Sorry, I couldn't help but overhear! How about it, <Player>? Should we do as Luto says?
12918: Forgive me, but I managed to overhear. What do you say, <Player>? It sounds like our course of action is set.
12919: Did ya hear that, <Player>? If there's no work for us, we might as well have some fun!
12920: My apologies for eavesdropping, Luto. I appreciate the offer, and assure you that it will not go wasted.
12921: You heard the woman, did you not, <Player>? It would seem that this leaves us with but one option.
12922: [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji]! Listening in again, were you? Hah, all the better. Saves me the trouble of rrrepeating myself.
12923: [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde]! Listening in again, were you? Hah, all the better. Saves me the trouble of rrrepeating myself.

12928: [Fhig Lahrv/Khuma Tagyawhan/Pimy Kettihl/Raka Maimhov/Sahyu Banjyao/Sufhi Uchnouma/Tsuim Nhomango/Yoli Kohlpaka]! Listening in again, were you? Hah, all the better. Saves me the trouble of rrrepeating myself.
12929: [Durib/Dzapiwa/Jugowa/Mugido/Voldai/Wagwei/Zayag/Zoldof]! Listening in again, were you? Hah, all the better. Saves me the trouble of rrrepeating myself.
12930: <Player> already has everything you'll need. Now go show that moogle what you've got!
12931: I do wonder what surprises he has in store for you this time... Well, I'm sure it's nothing you two can't handle!
12932: Alright, let's mosey.
12933: All right! Let's move out!
12934: Shall we be off?
12935: Let us be on our way.
12936: Alright! Here goes nothing!
12937: Well, <Player>? We mustn't keep our fans waiting.
12938: Let us be off.
12939: All right, let's go go go!
12940: Shall we be on our way, <Player>?
12941: Ta-ta, Luto! See ya later!
12942: Shall we head off?
12943: Let us move, <Player>.
12944: Back so soon, <Player>? Only your second time through, and you're alrrready an old hand!
12945: Hmm? Looking for [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji], are you?
12946: Hmm? Looking for [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde], are you?
12947: Hmm? Looking for [Chanandit/Deulmaeux/Demresinaux/Ephealgaux/Gauldeval/Grauffemart/Migaifongut/Romidiant], are you?
12948: Hmm? Looking for [Armittie/Cadepure/Clearite/Epilleve/Liabelle/Nauthima/Radille/Vimechue], are you?

12950: Hmm? Looking for [Cupapa/Jajuju/Kalokoko/Mahoyaya/Pakurara/Ripokeke/Yawawa/Yufafa], are you?
12951: Hmm? Looking for [Fhig Lahrv/Khuma Tagyawhan/Pimy Kettihl/Raka Maimhov/Sahyu Banjyao/Sufhi Uchnouma/Tsuim Nhomango/Yoli Kohlpaka], are you?
12952: Hmm? Looking for [Durib/Dzapiwa/Jugowa/Mugido/Voldai/Wagwei/Zayag/Zoldof], are you?
12953: Looks like you just missed each other. Too bad, <Player>. You should have seen the sparrrkle in those eyes!
12954: Seems to be relishing that newfound strength. Why, it fills me with pride and joy just to watch.
12955: You'd better watch out. Slack off in your own training, and you might find yourself outstrrripped by your own sidekick.
12956: Take it for what it's worth, <Player>. I just wouldn't want to see a repeat of Qu'Bia, with you on the rrreceiving end. Heh heh!
12957: So what are you waiting for? [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji]'s just itching to strike out on his next adventure!
12958: So what are you waiting for? [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde]'s just itching to strike out on her next adventure!

12961: So what are you waiting for? [Balu-Falu/Burg-Ladarg/Ehgo-Ryuhgo/Kolui-Pelui/Nokum-Akkum/Savul-Kivul/Vinja-Kanja/Yarga-Umiga]'s just itching to strike out on his next adventure!

12964: So what are you waiting for? [Durib/Dzapiwa/Jugowa/Mugido/Voldai/Wagwei/Zayag/Zoldof]'s just itching to strike out on his next adventure!
12965: I know our friend's in good hands with you, <Player>. Now get out there and make me prrroud!
12966: Oh, <Player>. Purrrfect timing as ever. You'll never guess what I have here!
12967: Why, it's another letter from that musty old moogle in Ru'Lude Gardens!
12968: And both you and I know what that means...
12969: ...Again?
12970: Hah hah! And so do I, Luto. So do I!
12971: I was wondering when the next one of those would show up.
12972: Our third trial in tandem awaits us, yes?
12973: Ooh! It's one of those whatchamacallits!
12974: Well, it's about time, I say.
12975: So it has come. And not a moment too soon, I say!
12976: I had a dream last night about another trial, and what do you know!
12977: Would you look at that? I was just thinking of taking a stroll through the gardens.
12978: Oh! Does this mean it's time for another trial in tandewhatsits?
12979: So a new trial awaits us...
12980: Say what you want about that Magian Mooglehood, but I cannot fault their sense of timing.
12981: That's the spirit, [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji]! You should be an old prrro at this by now.
12982: That's the spirit, [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde]! You should be an old prrro at this by now.
12983: That's the spirit, [Chanandit/Deulmaeux/Demresinaux/Ephealgaux/Gauldeval/Grauffemart/Migaifongut/Romidiant]! You should be an old prrro at this by now.
12984: That's the spirit, [Armittie/Cadepure/Clearite/Epilleve/Liabelle/Nauthima/Radille/Vimechue]! You should be an old prrro at this by now.
12985: That's the spirit, [Balu-Falu/Burg-Ladarg/Ehgo-Ryuhgo/Kolui-Pelui/Nokum-Akkum/Savul-Kivul/Vinja-Kanja/Yarga-Umiga]! You should be an old prrro at this by now.
12986: That's the spirit, [Cupapa/Jajuju/Kalokoko/Mahoyaya/Pakurara/Ripokeke/Yawawa/Yufafa]! You should be an old prrro at this by now.
12987: That's the spirit, [Fhig Lahrv/Khuma Tagyawhan/Pimy Kettihl/Raka Maimhov/Sahyu Banjyao/Sufhi Uchnouma/Tsuim Nhomango/Yoli Kohlpaka]! You should be an old prrro at this by now.
12988: That's the spirit, [Durib/Dzapiwa/Jugowa/Mugido/Voldai/Wagwei/Zayag/Zoldof]! You should be an old prrro at this by now.
12989: If you say so. Anyway, I'll go on ahead, <Player>.
12990: You got that right, Luto. Why, I'm so excited, I'm going to head there straight away! See you in the gardens, <Player>!
12991: Well, we mustn't keep our moogle cohort waiting. See you in Ru'Lude, <Player>.
12992: If you'll pardon me, Luto, I shall take my leave. Let us meet at the Ru'Lude Gardens, <Player>.
12993: Well, I've got nothing better to do, so I'll be right on my way! Catch up with you later, <Player>.
12994: Loath as I am to deprive you of the pleasure of my company, Luto, I mustn't keep the moogle waiting. Ciao!
12995: Indeed, Luto. If you will excuse me, I shall head out there straight away.
12996: You know what they say--the early chocobo gets the worm! I'm off, guys!
12997: Well, we might as well avail ourselves of the moogle's generosity. Fare thee well, Luto, and I shall see you in Ru'Lude, <Player>.
12998: Well, time to go-go-go! See ya later, Luto!
12999: Forgive my rudeness, Luto, but I must take my leave. Let us be off, <Player>.
13000: <Player>. Pressing business calls. Ta-ta for now, Luto.
13001: Would you look at that? Off like a cyclone faster than you can say "Aeroga"!
13002: Shouldn't you be on your way as well, <Player>? Wouldn't want to be shown up by your sidekick, after all.
13003: Hm? Do I have any work for you?
13004: I'm afraid not. The only part of my operation going rrright these days is you and your buddy's training.
13005: But hey, for now that's more than enough for me. Keep up your efforts, and things will turn around for us before you know it. I'm counting on you, <Player>!
13006: Finished already? I don't know what this trial of tantrums is all about, but you guys have sure masterrred it!
13007: That's "trial in tandem". T-A-N-D-E-M.
13008: Haha! Ever the witty one, aren't you, Luto? You know as well as we do that it's a trial in "tandem."
13009: That would be "tandem," Luto. Referring to the partnership of <Player> and I, you see?
13010: <Player> and I are throwing no tantrums, Luto. You speak of our trial in "tandem."
13011: Haha! I guess we just have a talent for tantrums, eh <Player>? Hmm? "Tandem?" What does that mean again?
13012: A charming slip of the tongue, dear Luto. It's a trial in "tandem," you know?
13013: That would be "trial in tandem," Luto. I suggest you remember it.
13014: Aw, Luto, you're a cute one! It's trial in "tandem," don't you know.
13015: I believe you mean "trial in tandem," Luto.
13016: Tantra-what? Whatever you wanna call it, I guess we are pretty good!
13017: ...Ahem. I beg your pardon, Luto, but I believe you mean "tandem."
13018: It's trial in "tandem," Luto. I suggest you remember it, lest others think you uncouth.
13019: Hm? Did I misspeak?
13020: Who cares! What matters is that the two of you are back, and positively brimming with vim, vigor, and vitality from the look of it!
13021: Yes. One could say I'm feeling decent enough. I suppose I owe the two of you my thanks.
13022: You don't know the half of it, Luto! I feel like I could take on the world, and it's all thanks to you and <Player>!
13023: I must admit, I'm feeling quite energized. I owe you and <Player> here a debt of gratitude.
13024: It is as if a spring of newfound power wells up from within me. You and <Player> have my sincere gratitude.
13025: I'm in tip-top shape, Luto, and I couldn't have done it without you and <Player> here!
13026: You know it, Luto. There's no feeling finer than that of surpassing your limits, and it's you and <Player> here that have made it possible.
13027: Why, yes, I feel excellent. It's even done wonders for my complexion. How can I ever thank the two of you?
13028: You bet, Luto! These are the days I feel alive, and I owe it all to you and <Player>!
13029: Truly, it's as if I've been reborn. You and <Player> have my deepest gratitude.
13030: Aw, Luto. You sure know how to make a girl feel good about herself! My energy level is off the charts, and I've got you and <Player> to thank for it!
13031: I do not exaggerate when I say that it is as if I am ten times the woman I was. How can I ever repay the two of you?
13032: Why, yes. These trials have got my blood stirring as nothing before. I owe much to this Magian Mooglehood...and the two of you, I suppose.
13033: Don't mention it! Nothing pleases me more than being able to perform a favor for my frrriends.
13034: ...But hey, that's all I can do for today. Business just isn't what it used to be, I'm afraid.
13035: Oh well, then. You know where to find me if you need me, <Player>. I...look forward to our next adventure together.
13036: Truly a shame! And here I was ready to set right off on my next assignment. Fortunately, <Player> and I still have many adventures ahead! Isn't that right, my friend?
13037: Alas, but there is nothing to be done. Well, <Player>. When you next feel the call of adventure, you know where to find me.
13038: I suppose I cannot complain, as it is a plight I brought upon myself. Well, <Player>, shall we go adventuring in the meantime?
13039: Aw man, what a bummer! Why don't we take our frustrations out on some nasty fiends, <Player>?
13040: Let's not let the rough times get us down, <Player>. Adventure calls, and like a lady, we'd best not keep her waiting!
13041: ...I see. Well, <Player>, it would seem this is as good a time as any for our next adventure. What do you say?
13042: Yikes! That's a shame. Good thing there's still plenty of adventures out there to be had! Right, <Player>?
13043: These must be difficult times indeed. Still, as long as <Player> and I are together, we can find our own adventure. Is that not so?
13044: Aw, Luto, that's really too bad! Well, <Player>, why don't we cheer ourselves up with an adventure or two?
13045: Well, <Player>, it would seem there is nothing for us to do but go in search of our own adventure. Shall we be off?
13046: Then I bid you farewell for now, Luto. And you, <Player>. I thirst for adventure, and I trust that you will answer the call.
13047: ...That unflagging adventurer's spirit. Nearly brrrings a tear to my eye, it does.
13048: Well, what are you waiting for? Haven't you realized that you're a [man/woman] in demand? Ahahaha!
13049: Hail, soldier. I am a purveyor tasked with furnishing the brave men and women of the Voidwatch with essential supplies. My wares can be yours, provided you've got [Conquest Points/Imperial Standing/Allied Notes] to trade. After all, we can't afford to let our limited resources go to waste in the hands of some unproven rookie.
13050: Procure supplies? ([Points/Standing/Notes]: $1) [Not now./$2 ($3)./$4 ($5)./$6 ($7)./$8 ($9)./$10 ($11)./$12 ($13)./$14 ($15)./$16 ($17)./$18 ($19)./$20 ($21)./$22 ($23)./$24 ($25)./$26 ($27)./$28 ($29)./$30 ($31).]
13051: How many? ([Points/Standing/Notes]: $1) [None, actually./One (Cost: $2)./Three (Cost: $3),/Six (Cost: $4)./Nine (Cost: $5)./Twelve (Cost: $6).]
13052: This $0 will cost you $1 [Conquest Points/credits of Imperial Standing/Allied Notes].
13053: It seems you're short on [Conquest Points/Imperial Standing credits/Allied Notes], soldier. Come back when you've got a bit more seasoning under your belt.
13054: Proceed? (Required [Points/Standing/Notes]: $1) [Yes./No.]
13055: <Player> obtains $1 in exchange for $0 [Conquest Points/credits of Imperial Standing/Allied Notes].
13056: <Player> obtains $2 $1 in exchange for $0 [Conquest Points/credits of Imperial Standing/Allied Notes].
13057: <Player> obtains $6 in exchange for $0 [Conquest Points/credits of Imperial Standing/Allied Notes].
13058: This $3 will cost you $1 [Conquest Points/credits of Imperial Standing/Allied Notes].
13059: You already have $6, and I'm not authorized to furnish you with another. Resources are in short supply. You'll have to make do with what you've already got.
13060: 
13061: 
13062: 
13063: 
13064: 
13065: 
13066: 
13067: 
13068: How many? ( [Conquest Points/Imperial Standing/Allied Notes]: $1)
13069: You may purchase up to $2 at a time.
13070: Oh ho. Look who's rrready for some action.
13071: Why, you! Don't play coy with me, <Player>. You know verrry well what I'm talking about!
13072: I have something for you, courtesy of that mangy moogle we've all grrrown to love.
13073: And how inexplicably convenient; I swear your comrrrade can sniff out adventure from fifty malms away.
13074: When you plod through the same motions three times, it's not hard to find a pattern to them. I suppose I'll be off to the Ru'Lude Gardens now, <Player>.
13075: My ol' adventurer's intuition has never steered me wrong before, and it told me to come here at this very moment! Let's be off, <Player>! I can already hear an adventurous etude playing for us in Ru'Lude.
13076: There is no need for surprise; this will be our fourth undertaking, after all. So, shall we be on our way shortly, <Player>?
13077: I simply analyzed the data available from our three previous exploits and concluded that <Player> would arrive around this time. Let us make haste for the gardens before the Mooglehood feels slighted by our tardiness.
13078: We've done this more times than I can count, Luto! Of course I know when and where my mentor will show up! Are you ready, <Player>? I'm ready! Ru'Lude ho!
13079: "The fourth time's the charm," I always say. I must admit, though, I am a bit surprised as well. At any rate, will you be ready to depart soon, <Player>?
13080: I may very well know <Player> better than [he/she] knows [himself/herself] after our various outings together, so ascertaining [his/her] location was no trouble at all. Anyway, I am ready whenever you are, <Player>.
13081: I had an inkling that today would be the day, and lo and behold, it is! I'm so lucky! Or maybe it's because <Player> and I have already journeyed together so often?
13082: Such acumen may very well be thanks to the bonds we have forged together in battle, Luto. <Player>, I am at your service. Might I suggest we first make our way to the Ru'Lude Gardens?
13083: Maybe doing all these trials in tandewhatsit has bestowed us with some magical connective powers? I don't know why, but I just had a feeling that <Player> would be here today. Gee, I'm so glad I listened to that hunch!
13084: This ability--if it can even be called that--is merely the byproduct of our shared experiences. <Player>, I shall expend my utmost effort in this new trial. I trust you will do the same as well.
13085: This will be our fourth trial in tandem. I did not get this far by ignoring <Player>'s behavior. Whew, am I ever itching to whip me some upstart beastmen hides. Plus, It would be bad form to keep that moogle waiting. Let's be off soon, <Player>.
13086: Well now, it seems [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji] has taken to these trrrials like a Goblin gambler to beastcoins. Here's your missive, by the way.
13087: Well now, it seems [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde] has taken to these trrrials like a Goblin gambler to beastcoins. Here's your missive, by the way.
13088: Well now, it seems [Chanandit/Deulmaeux/Demresinaux/Ephealgaux/Gauldeval/Grauffemart/Migaifongut/Romidiant] has taken to these trrrials like a Goblin gambler to beastcoins. Here's your missive, by the way.
13089: Well now, it seems [Armittie/Cadepure/Clearite/Epilleve/Liabelle/Nauthima/Radille/Vimechue] has taken to these trrrials like a Goblin gambler to beastcoins. Here's your missive, by the way.
13090: Well now, it seems [Balu-Falu/Burg-Ladarg/Ehgo-Ryuhgo/Kolui-Pelui/Nokum-Akkum/Savul-Kivul/Vinja-Kanja/Yarga-Umiga] has taken to these trrrials like a Goblin gambler to beastcoins. Here's your missive, by the way.
13091: Well now, it seems [Cupapa/Jajuju/Kalokoko/Mahoyaya/Pakurara/Ripokeke/Yawawa/Yufafa] has taken to these trrrials like a Goblin gambler to beastcoins. Here's your missive, by the way.
13092: Well now, it seems [Fhig Lahry/Khuma Tagyawhan/Pimy Kettihl/Raka Maimhov/Sahyu Banjyao/Sufhi Uchnouma/Tsuim Nhomango/Yoli Kohlpaka] has taken to these trrrials like a Goblin gambler to beastcoins. Here's your missive, by the way.
13093: Well now, it seems [Durib/Dzapiwa/Jugowa/Mugido/Voldai/Wagwei/Zayag/Zoldof] has taken to these trrrials like a Goblin gambler to beastcoins. Here's your missive, by the way.
13094: And don't bother asking about my failing business. It'll just rrrub me the wrong way. Keep your mind on the trial at hand, not my stupid plight.
13095: To tell the trrruth, I wanted to put your new skills to good use. Sadly, this dumb world isn't so forrrgiving. All we need is for one lousy job to come our way!
13096: It figures... It's always the ill winds and never the gentle breezes that blow our way.
13097: This simply isn't fair! I cannot abide the fact that my failures are utterly ruining you, Luto!
13098: You do not deserve this, Luto. My lack of composure has brought this upon us both...
13099: I cannot adequately express the depth of my remorse. Had I not failed time and time again, then maybe...
13100: I'm very very very sorry I failed you, Luto! I'll make it up to you! I promise!
13101: My sincerest apologies, Luto. I never once considered the bind in which my failures would entrap you...
13102: How unbecoming of me. I am supposed to help contribute to your business, yet I cannot even do that...
13103: I feel so immensely terrible, Luto! Never in my wildest dreams did I mean to inflict such misery upon you!
13104: I cannot help but feel responsible for this. You can place all the blame on me and my shortcomings as an adventurer.
13105: I feel sorrier than a salted sea slug, Luto! What can I do to make things better!? I'll do everything within my power to help you!
13106: I alone should bear this burden--not you, Luto. You have been so kind to me, despite my myriad missteps.
13107: I'm sorry, Luto. I should not have failed you so.
13108: Cut the histrrrionics! Are you an adventurer or some mewling kitten!?
13109: Keep your chin up and concentrate on your trrrial. I don't want to get your fur all in knots before you even start, so let's just forget I said anything, okay?
13110: Jeuno's a big place, teeming with people facing all sorts of prrroblems. It should take only two swishes of a tail before one of them brings us some work!
13111: And when they do, I'll make sure to tuck it away until you're done training. Then you can clear it in a heartbeat and show the world just how much your skills have imprrroved!
13112: After that, word of your magnificent feat will spread throughout the town and offers will come pouring in! And I'll be able to feast to my hearrrt's content! Yes...yes...I can taste the bison steak already.
13113: I'll be rrright here--you two and the steak in my thoughts--waiting to hear some juicy stories upon your rrreturn. I know you'll make easy prey of those fiends, and that's why I'm counting on you!
13114: Such words hardly come naturally to me, but...thank you, Luto.
13115: Our days of glory shall come, Luto, and I shall be the one to usher them in!
13116: You have my thanks, Luto. I'll return that kind gesture the first chance I get.
13117: Your largess knows no limits, Luto. I am in your debt.
13118: Luto, you...you're like the elder sister I never had! Thank you so much!
13119: I don't often lose my composure, but when I do, it's usually to heartfelt encouragement like this, Luto.
13120: You're too kind, Luto.
13121: That's the Luto I know and love! You always find the right words to lift my spirits!
13122: I'm truly grateful for the kind words you've bestowed upon me, Luto.
13123: Luto... <sniff> I promise I won't let you down!
13124: I feel that your compassion may be wasted on someone such as myself, but I am truly grateful nevertheless.
13125: I feel ready for anything after that impassioned speech, Luto. I'll make sure to rouse your spirits the next time they need it!
13126: Whew, that's one obstacle down. You're on your own from here on out, but you know the prrroverb: when Altana gives you Azouph greens, charm a chocobo.t Anyway, I wish you the best of luck!
13127: Oh ho. I see you're still both in one piece. Congratulations then on your trrriumph. How do you feel? Have you noticed any changes since your departure?
13128: As tedious as these trials are, I think I'm ready for another. Why, this is the strongest I've felt since I kicked that little... No, I'd best not say any more.
13129: Now I'm light as a cloud and tough as a tree! My hands can hit what even my eyes don't see!
13130: I'm not half bad. I wager I could go one-on-one with the Shadow Lord and barely even break a sweat.
13131: I feel quite empowered, thank you. All my senses seem heightened to the point where, for a fleeting moment, I almost questioned my mortality.
13132: What can I say? I'm ready to sink my teeth deep into the next job and tear off a chunk of absolute victory!
13133: I feel good enough to ask you out to dinner with me next week. Stay that thought! I'm not sure you're ready for me yet, my dear.
13134: This is a wonderful feeling. I am quite sure that were I to gaze into a mirror, all my senses as well as my face would be given point.
13135: I've never felt anything like this! I could take on all the evil in Vana'diel and emerge unscathed, to say nothing of your next task for me!
13136: This is a splendid feeling indeed. A simple wave of my hand seems sufficient to accomplish even the most arduous of tasks.
13137: This feeling is the best! It's like I huffed and puffed and blew down a wall that was blocking me! Now, what would you call that? A boundary bust, maybe?
13138: What a spectacular sensation. I can feel an unbelievable power welling up from the very depths of my being, surging through my limbs...
13139: I feel like I could claim all the world with a swift stroke of martial justice that's been sharpened upon my newly heightened senses.
13140: It's good to see you're enjoying your powerrrs.
13141: And while I'd like to rrreward your vim with an equally vigorous assignment, I don't have any right now. As I'm out of other ideas, why not continue training with <Player>?
13142: I suppose if there's nothing better to do...
13143: You won't be sorry, Luto. I promise to be so valiant that you'll hear minstrels singing my praises before I even return!
13144: If that's how it is, that's how it is. I have no qualms with more training.
13145: As long as you suggest such a course of action, Luto, I shall heed your sage advice.
13146: You're abso-truly-complelutely fine with me training some more!? You're the greatest, Luto!
13147: How do you always know exactly what to say to me, Luto? A purrrfect response, if I do say so myself.
13148: That would be simply divine! What a wonderful idea, Luto.
13149: Really!? Can I!? Then I'm going slay so many monsters that I'll forget why I'm slaying them in the first place!
13150: You are more than kind, Luto, and I shall avail myself of your generous offer.
13151: They say faith makes you stronger, and I have crates of faith in both you and <Player>! A little more training and I should be almost invincible!
13152: I shan't question your acumen, Luto. If that is what you suggest, I shall devote myself to training as thoroughly as possible.
13153: Is that your consent I hear? Then <Player> and I shall form an army of two, leaving nothing but a wake of utter destruction in our path.
13154: Don't pull any punches, either. I think it'd be the cat's meow if you come back even strrronger.
13155: The same goes for you, <Player>. You wouldn't want the disciple to become the masterrr, would you?t
13156: The faster we depart, the faster we can finish this errand. Therefore, I'll be taking my leave now.
13157: I'll forge the way for us, <Player>! Just make sure you don't fall too far behind!
13158: I'll take the lead on this one and let you bring up the rear, <Player>. Rendezvous with me when you're able.
13159: I beg your leave. I apologize for my early departure, <Player>, but I shan't be too far ahead.
13160: I'm going to run on ahead, <Player>. Catch up with me if you can!
13161: Well, <Player>, I'm going on ahead. Just call my name if you find yourself in trouble. ...And here's looking at you, Luto. You're welcome to join us anytime.
13162: Well, I'm off. Remember, <Player>, no dilly-dallying. Finish what you have to do, then hurry right along.
13163: I can barely contain myself. I mean I can't contain myself at all! You better not linger long, <Player>, or there won't be any monsters left for you to practice on!
13164: And this is where I take my leave. Should you require my presence, <Player>, simply say the word and it shall take me mere moments to appear at your side.
13165: I'm going to leave now so I can start training right away. You're going to be so proud of me, <Player>. I just know it!
13166: Please excuse me, I must be going now. If you would be so kind as to let me know when you leave, <Player>, I would be extremely appreciative.
13167: Good-bye, Luto. And <Player>, if you don't make haste after your conversation's finished, the consequences will be...how should I say...excruciating? Bwahaha!
13168: Hmmm. I should prrrobably get this business back up and running soon.
13169: I realize that capable adventurers like you and your friend won't stay satisfied with trrraining missions forever, now, will you?
13170: Maybe my old scrrratching post will help me come up with some good ideas to get back on track.
13171: Anyway, get out there and rrraise hell, <Player>!
13172: I knew you'd be back, <Player>. You seem to sense exactly when I'm in the mood for your special serrrvices.
13173: Oh, you. Stop prrretending to be such a kitten. We both know how quickly you get down to business.
13174: And that business starts with taking another missive to that hoary hairball in the Ru'Lude Gardens. Sufferrring succotash, what I wouldn't give to bat that orange pom-pom off his head just once...
13175: Anyway, my whiskers are telling me that [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji] is about to show up. And look what the cat dragged in! I always knew I had a cerrrtain animal magnetism about me!
13176: Anyway, my whiskers are telling me that [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde] is about to show up. And look what the cat dragged in! I always knew I had a cerrrtain animal magnetism about me!
13177: Anyway, my whiskers are telling me that [Chanandit/Deulmaeux/Demresinaux/Ephealgaux/Gauldeval/Grauffemart/Migaifongut/Romidiant] is about to show up. And look what the cat dragged in! I always knew I had a cerrrtain animal magnetism about me!
13178: Anyway, my whiskers are telling me that [Armittie/Cadepure/Clearite/Epilleve/Liabelle/Nauthima/Radille/Vimechue] is about to show up. And look what the cat dragged in! I always knew I had a cerrrtain animal magnetism about me!
13179: Anyway, my whiskers are telling me that [Balu-Falu/Burg-Ladarg/Ehgo-Ryuhgo/Kolui-Pelui/Nokum-Akkum/Savul-Kivul/Vinja-Kanja/Yarga-Umiga] is about to show up. And look what the cat dragged in! I always knew I had a cerrrtain animal magnetism about me!
13180: Anyway, my whiskers are telling me that [Cupapa/Jajuju/Kalokoko/Mahoyaya/Pakurara/Ripokeke/Yawawa/Yufafa] is about to show up. And look what the cat dragged in! I always knew I had a cerrrtain animal magnetism about me!
13181: Anyway, my whiskers are telling me that [Fhig Lahry/Khuma Tagyawhan/Pimy Kettihl/Raka Maimhov/Sahyu Banjyao/Sufhi Uchnouma/Tsuim Nhomango/Yoli Kohlpaka] is about to show up. And look what the cat dragged in! I always knew I had a cerrrtain animal magnetism about me!
13182: Anyway, my whiskers are telling me that [Durib/Dzapiwa/Jugowa/Mugido/Voldai/Wagwei/Zayag/Zoldof] is about to show up. And look what the cat dragged in! I always knew I had a cerrrtain animal magnetism about me!
13183: The only kind of magnetism you possess is the type that repels paying jobs. How much shall I wager that this is just another training mission?
13184: Your whiskers really told you that, Luto? Because I came here after my adventurer's sense began tingling! We're so alike that we should start a business together! One where I get to do real jobs and not just train all the time!
13185: I assume this is just the usual training excursion? Would you be kind enough to remind me what sort of business we're running, again?
13186: Your mental acuity is most laudable, Luto. I expected nothing less from my employer. I shall expend my utmost effort in hopes this training will lead to more steady work.
13187: Awww, another trial in tandem? Just how many of these things are there!?
13188: A new training mission, eh? Well, I'm certainly not one to pass up a chance at impressing the ladies...especially after how I wowed the crowd last time.
13189: Thank you for thinking of me and <Player>, Luto. It's just such a shame these trials never lead to actual work...
13190: Yes! Another chance for me to kick some serious monster tuchus! Still, when I think of how we haven't gotten any work in forever...I...I...waaahhh!
13191: It's time once again for a trial in tandem, is it? Of course, I'm completely fine with undertaking this task so crucial to my own development, but--if I may--it does seem a tad suspicious that we never actually receive any job offers.
13192: You mean we're going off on another tangemawhatsit? Then I have to dig down deep and find my inner strength so we can bop those baddies and get some real work!
13193: Your perspicacity is nonpareil, Luto. I wouldn't want to work under anyone else. I'm quite confident that after this training mission, work is one thing we shall not be in want of.
13194: Another one of these cursed trials!? As much as the sight of scattered monster entrails beneath my bootheel excites me, I can't subsist on excitement alone! What about some real work!?
13195: Heh heh heh. You may think this is just another trial in tandem, but you'd be wrrrong. Your ever-resourceful boss has sifted through Jeuno's litterbox of a marketplace and finally come up with a gem of a job! Ha, whoever said, "Curiosity killed the cat" was dumb as a dagon!
13196: Our grrracious client's only request was that we collect $1 $0 .
13197: And being the genius that I am, I realized you can get $0 on your quest to stroke that mangy moogle's massive ego. It's like getting two goldfish with one scoop of the paw!
13198: Oh...I see. Excuse me, but before we go, I have to dry these premature tears of disappointment I started shedding.
13199: Yeeeaaah! It's time to go a-smashin' and a-bashin' and a-crashin' in the name of good, old-fashioned work! Let's grab this opportunity by the horns and shake it 'til they break off! It's Ru'Lude or bust, <Player>!
13200: Well, another job had to come eventually. It might as well be now. Come on, <Player>--to the gardens.
13201: What a welcome development, Luto. I promise not to disappoint you in this entrepreneurial venture. I assume you do not want to disappoint her either, <Player>? Then let us depart for Ru'Lude.
13202: I knew you'd pull through for us, Luto! Yay! We finally did it! A chocobo in the stable is worth two in the bush, so let's ride on over to Ru'Lude before our meal ticket leaves town, <Player>!
13203: This is just the chance I need to prove how dashing and daring I can be. Be forewarned, Luto, lest you fall so hard for me that you can't get back up. <Player>. You, me, Ru'Lude. Now.
13204: Oh my, what impeccable timing! And here I was just thinking how nice it would be if we could see some work drift our way. It must be fate! Come now, <Player>, it's off to Ru'Lude for us.
13205: Then I'm the girl for you! Just you wait and see, we'll appease the moogle and have us all swimming in a sea of gil! C'mon, <Player>, we've not a moment to waste!
13206: What a pleasant surprise. Thank you for your tireless effort in procuring us employment, Luto. May this endeavor prove fruitful for us both, <Player>.
13207: It's been so long since my last assignment, I think I might've forgotten how to fight, tee hee. Maybe you could teach me again after we visit the magician moogle, <Player>? Anyway, toodleoo until Ru'Lude!
13208: I'm elated to hear we finally have an official assignment. <Player>, let's both exert as much effort as possible to maximize our employability. For now, though, let us make haste to the Ru'Lude Gardens and the magian moogle.
13209: Now that's something to get your heart pumping! A trial and a job all in one!? So, I get to thrash the dirty hides of fiendish brutes for money? Lace my boots and call me ready!
13210: I haven't seen [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji] this motivated in a long time. Be surrre to use that to your advantage.
13211: I haven't seen [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde] this motivated in a long time. Be surrre to use that to your advantage.
13212: I haven't seen [Chanandit/Deulmaeux/Demresinaux/Ephealgaux/Gauldeval/Grauffemart/Migaifongut/Romidiant] this motivated in a long time. Make surrre you use that to your advantage.
13213: I haven't seen [Armittie/Cadepure/Clearite/Epilleve/Liabelle/Nauthima/Radille/Vimechue] this motivated in a long time. Be surrre to use that to your advantage.
13214: I haven't seen [Balu-Falu/Burg-Ladarg/Ehgo-Ryuhgo/Kolui-Pelui/Nokum-Akkum/Savul-Kivul/Vinja-Kanja/Yarga-Umiga] this motivated in a long time. Be surrre to use that to your advantage.
13215: I haven't seen [Cupapa/Jajuju/Kalokoko/Mahoyaya/Pakurara/Ripokeke/Yawawa/Yufafa] this motivated in a long time. Be surrre to use that to your advantage.
13216: I haven't seen [Fhig Lahry/Khuma Tagyawhan/Pimy Kettihl/Raka Maimhov/Sahyu Banjyao/Sufhi Uchnouma/Tsuim Nhomango/Yoli Kohlpaka] this motivated in a long time. Be surrre to use that to your advantage.
13217: I haven't seen [Durib/Dzapiwa/Jugowa/Mugido/Voldai/Wagwei/Zayag/Zoldof] this motivated in a long time. Be surrre to use that to your advantage.
13218: Anyway, just in case your attention span's shorrrter than my supply of catnip, bring me $1 $0 when you're done with the trial. Get it? Got it? Good.
13219: Be careful out there...and tearrr 'em all to shreds!
13220: Congratulations on finishing with your nine lives intact. I see you also remembered to bring back $1 $0 . Grrreat job! So, how'd it feel working for the Man--er, Mithra?
13221: It was refreshing to feel something other than frustration at this eternal struggle for self-betterment. I guess it was nice to have been of service, too.
13222: Just the sight of <Player> and me was so imposing that they cowered and ran away without a fight! Next time, could you give us something a little more meaty and flavorful?
13223: Pffft. I could've gotten a wagonful of those things without a problem. I don't know if I could even call what we just did "work."
13224: It was a valuable learning experience. It will also be liberating to finally not have to rely on my parents for pecuniary aid.
13225: Why'd you give us such an easy job with barely any clashing, bashing, or mashing? Don't think you can coddle me just 'cause I called you my big sister once!
13226: That was a nice bit of exercise. My muscles are rippling even more than when we set out. Fighting beside <Player> was all fine and well, but how about you and I meet for a midnight spar sometime, Luto?
13227: Thank you for asking, Luto! Well, knowing I contributed to society this time has given me an even more powerful sense of accomplishment! Without a doubt, I'll be sleeping soundly tonight.
13228: I'm so worked up I can't even describe how I feel! I was all like, "Boom," "Hya," "Shaaa," the whole time! I haven't felt like this in sooo long!
13229: It was both a pleasure and an honor to successfully execute such a significant assignment with <Player>. That alone is enough of a reward, and yet I was blessed with this new feeling of empowerment as well. I simply could not be any happier.
13230: It's like I doubled my treasure, doubled my fun, and doubled my power with...ummm, how's that go again?
13231: It was an invaluable experience and a wonderful opportunity to improve not only my own, but someone else's life as well. I thank you for giving me such a chance, Luto.
13232: Oh, the rush! You wouldn't believe it! I've never felt so alive as when I was killing monsters...for the sake of others! I'm eternally indebted to you, Luto.
13233: Glad to see you grrrabbed this job by the throat and shook the life out of it. Hopefully that enthusiasm will lead to more work sometime soon. All we can do now though is wait and see.
13234: ...I can't tell if she's the most violent and deranged Mithra I've met or she's just overly excitable. At any rate, I'm getting out of here. Stay alive, <Player>.
13235: As much as I would like to rest on my laurels, <Player>, I can't ignore the call of natu--er, adventure. To the herocave!
13236: Indeed. I guess I should get back to my daily routine of doing amazing things in exotic locales with famous people. Until next time, <Player>.
13237: I eagerly await our next assignment. I shall now return to my parents' humble abode and bide my time until I am needed once more. Until we meet again, <Player>.
13238: That's my mentor! I bet you already have something lined up--wait a minute! You're holding out on me just to be a big meanie bully, aren't you!? Make sure she doesn't run away, <Player>! I'm gonna go tell on her!
13239: That's right, Luto. You know exactly how to make this tomcat purr. And if you're ready to accept that offer, you know where to find me. Alright, <Player>, if you ever need help gettin' in with the [ladies/gentlemen], just give me a holler.
13240: May that time come sooner rather than later. I wouldn't want to leave my dear <Player> all by [his/her] lonesome for too long. Anyway, I would love to stay and chat, but I can hear my household chores calling me. Ta-ta, you two!
13241: Yeah, that'd be fabuwonderous if we got another gig! We'd be all, "Look at us with our money and our skills! We're the besterrific!" Oh, whoa! ItotallyforgotI'vegottogonow! Bye, <Player>!
13242: I would be extremely appreciative were you to inform me the moment we receive a new job offer, Luto. I enjoyed this excursion so much, I simply cannot wait to go on another! And <Player>, if you need anything--anything at all--please do not hesitate to contact me.
13243: Luto, don't say that in front of me! It's disgusting! Uh, I mean the throat-shaking thing, not the getting-another-job thing! I'd love another chance to help a fellow citizen in need! Anywho, bye-byebees, <Player>!
13244: I shall stay ever vigilant until that time--eyes peeled, searching for denizens in need. Should you wish to accompany me, <Player>, dally not long, for evil never rests!
13245: I like your style, Luto! That's the same way I would've put it, except maybe with a bit more blood and leather. Hahaha! <Player>, if you ever have some down time and need to get whipped back into shape, you know where to find me.
13246: Now that those runts have run back to their litter, I just need to rrrelay these $0 to our client and collect my pay.
13247: ...What!? Um, ahem, I mean our pay, of course! Serrriously, <Player>, if you've got enough time to eavesdrop on honest, harrrdworking folk, why don't you make yourself useful and go on another adventure with [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji]!?
13248: ...What!? Um, ahem, I mean our pay, of course! Serrriously, <Player>, if you've got enough time to eavesdrop on honest, harrrdworking folk, why don't you make yourself useful and go on another adventure with [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde]!?
13249: ...What!? Um, ahem, I mean our pay, of course! Serrriously, <Player>, if you've got enough time to eavesdrop on honest, harrrdworking folk, why don't you make yourself useful and go on another adventure with [Chanandit/Deulmaeux/Demresinaux/Ephealgaux/Gauldeval/Grauffemart/Migaifongut/Romidiant]!?
13250: ...What!? Um, ahem, I mean our pay, of course! Serrriously, <Player>, if you've got enough time to eavesdrop on honest, harrrdworking folk, why don't you make yourself useful and go on another adventure with [Armittie/Cadepure/Clearite/Epilleve/Liabelle/Nauthima/Radille/Vimechue]!?
13251: ...What!? Um, ahem, I mean our pay, of course! Serrriously, <Player>, if you've got enough time to eavesdrop on honest, harrrdworking folk, why don't you make yourself useful and go on another adventure with [Balu-Falu/Burg-Ladarg/Ehgo-Ryuhgo/Kolui-Pelui/Nokum-Akkum/Savul-Kivul/Vinja-Kanja/Yarga-Umiga]!?
13252: ...What!? Um, ahem, I mean our pay, of course! Serrriously, <Player>, if you've got enough time to eavesdrop on honest, harrrdworking folk, why don't you make yourself useful and go on another adventure with [Cupapa/Jajuju/Kalokoko/Mahoyaya/Pakurara/Ripokeke/Yawawa/Yufafa]!?
13253: ...What!? Um, ahem, I mean our pay, of course! Serrriously, <Player>, if you've got enough time to eavesdrop on honest, harrrdworking folk, why don't you make yourself useful and go on another adventure with [Fhig Lahry/Khuma Tagyawhan/Pimy Kettihl/Raka Maimhov/Sahyu Banjyao/Sufhi Uchnouma/Tsuim Nhomango/Yoli Kohlpaka]!?
13254: ...What!? Um, ahem, I mean our pay, of course! Serrriously, <Player>, if you've got enough time to eavesdrop on honest, harrrdworking folk, why don't you make yourself useful and go on another adventure with [Durib/Dzapiwa/Jugowa/Mugido/Voldai/Wagwei/Zayag/Zoldof]!?
13255: You two may think you're the cat's shalwars, but you're hardly strrrong enough to bite the hand that feeds you. Maybe you will be eventually if you keep training, but until then, you shouldn't get too full of yourselves.
13256: Welcome to the MHMU's porter service, kupo! Which of your burdensome belongings shall I take off your hands today?
13257: Do something, kupo? [Porter service?/Buy a storage slip./No, thank you.]
13258: Is your gobbiebag splitting at the seams? Mog Safe spilling over? Why, an accomplished adventurer like yourself surely has more stuff than you know what to do with.
13259: That's where I come in, kupo. I'll gladly hold onto your prized possessions, freeing you space to gather up even grander goodies.
13260: To make use of my services, first you'll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of $19 gil.
13261: Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.
13262: You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.
13263: Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.
13264: Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip. I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.
13265: Invisible to you, at least. It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.
13266: When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.
13267: I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw. Simple as that, kupo!
13268: What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred! Pretty generous of us for a change, no?
13269: Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo. So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!
13270: For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.
13271: Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect! It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.
13272: Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.
13273: If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts! No "I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again!" Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.
13274: Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.
13275: If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.
13276: And that's all there is to it. This humble moogle can hardly wait to serve you!
13277: Buy something? (p. $16/$17). [Previous page./$0./$1./$2./$3./$4./$5./$6./$7./$8./$9./$10./$11./$12./$13./$14./$15./Next page./Cancel.]
13278: $32 will cost you $19 gil. Do we have a deal, kupo?
13279: Deal, kupo? (Current gil: $18). [Check storable items./Deal./No deal.]
13280: The $32 will allow you to store the following items:
13281: $33.
13282: $33.
13283: ...and that's all.
13284: $32 (p. $16/$17). [Previous page./$0./$1./$2./$3./$4./$5./$6./$7./$8./$9./$10./$11./$12./$13./$14./$15./Next page./Cancel.]
13285: Warning! If you lose your $0 while storing a corresponding item, you will be forever unable to retrieve that item!
13286: Is that $3 I see, kupo?
13287: What will you do? [Retrieve an item./Confirm storable items./Nothing.]
13288: Retrieve an item? (p. $16/$17). [Previous page./$0./$1./$2./$3./$4./$5./$6./$7./$8./$9./$10./$11./$12./$13./$14./$15./Next page./Cancel.]
13289: Retrieve $32? [Retrieve it./Leave it.]
13290: You retrieve $0 from the porter moogle's care.
13291: Kupo? I'm already taking care of that item for you.
13292: $0, yes? Very well! Your precious property is safe with me, kupo!
13293: $0 [variety/varieties] of item, is it? Very well! Your precious property is safe with me, kupo!
13294: Is that a Magian insignia I see on that $0? You'll have to abandon your trial before I can take it off your hands, kupo.
13295: That $0 appears to be augmented. I'm sorry, but I can't accept such specialized gear, kupo.
13296: Curious as to whether I can accept that item? Let me check my annals.
13297: Why, yes I can! % can be stored with $1.
13298: Why, it looks as if you have $1 located in your [inventory/Mog Safe/Mog Safe 2/Mog House storage/Mog Locker/Mog Satchel/Mog Sack/Mog Case/Mog Wardrobe/Mog Wardrobe 2/Mog Wardrobe 3/Mog Wardrobe 4/Mog Wardrobe 5/Mog Wardrobe 6/Mog Wardrobe 7/Mog Wardrobe 8/Recycle Bin]!

13308: Hmmm. Sorry, but I don't think you have what it takes to survive these underground caverns.
13309: Have you heard of the Meebles before?
13310: They're a subterranean race of beastmen that strikingly resemble moles. No need to get your britches in a bunch if you haven't, though--studying them is our job.
13311: We, the Meeble Burrows Exploration Committee, have left no stone--figurative or real--unturned in our search for answers about this elusive species. Our results suggest that Meebles are rather docile creatures, with little if any culture to speak of. They shouldn't pose much of a threat.
13312: They're easily manipulated, though, and the Moblins have taken advantage of that. They put the Meebles to work throughout a network of burrows.
13313: Meeble Burrows may be a quaint name, but what sort of fiends lurk amongst these dank caverns? Why are the Moblins making Meebles do their dirty work? And how large are these underground tunnels anyway? Maybe we haven't learned as much about the Meebles and their habitat as we thought...
13314: Wait...if you don't mind crawling through caves and dirtying your own hands for a good cause, how about joining in the exploration? We could use another pair of eyes down there. Just talk to me when you decide you'd like to help the scientific community.
13315: Oho, I knew it was a good idea to prepare this grimoire. Here, it should help with your research.
13316: It looks like you can't carry any more. Try emptying some articles out and return when you have the room.
13317: Hahaha, you look like you've just been thrown from a chocobo! No need to be scared. I'll explain the process as best I can, but feel free to ask if I've missed something.
13318: Let's see if I can do this. First, form a party of one to six people. Next, trade your grimoire to the Burrow Researcher in charge of the burrows you're investigating.
13319: If the need arises, I can always transport you there.
13320: Alright, here goes nothing. First, form a party of one to six people. Next, trade your grimoire to me.
13321: [You'll receive/I'll give you/I'll give you] $6 and $6 once you hand it over. After that's done, you're ready to go spelunking...unless you're the party leader.
13322: Then you'll have to talk to [the Burrow Researcher/me/me] again to decide which expedition to undertake.
13323: I must warn you, though, that some expeditions require everyone to make a unanimous decision.
13324: Once your party's expedition has been chosen, it's time to go spelunking.
13325: Have your party leader talk to the Meeble guarding the burrow entrance. He'll escort you to the right research site.
13326: After you've finished an expedition, use $1 to return aboveground and report to [the Burrow Researcher in charge or me/me/me] to get your grimoire back.
13327: Now for a word about grimoires. They impart various benefits depending on what expeditions you've completed.
13328: It's dangerous down there, so be sure to make use of your grimoire.
13329: Finally, while there are many types of grimoires, they all share the same attributes. Feel free to change them out depending on your companions and the research assignment at hand.
13330: You must be the explorer my compatriot in Jeuno was talking about. What brings you here?
13331: Well, well, look who it is. What do you need this time?
13332: Finally! I've been waiting for you this whole time.
13333: We thought we had a bead on the Meebles' habitat, but it turns out we were dead wrong. There's another set of caverns in the vicinity of Batallia Downs!
13334: I can't understand how it remained buried for so long. Reports abound that the Moblins have expanded their base of operations and are employing Meebles for "nefarious deeds" once again.
13335: Now it's up to us, the Meeble Burrows Exploration Committee, to unearth heaping amounts of knowledge for our glorious archives! Oh, and maybe to save the day, too.
13336: How, you ask? By collecting as much information as possible through new expeditions and finally getting to the bottom of this Moblin nuisance! We're always in need of proven researchers like yourself, should you wish to join in the action.
13337: What do you want to do? [Head to the burrows./Choose an expedition./Get my grimoire back./Examine grimoire records./Check $3 stock./Redeem research marks./Inscribe feats upon your grimoire./Purchase emblems of valiance./Purchase a grimoire./Ask for further information./Review expedition specifics./Nothing for the nonce.]
13338: What do you want to do? [Head to the burrows./Change expedition. (Currently: [Adj./Ast./Inst./Assoc./Res./R.E.][ #1/ #2/ #3/ #4/ #5/])/Get my grimoire back./Examine grimoire records./Check $3 stock./Redeem research marks./Inscribe feats upon your grimoire./Purchase emblems of valiance./Purchase a grimoire./Ask for further information./Review expedition specifics./Nothing for the nonce.]
13339: Any questions? [No, not right now./How does this whole research thing work?/I...descend into underground caves!?/What are these grimoires about?/How do I begin an expedition?/What goes on after an expedition?/What dastardly foes lurk down below?/Any rhyme or reason to these burrows?/What are research marks?/Can you tell me about the Meebles?/What is grimoire engraving?/Could you tell me about wizened worms?/Palimpsests? Huh?]
13340: You adventurers can help us collect data by embarking on certain expeditions belowground. The goals and activities for each journey you undertake will vary, so this won't be just some routine experiment.
13341: Although these subterranean caverns may appear simplistic from the outside, their twisting corridors disorient even the Moblins. Be careful.
13342: Of course, you'll have to prove your problem-solving skills during more forgiving operations before we let you tackle the truly scary stuff.
13343: Each expedition has a total of three goals for you to achieve. Complete just one goal or up to all three--the choice is yours. However, it should go without saying that the more goals you achieve, the better the reward.
13344: Lastly, the caves are no place for a solo adventurer to be traipsing about. We'll need you to travel in groups of three or more.
13345: Grimoires are types of magical books that ancient sorcerers brandished in battle long, long ago. Now that they've been unearthed again, we can use them for our benefit.
13346: What's the point of adapting them for use in the burrows? Why, to record the feats of explorers like you. Without them, it would be much harder to complete expeditions.
13347: Like I said, they're no picture books for children. They grant powerful effects for each expedition you finish.
13348: These boons pack a punch from the get-go, but completing expeditions also allows you to increase their potency twice! See, I'm sure these grimoires will prove useful in your studies of the Meebles' tunnels.
13349: Just to warn you beforehand, though, boons that affect Auto-Reraise and spoils cannot have their potency increased.
13350: Another catch is that only the effects of your leader's tome may be bestowed upon your party for normal expeditions. Hopefully that should be all the firepower you need, though.
13351: At the moment we only have $0 types of grimoires available, but we do plan on adding to that number eventually.
13352: When you want to start a new expedition, just hand over your grimoire to the Burrow Researcher in charge of the burrows you're investigating.
13353: When you want to start a new expedition, just hand over your grimoire to me.
13354: Once you do that, [he'll/I'll/I'll] dole out $6 and $6.
13355: Those're the only supplies you'll need to start spelunking, but not so fast. You first have to decide what expedition you'll undertake.
13356: I'll help you make the necessary preparations for that based on your grimoire's records.
13357: It may seem like a lot to handle, but there's no need to start shaking in your boots. The Burrow Researcher in charge of the burrows you're investigating will help you make all the necessary preparations for that based on your grimoire's records.
13358: Only then can your party leader declare which journey you and your companions shall embark upon.
13359: It may smack of red tape, but you can only embark upon expedition #1 of each rank at first. At least you're allowed to choose any expedition you've already proven your worth on.
13360: Oh, and before I forget--for particularly grueling endeavors, everyone must sign up individually. The higher-ups like to think of it as "exonerating the committee from responsibility" or something I don't understand.
13361: After signing up, you'll <cough> almost <cough> be ready to set off. The thing is...Meebles[/, like that one over there,/, like that one over there,] roam the mouth of the burrows.
13362: They don't trust anyone but the Moblins, so you'll have to dance like Moblins, prance like Moblins, and even romance like Moblins to gain access to the caves.
13363: ...Actually, you'll only need to stink like Moblins. I can give you $6 in exchange for a grimoire to make sure you smell the part.
13364: Don't worry, this method is tried and true. Meebles have very bad eyesight, so they mostly use their sense of smell to determine who's who.
13365: That sense of smell, however, is unrivaled. Even if you're the only one who isn't carrying $6, they'll sniff you out in an instant.
13366: In fact, the only reason I haven't been turned into Galka gristle after standing here so long is because I keep one on me at all times.
13367: Once the $3 does its thing and the Meebles take you down into their burrows, you're free to experiment all you want.
13368: ...Oh, but if you ever let enthusiasm get the best of you and forget your objectives, just use $6 to remind yourself.
13369: There should be Speleological Handbooks secretly placed by our members all over the burrows.
13370: Holding your $3 up to one should do the trick.
13371: They can also serve as a way to record your underground activities.
13372: Once you finish an expedition, any information you record will have to be reflected in your grimoire.
13373: You'll be given $1 after completing an expedition.
13374: One puff on your $1 will allow your whole posse to climb back aboveground.
13375: After making your escape, there's only one thing left to do. Pay a visit to either the appropriate Burrow Researcher or me and show him your $3.
13376: After making your escape, you can show your $3 to me.
13377: [One of us will/I'll/I'll] reference the data you've collected and catalog it in your grimoire.
13378: If you ever need to escape before completing an expedition, though, you can always use $3 instead.
13379: Sadly, using $3 allows only its bearer to come up for air. Don't forget to show your $3 once you exit, even if you've bowed out midway through.
13380: There's nothing wrong with leaving in the middle of an expedition. You'll never be penalized for it, as we wouldn't want to weaken your adventuring spirit.
13381: Oh, and if you've been wondering how to get ahold of one of these $3, you'll get one from the Meeble guarding the entrance.
13382: Some scary, twisted fiends roam the depths of these caverns...at least that's what our scouts who come back alive tell me. Of course, you'll likely come face-to-face with these nightmares, too.
13383: Why? Well, because you'll be tasked with culling one of them after completing the first four expeditions in a course. That's why.
13384: Whether you choose to accept such a dangerous mission is all up to you. However, keep this in mind.
13385: Accepting such an assignment means you'll never get back any grimoires we're holding for you.
13386: That's right. We'll need to archive all the precious data you've collected. Jeuno wasn't built in a day, and the same goes for our analysis of Meeble Burrows.
13387: Oh, I almost forgot. For extremely harrowing journeys such as these, everyone must sign up individually.
13388: This way we can be absolutely sure that everyone's prepared for the task at hand. We wouldn't want people without enough experience getting hurt down there.
13389: In return for your cooperation (or to make sure you truly survive), I'll bestow on your whole party the boons everyone has received up until now.
13390: This way you'll all be at your best to face the worst...in the name of science!
13391: This may seem obvious, but you can't just mull around all you want down there.
13392: Even if you can use $6 to confuse the Meebles, they aren't stupid enough to ignore you forever.
13393: That's why we've set a $2-minute limit per expedition (Earth time). We want to limit the number of casualties to as few as possible. Safety first, that's our motto.
13394: You should also know that we only give out one $3 every $1 [hour/minute][/s] (Earth time).
13395: We do want you to be the best researcher you can be, though... How about we give you $3 $5 as a first-time offer? That way you can learn the ropes faster.
13396: It took us a while to realize, but the health of our explorers started failing after they'd carry multiple pouches for long periods of time.
13397: On the bright side, I'm bound by the Meeble Burrows Exploration Committee code to keep up to $3 of them for you. Don't ask why the pouches don't affect me. And if you make a joke about my mother being a Moblin...
13398: I may be haler and heartier than the average Galka, but there's only so much of that stench I can take. If you need more pouches than I can carry, you'd better get yourself a pherobarrier box.
13399: Mind if I change to a fairer smelling subject now?
13400: In the event that the spirits haunting these caverns disallow one of your brethren entry, just return aboveground within three minutes without completing any objectives. You'll be refunded your $3 at no cost!
13401: How nice of the committee, right? Now you don't have to burst a blood vessel if something happens during your descent.
13402: We may have many limits and regulations, but we're not heartless. We also dole out "research marks" to those who help us learn about Meeble Burrows.
13403: How do you get them? It's simple. The more you accomplish down there, the more marks you receive. You can also turn in marks for certain items and equipment.
13404: There's no need to be a forlorn funguar, either. The more fellow researchers on your expedition, the more marks you reap. "The more the merrier" has never rung more true!
13405: Our results suggest that Meebles are rather docile creatures, with little if any culture to speak of. They shouldn't pose much of a threat.
13406: They're easily manipulated, though, and the Moblins have taken advantage of that. They put the Meebles to work in caverns all over the realm.
13407: Meeble Burrows may be a quaint name, but what sort of fiends lurk amongst these dank caverns? Why are the Moblins making Meebles do their dirty work? And how large are these underground tunnels anyway? Maybe we haven't learned as much about the Meebles and their habitat as we thought...
13408: Wait...if you don't mind crawling through caves and dirtying your own hands for a good cause, how about joining in the exploration? We could use another pair of eyes down there. Just talk to me when you decide you'd like to help the scientific community.
13409: I'm sure I don't have to lecture you on receiving certain boons from your grimoire depending on the expeditions you've completed.
13410: But you do remember that boons from one grimoire can't be applied to another, right?
13411: Even worse, you build a relationship with your grimoire only to have it stolen away from you by some unfeeling bookworms right before you set off to slay the most fearsome of monsters!
13412: Well, even if you don't remember, those days are long gone! That's the wonderful thing about science--it progresses!
13413: We've identified unique arcane essences that are released with the completion of some goals and imbue the ink of our pens as we record your exploits.
13414: Using these essences, we can reconstruct the boons you've received from your grimoire records. Let me explain.
13415: If you had completed Adjunct Expedition #1, we could inscribe the boons from that expedition onto a blank grimoire.
13416: Of course the boon would be the same as the one granted from completing that expedition...except for the fact that we can only inscribe level one boons into grimoires. Sorry, but the process is not yet perfect.
13417: Want to know what else isn't perfect? These inscriptions aren't free. It's sad, but grimoires and pheromone sacks don't sprout from the ground, you know!
13418: Meebles use their long sniffers to snuff up odds and ends from the burrow floor.
13419: According to our latest scouting report, they dredged up some things called... Give me a minute here...
13420: Palimpsests? I may not have the biggest brain this side of the Sea of Shu'Meyo, but I do know that these papers are some powerful stuff.
13421: The MBEC now also gives away wizened worms to adventurers who complete objectives.
13422: Meebles love their wizened worms, and how. Quite a non sequitur I pulled on you, right?
13423: Except it's not! Give the Meebles that guard the burrow entrances some of those water-starved wrigglers and they'll give you stuff in return...possibly even some parades...sorry, palisades...uh, palimpsests.
13424: Ridiculous name, I know. I can barely say it. These palimpsests are types of magical paper that temporarily aid everyone in your troop.
13425: All you need to do is trade it to the grimoire inside the caverns and you're good to go.
13426: I haven't been able to use it myself yet, so this might not be true. Still, a friend of a friend told me that while each piece of parchment has three possible effects, you can only choose one!
13427: Don't worry, he assures me that you can choose your desired effect through the wonders of that grimoire down there.
13428: If you want the beat-'em-up power of all three effects, though, you'll need to gather three pieces of parchment.
13429: To where will you travel? [The Sauromugue Champaign caverns./The Batallia Downs caverns./Nowhere.]
13430: So, you want to head to the caverns? Alright, I'll make sure you reach Sauromugue Champaign safely...when you're ready, that is.
13431: So, you want to head to the caverns? Alright, I'll make sure you reach Batallia Downs safely...when you're ready, that is.
13432: Well, are you ready? [Ready as ever./Not quite yet.]
13433: In the market for a grimoire, eh? What'll it be?
13434: In the market for a grimoire, eh? Just so you know, we've finally got some new volumes in stock. Maybe that'll change your decision?
13435: Which grimoire do you want? [None at the moment./#./$1./$2./$3./$4.]
13436: I'll accept either $0 research mark[/s] or $1 gil for that. So, how'll you pay?
13437: How will you pay? [I don't want anything anymore./In research marks. (Marks: $2)/In gil. (Current gil: $3)]
13438: Uh, you don't have enough [research marks/gil] to buy this...
13439: Right, I'll dock $1 research mark[/s] from your ledger. Here's your $0.
13440: It looks like this $1 gil's authentic. Alright, here's your $0.
13441: Our coffers are empty. We don't have anything available for [exchange/purchase].
13442: Oh, so you want to abandon your current expedition?
13443: ...But then all the discoveries you've made during it will be discarded. Is that alright with you?
13444: Have your grimoire returned? [Yes./No.]
13445: Fine, but you'll have to give me back your $3.
13446: Turning in your research marks, I see. Very well. What'll it be?
13447: What goods are you looking for? [Dispensables./Sauromugue Champaign rewards./Batallia Downs rewards./Pherobarrier box./None, thanks.]
13448: What goods are you looking for? [Adjunct rewards./Assistant rewards./Instructor rewards./Ast. Researcher rewards./Researcher rewards./Researcher Em. rewards./Total completion rewards./None, thanks.]
13449: Redeem research marks? (Marks: $0) [$1 ($2 marks)./$3 ($4 marks)./$5 ($6 marks)./$7 ($8 marks)./$9 ($10 marks)./$11 ($12 marks)./$13 ($14 marks)./$15 ($16 marks)./$17 ($18 marks)./Previous page./Next page./Not now.]
13450: $0? Well then, you'll need to redeem $1 research mark[/s] for that.
13451: Redeem research marks? (Marks: $2) [Yes./Never mind.]
13452: Redeem research marks? (Marks: $0) [Paper pherobarrier box. ($1 marks)/Wooden pherobarrier box. ($2 marks)/Leather pherobarrier box. ($3 marks)/No.]
13453: A [paper/wooden/leather] pherobarrier box is going to run you $1 marks. Is that okay with you?
13454: You've obtained a [paper/wooden/leather] pherobarrier box! You can now store up to $3 $5!
13455: You don't have enough marks for that... Sorry.
13456: The committee also sells certain key items to adventurers who've completed all expeditions in every rank! So...what'll it be?
13457: What will you purchase? (Gil: $0) [$3 ($6 gil)./$3 ($7 gil)./$3 ($8 gil)./$3 ($9 gil)./$3 ($10 gil)./$3 ($14 gil)./$3 ($15 gil)./$3 ($16 gil)./Nothing.]
13458: You do know the $3 is the emblem of valiance for [Adjunct/Assistant/Instructor/Associate Researcher/Researcher] expeditions based in [Sauromugue Champaign/Batallia Downs], right? Are you sure that's the one you want?
13459: Purchase the $3? [Yes./No.]
13460: Inscribe which feats? (GilF$1) [Adjunct #1 ($2 gil)./Adjunct #2 ($3 gil)./Adjunct #3 ($4 gil)./Adjunct #4 ($5 gil)./Assistant #1 ($2 gil)./Assistant #2 ($3 gil)./Assistant #3 ($4 gil)./Assistant #4 ($5 gil)./Instructor #1 ($2 gil)./Instructor #2 ($3 gil)./Instructor #3 ($4 gil)./Instructor #4 ($5 gil)./Associate Researcher #1 ($2 gil)./Associate Researcher #2 ($3 gil)./Associate Researcher #3 ($4 gil)./Associate Researcher #4 ($5 gil)./Researcher #1 ($2 gil)./Researcher #2 ($3 gil)./Researcher #3 ($4 gil)./Researcher #4 ($5 gil)./Never mind.]
13461: So, you want the feats of [Adjunct/Assistant/Instructor/Associate Researcher/Researcher] Expedition [#1/#2/#3/#4] inscribed in your $0? That'll run you $3 gil, but are you fine with that?
13462: Inscribe said feats? (Gil: $0) [Yes!/Nope.]
13463: Your valiant feats from [Adjunct/Assistant/Instructor/Associate Researcher/Researcher] Expedition [#1/#2/#3/#4] have been successfully inscribed in your $0!
13464: We've got $1 $3 on hand.
13465: We've got $1 $5 on hand.
13466: We don't have a single $3 on hand, but we should in $1 [hour/minute/minute][/s] (Earth time). Sorry, but you'll have to wait until then to get one.
13467: A grimoire, huh? Well then, here's $6 and $6 in exchange.
13468: A grimoire, huh? It seems you have $6 already, so here's just the $3.
13469: What do we have here? This grimoire already seems to contain feats from expeditions under [Sauromugue Champaign/Batallia Downs].
13470: What? You've already given us a grimoire, and one's the limit.
13471: Slow down, you're moving too fast. If you want to change to a different one, you've got to withdraw the one we're already keeping.
13472: I like your gumption, but you've exceeded the authorized time underground. Remember, safety first. Come back in $1 [hour/minute][/s] (Earth time) and we'll let you descend into the depths again.
13473: What will you do? [Go back./Change expedition. (Currently: [Adj./Ast./Inst./Assoc./Res./R.E.][ #1/ #2/ #3/ #4/ #5/])/Check expedition eligibility./Examine grimoire records.]
13474: What rank shall you choose? [Adjunct./Assistant./Instructor./Associate Researcher./Researcher./Researcher Emeritus./None, on second thought.]
13475: Which expedition, then? [[Adjunct/Assistant/Instructor/Associate Researcher/Researcher] #1[./ (Complete).]/[Adjunct/Assistant/Instructor/Associate Researcher/Researcher] #2[./ (Complete).]/[Adjunct/Assistant/Instructor/Associate Researcher/Researcher] #3[./ (Complete).]/[Adjunct/Assistant/Instructor/Associate Researcher/Researcher] #4[./ (Complete).]/[Adjunct/Assistant/Instructor/Associate Researcher/Researcher] #5[./ (Complete).]/None.]
13476: You're absolutely sure you want to attempt [Adjunct/Assistant/Instructor/Associate Researcher/Researcher] Expedition #[1/2/3/4]?
13477: [Adjunct/Assistant/Instructor/Associate Researcher/Researcher/The Researcher Emeritus] Expedition[ #5?/!?] Due to the highly dangerous nature of this assignment, everyone in your troop must speak with me to undertake it.
13478: Agreeing to set off on one of these expeditions means the committee gets to keep any of your grimoires we have on hand. It's for the greater good, I promise.
13479: Don't fret. In return for your cooperation, I'll grant your troop every effect from all grimoires currently registered with me.
13480: How does that sound? [Great! It's a deal./Terrible, that's how.]
13481: Fight the good fight...for the sake of discovery!
13482: What rank of expedition? [Adjunct./Assistant./Instructor./Associate Researcher./Researcher./Researcher Emeritus./None, on second thought.]
13483: Get information on which expedition? [[Adjunct/Assistant/Instructor/Associate Researcher/Researcher] #1.[/ (Complete)]/[Adjunct/Assistant/Instructor/Associate Researcher/Researcher] #2.[/ (Complete)]/[Adjunct/Assistant/Instructor/Associate Researcher/Researcher] #3.[/ (Complete)]/[Adjunct/Assistant/Instructor/Associate Researcher/Researcher] #4.[/ (Complete)]/[Adjunct/Assistant/Instructor/Associate Researcher/Researcher] #5.[/ (Complete)]/None.]

13518: Swarms of vicious fiends have been impeding our scientific discoveries! Therefore, we'd like for you to utterly obliterate as many of them as possible...in the name of knowledge!
13519: This expedition involves collecting data at certain Points deep within the caverns...stealthily. Don't get found by anything there, or you'll come back empty-handed.
13520: Like moths to flame, the beasts in these caves are attracted to Subterranean Safepoint fire. Extinguish the torches to disperse the hordes...but not too fast. Extinguish multiple ones at once and you'll attract unwelcome guests.
13521: "Endeavor to find the most expeditious route from the specified points to increase research productivity." Wow, you'd think whoever made this objective could be a little more direct. Anyway, you may not need this advice, but try not to get found by any enemies along the way.
13522: Swarms of vicious fiends have been impeding our scientific discoveries! Therefore, we'd like for you to utterly obliterate as many of them as possible...without injuring any Snarling Meebles, for they're the subject of our research at the moment.
13523: For the cost of just a few $3 an expedition, you too can help save the lives of starving Meebles. Please, think of the Meebles and do the right thing.
13524: This expedition aims to improve research efficiency by having you find the shortest route from point myeh to point gah. Oh, those names aren't the product of apathy on my part. I'm subtly hinting that the routes change depending on the time of day you enter. Whoops, so much for subtlety.
13525: Those Varanefts and Tectochuks are enigmas wrapped in riddles encased in gobs of mystery. Yummy, yummy mystery. This expedition tasks you with unwrapping and sucking every last drop of mystery out of their behavior.
13526: We'd like you to develop an intimate relationship with certain subjects down there. The catch is that they're not very friendly, so you'll need to endure some of their blows first. Go unconscious, though, and it'll be harder to collect the right data.
13527: Ready for a little reconnaissance? We need someone to clear the way for "big boys" to do "real researcher's work." Pompous jerks. Anyway, this sounds obvious, but try not to get knocked out, okay?
13528: Treasure for everyone! The MBEC has unearthed lots of chests down belowground! Experience has proven that some of those chests are just monsters lying in wait, though...so we've decided to send adventurers down there first.
13529: Swarms of vicious fiends have been impeding our scientific discoveries! Therefore, we'd like for you to utterly obliterate as many of them as possible...which may require you to go for a swim!
13530: "Even filthy bloodsuckers like Hirudinids and Stagdellas can offer scientific insights," my tail! We've tried everything and haven't found a single piece of data worthy of analysis, so...uh...try slaying them at the same time? I don't know.
13531: "Just when we thought it was okay to implement the scientific method again, our fellow researchers get attacked by notarizing monarchs!" Wait a minute! When I find the dolt who wrote this report...
13532: You've researched the rest, so now it's time to take on the best! Brave close encounters with the burrows' most feral fiends to receive glory, gil, and [girls/guys]! ...Wait, we don't have the funds for those last two.
13533: The goal of this expedition is to compile data regarding certain points within the burrows. The area is crawling with annoying Mafic Maroliths, though. We know that they possess a hive mentality, so as long as you take some down, the others should get the point.
13534: Ever feel like you're being watched? I do all the time. My superiors tell me that our activities are being monitored by enemies...though not by the evil rarab in my closet, as I'd suggested. But what do they know!? Try and beat them at their own game and best them without getting detected. Then maybe I can get some sleep at night.
13535: The Meebles we were observing have been attacked! Oh, the Galkanity! The Elvaanity! The...I'm so flustered I can't think! Please save them! Without their cute little snouts and endearing gruff talk, what else is left in the world to enjoy!?
13536: Like moths to flame, the beasts in these caves are attracted to Subterranean Leohtfaet fire. Extinguish the torches to disperse the hordes...but not the Meebles. Spare the Meebles at all costs.
13537: Those adorable Meebles are at it again, collecting $3 like they were real miners. Indulge them in their harmless fantasy and try finding $3 at mining points throughout the caves. Pretty please?
13538: Swarms of vicious fiends have been impeding our scientific discoveries! Therefore, we'd like for you to utterly obliterate as many of them as possible.
13539: The goal of this expedition is to compile data regarding certain points within the burrows. For this one, they've even been pre-numbered for you! All you need to do is examine them in order from youngest to oldest. What, that's not how you say it? You mustn't be from around here.
13540: Those dastardly little buggers are breaking our Burrows Depthmarker! Show them that science always shines brightest by defending the Burrows Depthmarker for as long as possible!
13541: On this expedition, you'll have to make as many hot-tempered bombs as possible self-destruct. Sounds like your best bet is to insult their cooking. Thanks, I'll be here for all eternity.
13542: Moblins are supposedly gathering certain "elaborate parts" from treasure chests and fallen fiends. We don't know exactly what manner of confounding contraption they intend to contrive, but bring us enough parts and we'll <ahem> "piece it together."
13543: $0, huh? That'll grant you the following effects:

13550: Good job. Now it's time to record your latest discoveries in your $3.
13551: It looks like you've completed $0 goal[/s] on this last expedition. Now that everything's been recorded, you can have your grimoire back.
13552: You've completed all three goals!? Great! You're a credit to the Exploration Committee, <Player>, and more than worthy of your grimoire.
13553: Well, you may not have met any goals this time, but failures are the building blocks of success. Good luck next time!
13554: It must have been really hairy down there, huh? Oh, and as I explained before, we'll be needing that grimoire of yours for analysis.
13555: Here's a new grimoire we've prepared for you. Go on, take it.
13556: I'm part of the Meeble Burrows Exploration Committee, but I'm not allowed to say anything else about our operations right now. If you'd like to learn more, try talking with the Burrow Investigator in Upper Jeuno.
13557: Sorry, but your party leader is making preparations for your journey. I can't return your grimoire.
13558: What'll it be? [Peace out./Help an adventurer recover!/Receive $6./Get key items and titles./Receive 10,000 research marks./Receive a completed $0. /
13559: Yee haw, you done recovered!
13560: The grimoire boons that were bestowed upon you are no more. You'll be entering the area as if this were your first time.
13561: Your grimoire boons have been miraculously set at level 1! Praise Altana's guiding light! You may also enter any room you wish.
13562: For what expedition rank? [Quit wasting my time./Adjunct./Assistant./Instructor./Associate Researcher./Researcher./??? /
13563: DEBUG:$0/$1/$2/$3/$4/$5/$6/$7.
13564: Don'tcha think dat furrowed brow and cocked head o' yers escaped me. Yer int'rested in dis chest, ain'tcha? Well, ya gots good right tah be, 'cause even us Gobbies is fascimanated wit' it. It's some sorta myst'ry box salvaged from a shipwreck in da Gugru Blue! Da mysterious part is dat what goes in don't necessarilies come out!
13565: While I may tout its amazin'ness, don'tcha think fer even a second dat I's at liberty tah divulge hows we came by it. Still, I likes yer face. It's a kind face, one dat says ya won't stabs me in da back, which is more'n I can say fer my own mum. Lemme shows ya how to use dis myst'ry box.
13566: Bah-dah-bah-dahm dah-daaahm! Ya open da chest. Dat's it. And da kicker be dat I'm da one doin' da openin'. Ya just gets tah stand dere gawkin' in astonishmament. Easy gig, no?
13567: Oh yeah, 'fore I forget. What good's a chest if ya ain't gots da key? Well, da key to dis chest is da fine art o' waitin'.
13568: Ya wantsa know da hows n' da whys? Well da bosses had our tinkers tinkerin' on troo' da night and dey foun' dat...
13569: Well, dey foun' dat we really gots no idea why da loot changes. Anywho, ya's wanna wait 'n wait 'n wait, den keep on waitin' some more. "Good things come tah dose who wait," right? Well, da longer ya wait, da gooder da thing...maybe. Ya just never know wit' a myst'ry box.
13570: Also, I calls da amount o' time ya's waited yer circa...circama...circamadamian...ugh, yer "daily tally." It ain't just da name dat's catchy, though. Da higher yer tally, da gooder yer goods get! Can't get much good--er, simpler dan dat.
13571: Finally, ya opens da chest. Oooh, I can barely contain m'self thinkin' o' all da riches I--er, ya could have!
13572: Oh, dat's right! Heyheyhey, got any items ya won't be needin'? If so, fork 'em over 'n yer daily tally'll increase! Mebbe not by much, but dat's better'n nothin', am I right?
13573: And dere's no better feelin' dan takin' trash and turnin' it into treasure. It's pramactically a new kind o' alchemy! But don't go gung ho 'n overfills da thing 'til its hinges break. Myst'ry boxes don't grow on goobbues, y'know.
13574: Plus, I'll be here tah stops ya if I sees ya stuffin' whole Gobbiebags worth o' possessions in dere, so don't worry yer oversized noggin' over and over over it. Whats was I sayin' again? Ugh, never mind.
13575: Sadly, howsever, anodda myst'ry 'bout dis chest is dat it won't takes just any ol' bauble. It has da taste o' a picky peiste--it feasts upon nothin' but da rarest and unique-est o' artifacts.
13576: Lastly, since we don't knows where da items go once inside, ya ain't gettin' nothin' back datcha put in. Ya reap whatcha sow, and da weather ain't always condusimasive to a good harvest, am I right? My condolemances in advance for any losses ya mights incur from da myst'ry box's fickle nature.
13577: Dat all make 'nough sense tah ya? Just say da woid when ya wanna use my services. I's more'n happy tah help.
13578: Hey! I rem'mber seein' yer foice 'round here. Take a looksie. I's taken' it upon myself tah jigger 'round wit' dese all-new myst'ry boxes, found straight from an ol' capsized vessel in the Gugru Blue.
13579: I's nevah gonna say how we gots our hands on 'em, so dun even ask! But, still, I gots tah say dat dese're somet'in' special! Now try yer hand 'fore I smack ya!
13580: Just select yer desir'd dial and plug 'way at it. Will ya win somethin' super special? Or will't be da booby proize?
13581: Dese're some "special dials," an' I gots no inklin' what's inside. Ya gots tah open 'em yerself tah find out what treasures lie within!
13582: Oh ho, I's forgettin' tah explain somethin' to ya. See dese "special dials"? Dey're super primo, but I still no know wut's gonna be in dere.
13583: So I's not be takin' no responsibility if somethin' weird 'n wacky comes out. Got it? Ya open it, ya keep it.
13584: 'N openin' 'em requires some kinda secret technique. Maybe it'll succeed, maybe tha box'll break. 'Sif I know. But ya can only try 'em once a day.
13585: Oho, ya feelin' lucky 'nough tah takes a stab at da myst'ry box?
13586: Whatcha gonna do? ($7 tally) [Open the box and profit!/Listen to the explanation./Inquire about my daily tally. /Peek at some possibilities./Nothing right now.]
13587: Ya wanna open dat sucker up? Okay, but which dial ya be wantin'?
13588: Dat's da spirit! So which dial ya be wantin'?
13589: So, what dial ya gonna pick? ($7 tally) [I got cold feet, so none./Dial 1 (Materials): $8 tally./Dial 2 (Food): $8 tally./Dial 3 (Medicine): $8 tally./Dial 4 (Sundries 1): $8 tally./Dial 5 (Sundries 2): $8 tally./Special dial: $9 tally [/ (already opened)]./Adoulin dial: $10 tally[/ (already opened)]./Pictlogica dial: $11 tally[/ (already opened)]./@/@/@/Wanted dial: $12 tally[/ (already opened)]./@/@]
13590: Yer goin' wit' dial $1, huh? Whatchu tryin' ta pull!? Yer daily tally's too low.
13591: Yer goin' wit' dial $1, huh? Lessee what myst'ries await!
13592: Dis box is full o' myst'ries,t Dat span da realm's his'try,t So whatcha gonna get from da chest...o'...uh, fortunery?t
13593: Oooh, looks at what popped out! I hopes it makes yer adventures dat much more adventumarous!
13594: Ya's thought I threw yer prize away?! Prepostamarous! I's just tucked it away for safekeepin' is all.
13595: You have used $1 [point/points] of your daily tally!
13596: Wanna go again?
13597: Keep goin'? [Lemme at it!/Thanks, but no thanks.]
13598: Yer daily tally? It's, um... Y'know, 'round $4 [point/points] or thereamabouts.
13599: Lemme check for ya! Well, it coulda been $0, $1, or mebbe even $2. What? Ya thinks ya could do better wit' one o' dese Gobbie masks on!?
13600: Anywise, where'd da myst'ry be if ya's knew da answer 'fore ya opens it?
13601: Some things is better left unknown. Gotta leave a little room fer romanchismo in da woild, y'know.
13602: Dere we goes. Da myst'ry box seems tah like yer offerin'...but it wants more. Got anythin' else ya wanna throw away?
13603: Dere we goes. Oho, looks like it don't wants no more. Guess ya gotta come back tomorrow if ya's wanna keep gettin' rid o' stuff.
13604: Yer daily tally's increased [a smidge./someamawhats./a Gobby-fold!/a ginormagantic amount!]
13605: Sorrah, but it won't lemme put dis in. Got anythin' it mights like better?
13606: Sorrah, but da chest has dat look. Y'know, da one dat says, "I'll kills ya if ya tries tah give me dat." I guess alls ya can do is comes back some odda time.
13607: Nah, it just won't woik. I's did my best, but yer daily tally just won't go no higher. Ya ain't gonna get no prizes by hoardin' yer points, so stop bein' such a Greedalox and use 'em.
13608: Gil-lovin' Gobbies, %0, ya's hit da jackpot! I's so happy for ya I think I's gettin' da vapors.
13609: %0 obtains $0!
13610: Whoawhoawhoa! If ya's got business wit' da box, ya foist gots business wit' me. Whatcha need?
13611: So ya be wantin' the special dial? Whoawhoawhoa! Get yer grubby hands offa that! Ya don't have enough daily tally, and I's not 'bout tah let ya cheat me!
13612: So ya be wantin' the [special/Adoulin/pictlogica/Wanted/campaign] dial? M'kay, get yerself all steeled up, 'cause here we go! 'Member, no complaints!
13613: So ya be wantin' the [special/Adoulin/pictlogica/Wanted] dial? Whoawhoawhoa! Get yer grubby hands offa that! I's already opened one fer ya today! Haul that keister outta here and come back t'morrow.
13614: Oy, would ya get a look at yer $0! I guess I can let ya open [/Dial 1/Dial 2/Dial 3/Dial 4/Dial 5/the special dial///the abjuration dial/the fortune dial/the furnishings dial//the Vana'versary dial/the festival dial] whenever ya want fer not a single onz o' daily tally!
13615: Dun think that I's be a gil-grubbin' good-fer-nuthin'. If'n ya dun wanna open any dial, then I gives ya back yer $0.
13616: Yer eyes be bigger'n yer stomach. If'n ya wanna open [/Dial 1/Dial 2/Dial 3/Dial 4/Dial 5/the Special Dial///the abjuration dial/the fortune dial/the furnishings dial//the Vana'versary dial/the festival diaal] usin' yer $0, then ya gotta make room in yer bags!
13617: What's be dis? $0? What'm I 'pposed ta do wit it? I dun have any clue how ta use it, so take it home wit ya.
13618: $1<$2
13619: Urk!
13620: Coins oft loosen lips at taverns and markets, but to turn up empty-handed... Where could she have gone?
13621: <Player>! Is that...?
13622: Stand strong!
13623: Back, cur!
13624: You...you came from Iroha's future.
13625: I know not why you seek to spread the Emptiness, but you will have to get through my blade first!
13626: I cannot be destroyed.
13627: Let the darkness fill thy soul...there is no other way...
13628: The reckoning is at hand.
13629: And you, Tenzen...will lead them there.
13630: Lady Iroha!
13631: Iroha! Come back to us!
13632: The ambassador shall not go unpunished!
13633: He took it... He took it from me.
13634: Took what!?
13635: The blessing... Phoenix's blessing.
13636: No... No!!!
13637: This blade I wield also contains the blazing life force of the avatar Phoenix.
13638: This calls to mind my own Phoenix Blade, which once contained a similar power.
13639: Perhaps you recall that my blade also bears the blazing life force of Phoenix.
13640: When I first laid eyes on the girl...
13641: A small fraction of Phoenix's essence was transfused into this cold steel.
13642: Only one blessed by Phoenix could sense it.
13643: If my blade was one of Phoenix's feathers, then Iroha herself is its wings.
13644: I could feel Phoenix flare up upon meeting Iroha.
13645: But I cannot say that Phoenix itself is complete.
13646: Yet my blade sings the praises of that young woman, feeling that in the future she may be Phoenix incarnate.
13647: Though only a portion of its energy was entrusted to it, let there be no doubt: in the future, Phoenix will have fully revived.
13648: The awe is...indescribable.
13649: But this is no time to wax poetic.
13650: Once whole, Phoenix's life force will be without peer, and not even the greatest darkness can overcome it.
13651: Not even the Emptiness that strangles the Far East.
13652: No, even the Emptiness would fully succumb.
13653: But if part of Phoenix's puissance lies with Selh'teus, then how...?
13654: <Player>, seeing what happened to Iroha, and knowing what my blade has told me, there is only one logical conclusion.
13655: We must wrest Phoenix's blessing back from the ambassador of the void!
13656: How do you respond? [Let's do it!/Hang on./What do you suggest?]
13657: Phoenix Blade, please guide us in these bleak times.
13658: Why exactly would we need to wait?
13659: Why're you two sitting there having a little tea party?
13660: My fists are aching for a workout. And you know why?
13661: Because I laid eyes on this creepy masked man!
13662: He kept yammering somethin' about being surprised to cross paths again, and that I haven't changed at all--but I've never seen that worthless piece of trash in my life!
13663: There you are!
13664: Thank goodness I'm not too late.
13665: I stumbled upon a most vexing masked man.
13666: As soon as he laid eyes on me he smirked, saying that I hadn't changed one bit. I could barely stop quivering!
13667: The masked man!? Tell us--where did he go?
13668: I do not know, but he muttered something about an "Astral Candescence."
13669: I'll give him a couple good chops next time he shows his face around here!
13670: He mighta been alone, but that decisive tone of voice--he definitely was talking with someone.
13671: There's something terribly off about him.
13672: He was alone, but...his diction was like he was talking to someone else, not himself.
13673: Have you heard of this little thingy called an "Astral Candescence"?
13674: He was ranting and raving about needing to get his hands on one. What a loon!
13675: He mighta been alone, but that decisive tone of voice--he definitely was talking with someone.
13676: An Astral Candescence... The name is not altogether unfamiliar.
13677: It is a special type of instrument found in the land of Aht Urhgan. For years I had been aching to study one, but I never had cause to visit the Empire.
13678: Aht-what now? What's that? Can you eat it?
13679: Aht...Urhgan? Never have I heard of such a locale.
13680: <Player>, we must make haste!
13681: One of my disciples found out that the Tenshodo in Lower Jeuno can offer us safe passage there.
13682: Head for Aht Urhgan? [Definitely./No way.]
13683: Stupid place sounds like it's too far away for me, too--and you think we've got time to run off chasing after some stupid toy?
13684: I fear I have not the constitution to make such a journey. And besides, isn't there stuff to take care of here in the Middle Lands first?
13685: Lady Prishe, I understand that you may have your hands full, but you, [Lord/Lady] <Player>!
13686: Ugh. Do what you will!
13687: Let us waste not a breath!
13688: I've got a couple...errands to take care of here, but save me a piece of that masked bugger for later!
13689: I'll catch up with the two of you later. There's some unfinished business here I must take care of.
13690: I can't help but wonder if someone...or something...is controlling him.
13691: There's somethin' off about that guy, but I can't place my finger on it...
13692: I can't help but wonder if there isn't more to this masked man than meets the eye...
13693: <Player>, may your journey be a safe one.
13694: Oh, how I yearn-wearn for the ability to work in peace and quiet, free of this horrible facial constraint!
13695: Aha! You over there--I bet you know your way around chocobo riding, don'tcha?
13696: How are your chocobo riding skills? [Absolutely stellar./I've got a ways to go.]
13697: I knew it! Then you're justaru the [man/woman] I've been looking for.
13698: Oh, come now. Humility doesn't suit-wuit you.
13699: % stares you down. Hard.
13700: ...
13701: Give me just a moment.
13702: % blows on a whistle of some sort.
13703: Now all we do is waitaru, and... ...Darn it all!
13704: Urk... Every time they see me they try to bite my nose off like it's a little-wittle sausage!
13705: You see, that's why I've got this mask... Ah! Here we go.
13706: While Vana'dielians have long since mastarued the art of taming the chocobo, a few of us have been working on domesticating some more...exotic beasts.
13707: We think we've finally stumbled upon something, but we're loath to release it upon the populace without taking it for a <ahem> test drive. And that's where adventurers come in!
13708: We figure that if chocobos can run fast, then how about some muscular raptors? We've been toiling day and night, but it's hard to get them to obey anyone other than their handler-wandler.
13709: And this cute little thing here is no differentaru!
13710: That's where you come in--we want her to get used to being around people of all sorts.
13711: So I propose a little deal--if you take her around Batallia Downs, then I'll give you this whistle as a little presentaru.
13712: That's as good a deal as any, I'll say!
13713: What say you?
13714: Ride the raptor? [Sure! This sounds fun!/Maybe later.]
13715: Aw, shucks. I'll be here should you change your mind-wind.
13716: Wheeeeee! Finally, someone says yes!
13717: Okay, you put your hands here... And your feet here...
13718: Picture perfectaru!
13719: Awww, run into a little bit of trouble?
13720: That's okay--why don't you try again?
13721: Then allow me to make the proper preparations-wations!
13722: Now be a doll, would you, and open-wopen up your map of Batallia Downs?
13723: Okay. See these eightaru spots I've marked? They're locations within the downs that I need you to visit. There's a few hollows there, you see...
13724: ...and in those hollows I've left some of our erstwhile companions' favorite treats for you to give to her. If you'll forgive the saying--you'll have her eating out of your hands.
13725: But eight spots is a trifle much, hmm? So let's cut it down-wown to five. That should be enough to make her cuddle up to you like a puppy.
13726: And when you're done with that, I need you to go over here.
13727: My good friend Syrillia will be waiting for you to return that raptor-waptor.
13728: [Like I just said,/You may recall that] sometimes our friend here can be...less than cooperative.
13729: She can get tired--or is it better to say sick of it?--and slow down, and may even shake-wake you off her back.
13730: But she's a sucker for encouragementaru, so if that happens, just /cheer her up.
13731: Another thing: she'll go bolting off home if you dismount, so if that happens just amble-wamble your way back here.
13732: Have a safe trip!
13733: Do you need another explanation of what it is I wantaru you to do?
13734: Do you require an explanation? [Nope. I've got it./If you don't mind.]
13735: Look who made it back--and no worse for the wear.
13736: A deal's a deal!
13737: With this $3, you should be able to call your raptor to your side anywhere out in the field.
13738: Don't give me that dirty look--this one is a bit more docile than the one I had you take around Batallia Downs.
13739: To ride a mount, just select "Mount" from the "Abilities" submenu.
13740: Your $3 is a bit special, because it can produce all manner of lovely sounds.
13741: If you come across $1 in your travels, would you mind showing it to me? I can register it in your $3.
13742: And if you stumble-wumble upon an item known as an "astral notebook," then I can register that, too.
13743: $1 and items beginning with a "t" can be used to obtain new mounts by trading them to %.
13744: Feel free to do so right away.
13745: Note that $1 will not be consumed in the process.
13746: Ah, and while I have you here, the raptor-waptor you took out before could always use more training.
13747: I don't think I could provide you with any more rewards, so it's really up to you. But it would really be quite the boon for me.
13748: Hello, hello!
13749: Help train the raptor? [Let's do this./Can I have an explanation?/Maybe later.]
13750: A wonderful choice indeed! Let's get you all gussied up and ready to go.
13751: Then let me remind-wind you. First, show me your map of Batallia Downs.
13752: Awww... Well, hopefully you'll stop by again.
13753: If you bring me a special item known as an "astral notebook," then I should be able to register it in your $3.
13754: Hm? Are you...
13755: I knew it. You're that adventurer that's friends with Mapitoto, right?
13756: My name is Jeridade.
13757: I look after the chocobos' food, check on their health, and perform various other tasks behind the scenes here.
13758: If you don't mind, there was something I was hoping to ask you.
13759: You're able to summon it, aren't you?
13760: Can you summon it? [What are you talking about?/How did you know?]
13761: Come on now... You've got $6, don't you? You can't fool me.
13762: I knew it! I saw that you had that $3. You wouldn't be involved with her otherwise.
13763: Anyways... What do you want to ride?
13764: Ah, an excellent choice.
13765: I'm interested in mounts that can fly. You know about magic pots and spheroids, right?
13766: Flying mounts are great, aren't they?
13767: For somebody like me who only rides chocobos, they're like something straight out of a dream.
13768: Hey! What are you doing-woing!? Did you finish repairing the chocobo stethoscope?
13769: Oh! The stethoscope is almost finished. I think...
13770: Ah, let me guess. He was talking about flying mounts-wounts again, wasn't he?
13771: I apologize. Whenever Jeridade sees someone carrying-warrying $6, he immediately starts talking about it nonstop.
13772: It's like I've always said... It's my dream. Who wouldn't want to fly freely through the skies!?
13773: I know all aboutaru your dream, but you shouldn't go bothering others with it!
13774: You need to startaru with chocobos first, and then work your way up to bombs and magic pots.
13775: Never.
13776: ...
13777: Fine. How about you aim to be an airship pilotaru then?
13778: Airships are fine and all, but I'd rather fly through the sky like a bird.
13779: I suppose I've got no choice but to make something myself. It'll be a mount that is so stable even I'll be able to ride it!
13780: Okay, I just need to sneak into the Grand Duke Palace and borrow a set of airship blueprints.
13781: Hey, you'll help me, won't you?
13782: W-wait just a momentaru!
13783: I'm just joking. The blueprints won't do me any good without some kind of engine. That's the one thing that I can't make by myself.
13784: Hm... I wonder if there's anything out there that could help me build my own engine...
13785: Maybe it's up above the sky? Or perhaps...
13786: Get back to fixing-wixing that stethoscope already!
13787: I know how he seems, but Jeridade is quite capable-wapable and super smart too, so I imagine if he had the materials, he could probably make a flying mount.
13788: It's all because of Jeridade that we can summon magic pots and warmachines.
13789: I imagine it'll be quite difficultaru, but if you find any information that might help him, can you please let him know?
13790: Oh, remember that I always welcome any astral notebooks-wotebooks that you might find!
13791: Hey, that looks-wooks like an astral notebook!
13792: Or maybe not!$30
13793: Wait a momentaru, could this be...
13794: Whoa! What is this!?
13795: This thing really fires up my engineering spirit!
13796: Hm? Did this thing really fly with humans riding-widing it?
13797: Really!? I've got to repair it right away!
13798: The damage to the chassis can be fixed. The problem is the engine...
13799: Let's see... This goes like this... Which means that this...
13800: Hmm... Wait a moment. This here is...
13801: What is it?
13802: I feel as if I've seen this before...
13803: I know! I saw it in $7!
13804: Wait! Isn't $7 that place in the north with the ruins-wuins? What were you doing there!?
13805: Well, I heard a rumor from an adventurer and decided to go check it out on my day off...
13806: That place sure was dangerous! It was so cold that as soon as my nose started running, it froze to my face! I thought I was done for.
13807: Anyways, back to this machine here! So you see, I haven't actually seen the real thing. I think it was displayed on some sort of device.
13808: Therefore, we'll need to go back to $7 to find a clue about how to get this thing working!
13809: Now that's enough of that! If you get yourself killed-willed, who's going to repair the stethoscope!?
13810: Umm... Wh-when you put it like that... I don't know.
13811: Oh, I got it! Maybe you could go to $7 and search for clues for me?
13812: I'll keep examining this thing here. And deal with the stethoscope too, of course...
13813: Good luck out there!
13814: $7... I hear it's quite an unusual place, to say the leastaru. I feel there's definitely something there.
13815: Let me know if you find anything out there. Be careful that your nose-wose doesn't freeze off either.
13816: By the way, did you happen-wappen to find anything in $7?
13817: Huh!? Is that...!?
13818: I think you're overreacting a bit...
13819: Besides, it looks like we've got ourselves a new clue!
13820: Amazing! This is exactly what we needed!
13821: I took the $3 apart for repairs, and there was something just like it in there. Give me a moment to replace it...
13822: All finished! Let's give it a try, shall we?
13823: Get ready to take off!
13824: Huh!? The chocobos! Waitaru!
13825: I made a slight mistake with the tuning. Here, I'll fix it right away.
13826: There, it should be fine now.
13827: Well? Care to give it a try?
13828: (I'd be scared too if I were you...)
13829: Alright! It worked!
13830: Okay now, I want you to use it.
13831: I thoughtaru you were making this for yourself, Jeridade.
13832: This Levitus... Oh, that seems to be this mount's name. It's carved into the seat.
13833: Anyways, I'll make my own once I develop a new engine. I think I can use the old one for reference.
13834: Now then... I need to go out and get some parts.
13835: Jeridade! What's got you all excited now!?
13836: Hey! Stop! Don't you run away from me!
13837: Ahh... Looks like he got away...
13838: I wonder how this can be register-wegistered in your $3...
13839: Hm? This hasn't been registered in your $3 yet!?
13840: That reminds me... Didn't it just register itself automatically last time?
13841: The $3... I guess there's something about these older vehicles. I better have Jeridade look into the matter-watter in more detail!
13842: Hmm... What is the meaning of this...
13843: For now, it looks like you can summon-wummon it, so I'll ask Jeridade about it. I'll be sure to research it myself too!
13844: x=$0 y=$1 z=$2
13845: Ah, how lovely! Let me register your $0 in your $3.
13846: Amazing-wazing! That's $0!
13847: Wait...I remember reading-weading about the legendary noble chocobos in a treatise by the esteemed Markovich. "Legendary Chocobos of Our Time," I believe that title was.
13848: Chocobos with such cherry-colored coatarus are of royal lineage and are only born during very specific times of the year.
13849: You must be very special-wecial indeed to have procured such a wonderful companion. I hope you enjoy them!
13850: Oh, what I wouldn't give to ride one!
13851: At the very least, please let me pet them!
13852: Either way, let me register your $3.
13853: With this, you should now be able to mount [a chocobo/a raptor/a tiger/a crab/a red crab/a bomb/a sheep/a morbol/a crawler/Fenrir/a beetle/a moogle/a magic pot/a tulfaire/a warmachine/a xzomit/a hippogryph/a spectral chair/a spheroid/Omega/a coeurl/a goobbue/a raaz/Levitus/an adamantoise/a dhalmel/a doll/a golden bomb/a buffalo/a wivre/a red raptor/an iron giant/Byakko/a noble chocobo/an ixion/a phuabo/a craklaw/an alicorn/a bubble crab].
13854: Ahh, welcome. Did you happen-wappen to bring an astral notebook with you?
13855: It appears not. Although, I see you have something else you wish for me to take a looksie-wooksie at.
13856: Now then, let me see what you've got there...
13857: <Player> showed the $3.
13858: Hmm... Yes, I see... Oh no!
13859: It seems-weems that I've done it again...
13860: Anyways, this appears to be rather old music. Indeed, it has piqued my interestaru.
13861: Of course, I'm no archaeologistaru or anything. Please tell me if you learn anything new.
13862: Hey! That's the $3! Allow me to register-wegister it in the $3.
13863: Hmm... It's not working for some reason. Please give me a momentaru to check it out.
13864: What is going on here? Oh no, not again!
13865: It seems I was careless-wareless.
13866: Huh? The music-wusic from before was decoded and registered!?
13867: I see... People from the pastaru must've performed the same research I did...
13868: Just thinking about it fills me with a sense-wense of romanticism.
13869: Okay! I've got to give it my very best effortaru!
13870: Even a small donation of $0 gil would allow me to provide medicine to any patient who may need it.
13871: Thank you so much for your donation. This will save many a life in these trying times.
13872: Thank you so much for your donation. This will save many a life in these trying times.B
13873: Your recent donation is more than sufficient for the time being. Perhaps I will run out and request your services again later.
13874: Would you happen to be in possession of any $0 or $1? I require some to further my research, but they can be quite expensive to procure on my own.
13875: Thank you very much for the $0 and $1. I'm sure the fruits of my research will be reflected in my alter ego's capabilities.
13876: Thank you very much for the $0. I'm sure the fruits of my research will be reflected in my alter ego's capabilities.
13877: Thank you very much for such expensive medicines. I'm sure the fruits of my research will be reflected in my alter ego's capabilities.
13878: I should have more than enough concoctions for my current needs.
13879: I should have more than enough $0 for my current needs.
13880: Let us hope that those at Salahaam's Sentinels keep up their end of the bargain...
13881: Ah. And you must be...
13882: <Player>. Of course. Your reputation precedes you.
13883: I am well aware of the deeds you have performed for me via your connections in Salaheem's Sentinels.
13884: But where are my manners? I have yet to introduce myself.
13885: I am Elijah, but a humble member of the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network (A.M.A.N.).
13886: I have acquired some information about threats that need to be vanquished as part of your excellent work in the Records of Eminence initiative.
13887: I am loath to admit that these foes may be beneath your station, but I would ask you to remove them nonetheless.
13888: Accept the request? [Of course./No thanks.]
13889: You have my gratitude. Allow me to provide you with the relevant intel.
13890: Unfortunate, but not altogether unexpected.
13891: Your quarry resides on the continent of Aradjiah.
13892: Though I would ordinarily rely on local mercenaries for the task, this requires a more...delicate touch.
13893: I promise that the reward will be worthwhile. Double so if you bring proof of the kill.
13894: Should you be able to do so, that is...
13895: While I appreciate your efforts, I am only able to provide you with rewards once per month (Earth time).
13896: I am positive that we will be able to uncover more threats in the upcoming months.
13897: Of course, I will provide you with more information as circumstances warrant.
13898: Once again, your assistance is most appreciated.
13899: Thank you for setting the appropriate objective.
13900: May you strike true.
13901: Elijah smirks at you.
13902: Well, well, if it isn't my favorite intrepid adventurer, <Player>.
13903: You seem to have been quite busy of late, what with all the fiend slaying and equipment collecting going on.
13904: And in between all your marauding, you still found time to deal with Falak. Heroism truly is your most impressive attribute.
13905: You've really helped me to regain my faith in humanity.
13906: And given your track record and breadth of talents, I would ask another favor of you.
13907: And just as before, this will be handled via Records of Eminence. Have to make sure all the Is are dotted and the Ts crossed, as you know.
13908: For you see, the fiends I hunt are not just limited to Aradjiah.
13909: Although it does seem they aimed to break a particular seal...
13910: ...this time they aim to lay claim to the World Eater Egg. No, this simply will not do.
13911: This goes directly against the will of my master, and I shall suffer none to cross him.
13912: I trust you will vanquish this threat with all due haste.
13913: We're counting on you, hero.
13914: Pleasure as always, <Player>.
13915: Your fervor in vanquishing those which threaten us all has not gone unappreciated.
13916: Although perhaps you were only assisting me for baubles and glory rather than righteousness and justice, I must thank you all the same.
13917: So without further ado, permit me to introduce you to your next targets.
13918: You are to make for Aydeewa and Arrapago.
13919: It appears that the dead have redoubled their efforts to usher in the egg's hatching, and it has already been brought to the reef.
13920: And if we can hinder their efforts...well, suffice it to say that my lord will be quite pleased indeed.
13921: Though I would normally be content to leave the dead well alone, I fear that his will is indeed absolute in this matter.
13922: Of course, I need not tell you that for every one you strike down two more will doubtless take its place. I can think of no task more Sisyphean.
13923: Were it up to me, I would see the entire place set ablaze.
13924: I must admit that my mental health has taken a turn for the better knowing I can count on you to handle this issue.
13925: I must remain resolute, for it will not be much longer before my plans come to full fruition.
13926: But I am vexed that my comrades--my lord's right-hand troops--have been lax in their reporting of late.
13927: Doubtless they have their hands full. May the will of my lord be done.
13928: Goddesspeed, hero.
13929: Why won't the dead just stay dead? This goes against all our calculations.
13930: Perhaps they fear my lord's wrath and deemed their chances best on this side of the veil.
13931: Ah, my erstwhile friend! You couldn't have arrived at a more fortuitous time.
13932: At risk of sounding like a broken orchestrion, I confess that I require your assistance once more.
13933: I had been under the impression that the dead were set on returning here, to the world of the living--but it appears I was mistaken.
13934: What their true aim is remains yet a mystery, but one thing is certain--their leader possesses an immense power that defies expectations. Their plans must not be allowed to succeed.
13935: I say this not to diminish the vast capabilities of my master, but to demonstrate to you the commitment of my colleagues and I to ensuring that their machinations bear no fruit.
13936: Yet as the field of battle expands, our forces find themselves stretched increasingly thin. Even my master is vexed at where best to concentrate our efforts.
13937: And so my master created--employed--new soldiers to aid in the efforts. Prompt though their reports were, I found the content thereof to be impudent at best.
13938: "Stop yapping and clean up the stragglers. Those are your orders, and you'd best follow them."
13939: The audacity! Whether they are right or not is immaterial--their tone is completely unaccpetable.
13940: Ugh. To think they get to me so easily...
13941: The will of my master is paramount. If we are to clean up the "stragglers," then so be it.
13942: I will fill my charge without fail.
13943: I have taken the liberty of preparing a list of your next targets.
13944: Though information on previous marks was collected by my underlings, this time I have taken it upon myself to collate the necessary materials.
13945: Fear not. It is as accurate as the previous entries. I take my job quite seriously.
13946: It remains to be seen why our foes are mustering their forces here in Vana'diel.
13947: Ah, but you fancy yourself a defender of Vana'diel, do you not? How quaint.
13948: I wish you the best of luck.
13949: What is this? You wish to know if I'm familiar with a black-clad Goblin?
13950: Yes, I have had the displeasure. A more uncouth specimen I have never come across.
13951: But if you're going to wallow in the mud like a pig, then it was only appropriate that I gave them an appropriate porcine companion...so I introduced them to Shami.
13952: Pleasure to see you, <Player>. How are those two pig-headed buffoons doing?
13953: "What buffoons?" Why, Shami and Shemo, of course.
13954: I sent them that accursed Goblin and their accompanying retinue. Filth loves its own kind.
13955: Hahaha... Tell me how that turned out?
13956: Wh-what? Not only were the Goblin team not there, but then Duke Alloces...?
13957: But if the gate is closed, then it stands to reason that Duke Alloces shouldn't even be here!
13958: Ugh. This is why you can never trust anything to a low-level demon.
13959: But setting that small matter aside... You are after more information on the World Eater Egg, are you not?
13960: You must wonder what this means for the baneful dead.
13961: Worry not. I have prepared a list of more targets for you.
13962: Haha... Surely each one you banish brings a little bit more peace back to Vana'diel.
13963: Perhaps you have already surmised my true identity, but it is too late for you to turn back now.
13964: After all, the proverbial contract has already been signed.
13965: Hoho...a deal with the devil is not so easily overturned...at least not without paying the ultimate price.
13966: And with what you now know about some of the world's ugly truths, well...
13967: And that lovely retinue who depends on you oh-so-much will surely come through for you in the end.
13968: And of course, my lord Odin is depending on you as well.
13969: And I'm sure none of us want these targets to be in cahoots with Garazu-Horeizu, correct?
13970: Betrayal will be deemed a failure to fulfill the obligations of your contract. Surely I need not say more.
13971: So keep doing what you do best, and there will be no problems.
13972: Ah, and one last thing. If you try to flee, or tell anyone who we really are, it will not end well for you.
13973: This, too, would be an egregious violation of the terms of our little "agreement."
13974: You see, <Player>, we have eyes and ears in every corner of Vana'diel.
13975: And we are always watching...listening...
13976: Ah, <Player>. Somehow, I knew you would come.
13977: The sealing of the gate has been quite the catalyst. Wouldn't you agree?
13978: My understanding is that you are working together with Skokkr to reforge the Prime Weapons, are you not?
13979: My understanding is that you have worked together with Skokkr and succeeded in reforging a Prime Weapon, have you not?
13980: I wish you all the best in your journey to vanquish Chaos. After all, the Prime Weapons are the keys.
13981: Your Prime Weapon holds the key to besting Chaos, as you doubtless already know.
13982: But I would advise you one thing: the Prime Weapons belong to my master, and my master alone.
13983: And when they return to him, I have no doubt that they will make their way into my hands...as my just reward for all I have accomplished.
13984: Oh, yes. The time for me to wield the Prime Weapons is close at hand.
13985: In fact, this puts me in the mood for a rousing tale. A secondhand tale, so I leave the analysis of its veracity to you.
13986: 5000 years ago, the Prime Weapons were made manifest after an eternity of trial and error.
13987: Those in charge searched endlessly for a way to figure out how to stop Chaos from devouring the astral plane.
13988: Of course, that was eons ago, so the exact time frame isn't clear, but I am led to believe that over one hundred years of effort were poured into this endeavor.
13989: It started with research into souls that hungered for more. A contract between them was established.
13990: But those initial results were...disappointing. More pure souls were required.
13991: I need not spell out for you what that implied.
13992: Many souls were snuffed out on the altar of progress, irrevocably removed from the cycle of life and death.
13993: And that is how those involved eventually arrived at the idea of imbuing souls into implements of power.
13994: If those souls are angered or cry out for vengeance, well...I'm sure that manifests itself in the potency of the armament.
13995: Perhaps that is why the Prime Weapons gleam with that beautiful obsidian light.
13996: Why, it is positively inspiring! Surely you wish to brandish them in battle even more than before.
13997: Ah, but we have time for one more tale. You know of the relic weapons, correct?
13998: My master conceived them during Ragnarok, and they contain the souls of the enlightened races.
13999: My master chose only the strongest from among those who proffered themselves up in his service.
14000: They cried out for succor. Who were we to deny them?
14001: Why, we were even able to help them defend their kingdoms, although perhaps in a different way than they had envisioned.
14002: Not that those nations exist anymore, mind you.
14003: That is enough stories for one day.
14004: I trust you found it a pleasant enough diversion, but now I bid you return to the task at hand.
14005: My success is linked to your success, after all. And I have new targets for you to hunt.
14006: Yes...I can feel it. The Prime Weapons will soon be mine to wield...
14007: Elijah smiles at you.
14008: Elijah begins laughing boisterously!
14009: <Player>. I must confess, I thought you had forgotten about me.
14010: We are at our watershed moment. I promise to be brief.
14011: As you are eminently aware, Garazu-Horeizu is on the move.
14012: Of course, we have no choice but to answer in kind.
14013: Yet moving too hastily has caused the downfall of many, so I would ask for your aid once more.
14014: The first issue is dealing with the defectors amongst the beastmen who have joined forces with Chaos.
14015: Unfortunately, their contingent is present not only in the Middle Lands, but Aht Urhgan and the Far East as well.
14016: With the enemy spread out across the world, I have had to dispatch some of my most loyal retainers to the far reaches of the globe.
14017: While they are dealing with the threat above, you will deal with Garazu-Horeizu at the gate between this world and the next.
14018: Of course, this will allow the gate to be opened.
14019: I will take up the rear guard, so you have not to fear.
14020: Ah, but perhaps you are concerned that my protection alone may prove insufficient.
14021: Are you concerned? [Of course!/Of course not!]
14022: Then we shall continue along the same path we have traveled to date.
14023: Oho. I may not have a Prime Weapon, but I promise that my skills are more than sufficient.
14024: Then we have our tasks. Let us see them through.
14025: This is our watershed moment. We must defeat Garazu-Horeizu and his minions.
14026: Best of luck to us all.
14027: <Player>. It has been a spell, hasn't it?
14028: You did well in ridding us of Garazu-Horeizu and Chaos.
14029: I would venture to say that your performance exceeded my wildest expectations.
14030: So much so, in fact, that I find myself at a bit of a loss.
14031: The original plan involved my master having a bit more of a...pivotal role in the aftermath, so to speak.
14032: But you kept all the best parts for yourself.
14033: Still, he was quite pleased with how you presented yourself during the entire ordeal.
14034: And my efforts were rewarded in turn, as I have been permitted to remain in this world for a spell.
14035: A curse in disguise, if you will, for I had hoped to return to his side.
14036: Yet you deserve to know a little bit more...perhaps my true name. Consider it a gift.
14037: I am Markgraf Eligos, and I serve as one of Odin's elite.
14038: May our relationship remain as fruitful going forward as it has been to date.
14039: Yes, "going forward," as I still have the usual tasks for you to fulfill.
14040: Though Garazu-Horeizu no longer poses a threat, his hypnosis magic has still not completely dissipated from the land.
14041: And given the details of our pact, that means you still have your end to hold up.
14042: The pact cannot be broken, but rest assured that you will continue to be rewarded.
14043: The terms should be familiar to you by now. Continue to serve.
14044: And just to reiterate--there is no way to escape your obligation.
14045: I wish you the best of luck...
14046: ...and trust you will continue to meet the terms of our deal.
14047: Keep at it.
14048: Good day, <Player>.
14049: It seems you have been quite busy cleaning up the riff-raff.
14050: The A.M.A.N. has reported to me that your data has come in quite handy--and that you have filled all the tasks I have required of you.
14051: What's this? You wish to discuss it further?
14052: Ah, you wish to receive additional rewards for vanquishing what threats remain. I see, I see.
14053: And you have been unsuccessful in your efforts to procure such rewards, no?
14054: For when you defeat them, they keep coming back?
14055: Forgive me for laughing, but you are aware that you are asking for rewards for killing that which is already dead.
14056: They are of a different world than ours, after all, and trapping them in this one is a fool's errand.
14057: But I do admire your gumption.
14058: I am not an unreasonable man. If you are able to best them again if and when they should appear in our plane, then who am I to deny you an extra prize?
14059: Then I shall prepare some more objectives for you to sink your teeth into. That strikes me as fair, wouldn't you agree?
14060: Let us set the rate: one additional reward for every three objectives completed.
14061: After all, what adventurer does not love rewards, hmm? Just don't get yourself offed in the process.
14062: Oh, yes, and be aware that the additional reward can only be earned monthly (Earth time).
14063: Just keep doing what you're doing.
14064: Good day, <Player>.
14065: Oh, worry not. Your achievements have not gone without notice.
14066: Here are your additional rewards.
14067: May our paths cross again soon.
14068: Good day, <Player>.
14069: "Additional rewards?" Surely you do not think you have earned any.
14070: Remember that your contract with me must be carried out in full.
14071: Good day, <Player>.
14072: You may consider your monthly duties filled. As always, your support is greatly appreciated.
14073: Hopefully our paths will cross again next month.
14074: Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Rolandienne in Southern San d'Oria (G-10).
14075: Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Isakoth in Bastok Markets (E-11).
14076: Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Fhelm Jobeizat in Windurst Woods (J-10).
14077: Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Eternal Flame in Western Adoulin (H-11).
14078: Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Nantoto in Lower Jeuno (H-8).
14079: Invisible eyes upon you cause the hairs on the back of your neck to rise.
14080: The $3 nods in agreement.
14081: A new Records of Eminence objective is now available!
14082: A new Records of Eminence objective, "$0," is now available!
14083: You wish to exchange your sparks?
14084: Wait but a moment. Here, follow this command--er, compendium to the letter and you should be able to learn a thing or two.
14085: Ah, this almost slipped my mind. Should you receive any distinct sorts of artifacts for completing an objective, I will be happy to take them off your hands.
14086: Worry not, for I am not out to rob you of your glory. Quite the opposite, in fact. I will provide you with a worthwhile reward for collecting them.
14087: Thanks to your donation, I now have $1 $0 in safekeeping.
14088: Ohohoho... Turning in sparks, I see.
14089: Hold your hoarder hares, [hero/heroine]. I love your enthusiasm, but you're not going to learn a thing without a primer. Ahhh, here it is. Have a look-see.
14090: Oh, crud, that's right. You should trade me any special artifacts you get from completing objectives.
14091: "Why?" What a good question! Because I'll give you a nifty-difty reward at some point, that's why.
14092: Thanks for doing what I asked. Now I have a total of $1 $0 from you.
14093: You want to trrrade in sparks, do you?
14094: Let me wake up from my catnap first... Alright, now rrread this.
14095: Wait, wait, wait! If you happen to get any purrrticularly interesting items from completing objectives, send them my way.
14096: Don't worry, I'm as honest as a cat when the meat's out of reach. I thought of taking them all for myself...
14097: ...but I don't want to make fur fly with the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network, so I'll do my job like a good little kitty.
14098: Grrreat! Now I have $1 $0 from you. Thanks!
14099: Hm? Oh, spark exchange... Of course.
14100: I'm not completely sure, but this might help set some things straight...I guess.
14101: Let me add one thing. Please find it within your heart of hearts to give me anything of particular interest you get from completing objectives.
14102: I'll make it worth your while...I swear! Just keep at it and I'll be sure to surprise you with a hot, steaming helping of gratitude one day.
14103: Thanks for doing your part in the battle for love and peace! With this latest addition, I'm now keeping track of $1 $0 for you.
14104: "Records of Eminence is a system brought to you by the caring folks at the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network. Set your own objectives whenever you desire, and fulfill them to receive compensation.
14105: "To set these tasks, select 'Objective List' from the Quests menu, then choose ones that suit your fancy.

14107: "Completed objectives will vanish from your quest list unless they are repeatable. In the event that you wish to make room for different objectives, you will need to remove them manually.
14108: "As a corollary regarding rewards, you'll be blessed with special remuneration once you complete several objectives. Bask in the joy of these pleasant surprises when you can.
