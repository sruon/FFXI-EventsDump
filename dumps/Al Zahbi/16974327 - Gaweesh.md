## String References

- **7891**: Hey, you! You better not step a fraction closer to Lady Najelith.
- **7892**: Commander Najelith may be young, but she is one of the greatest bowmasters in all of Urhguum. She is also the great General of the Galeserpent. You must act with dignity and respect around her.
- **7893**: The great Najelith has been taken by the enemy!
- **7894**: We may still have a chance, though. The beastmen are known to capture anyone that might be of use and keep them as prisoners...
- **7900**: Hm? You have some questions about General Najelith?
- **7901**: Impudent dog. Did you think I'd sell her secrets to the first rumormonger to flash his coin purse?
- **7902**: No? You're here with an introduction from Biyaada?
- **7903**: And you mean to immortalize our Galeserpent General in song!? It's about time she was honored with a proper tribute!
- **7904**: I would suggest speaking with the general herself. She's much more approachable than you might expect.
- **7905**: You'll often find her in the Wajaom Woodlands during her off-duty hours.
- **7906**: People say she spends her time there staring sadly at some arrow...
- **7907**: It has me slightly worried, to tell the truth.
