- **8067**: Then you must have been in shock when he passed away. It was all so sudden...
- **8068**: He was one of those rare leaders whose will lined up with that of the people. Compared to him, the current Empress is...well, just a little less agreeable, shall we say? Do not mention so to anyone else, though...
- **8069**: You have never heard of Emperor Jalzahn!? He was Emperor until four years ago, when he left the mortal realm. His wife followed him shortly thereafter.
- **8070**: During their lifetimes, the Emperor and Empress often mingled with the people of the Empire, even coming as far as the Commoners' Ward for visits. They were greatly loved by the public, and we always looked forward to seeing them...
