- **8020**: I see... So Eight of Clubs regained the memory of his master's death...
- **8021**: <Sigh>... That's why I told you to mind your own businessy. Now Eight of Clubs has to live with this painful knowledge.
- **8022**: Chancing upony the two Cardians that fateful day and seeing their suffering, I did what I thought was besty to free them from grief.
- **8023**: But it looks to have been to little avail--the memory was lying latent just beneathy the surface this whole time.
- **8024**: After I erased Eight of Clubs' memory and returned to him his $3, he took off without so much as a wordy.
- **8025**: That he was still driven to carry out his late master's commandy to remain at his post... Such devotion brings a tear to my eye.
- **8027**: Eight of Hearts...
- **8029**: To be honest, I'm not certain anymore. It's...about the mystery person who patrols your head.
- **8031**: What...?

- **8037**: That he still retains memory of his late master's final command shows he's more resilienty than most, but I'm worried about him nevertheless.
- **8045**: Eight of Clubs said that? <Sigh> This lifts a heavy weighty off my tiny Taru chest...
- **8046**: In the end, though, I didn't have the heart to reveal the truthy to this one.
- **8047**: I know better now than to deny him the knowledge of his late master.
- **8048**: But I think the truth can wait for a while longery before being let out of the bag.
- **8049**: Perhaps a time will come when Eight of Hearts will be ready to learny all.
- **8050**: Until that day, I intendy to stay by his side and ensure that he never wants for peace of mind.
