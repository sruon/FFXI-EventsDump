## String References

- **8179**: Well met, wayfarer. I am in the midst of investigating the behavioral patterns of wyverns.
- **8180**: Should you learn something of these diabolical creatures in your journeys--anything at all--I would be glad for that information.
- **8181**: What's that? You've obtained intelligence regarding wyverns via a Goblin, you say? Please, you must share this knowledge with me!
- **8182**: Your source tells you the fiends have been "[waaay agitated/a tad alarmed/in good humor] lately"?
- **8183**: This information should prove useful in my endeavors. Please accept this with my thanks.
- **8184**: Should you learn anything new regarding wyverns, I ask that you relay the intelligence to me with the utmost haste. Lives are depending on it.
- **8190**: Ah, I had been wondering when next you would come this way. First of all, allow me to thank you for the day past.
- **8191**: Now, it shames me to have to request your aid again so soon, but I beg you to listen to our plight. Limited in resources and options as we are, my people and I need all the help we can get.
- **8192**: My quest for intelligence on wyverns--it was for no other purpose than to defeat an even fouler fiend, a fearsome hydra called Alfard.
- **8193**: This is the very creature that, in one fell swoop, laid waste to the Republican Army...and forever changed my father.
- **8194**: Alfard is invariably seen in the company of wyverns, which appear to act as bodyguards of sorts.
- **8195**: To attempt battling the creatures simultaneously would be tantamount to suicide. But if we could somehow remove the wyverns from the picture, we just might stand a chance of victory--of survival.
- **8196**: And so I beseech your aid. For the sake of the survivors, will you assist us by defeating the wyverns?
- **8197**: Defeat the wyverns? [Consider it done!/Sounds awfully dangerous...]
- **8198**: Now that we're armed with vital knowledge of the wyverns' habits, the remaining task is straightforward.
- **8199**: I believe you have what it takes to strike down the savage creatures and restore hope to the downtrodden folk who now call this wilderness home.
- **8200**: With Zeid's inspiring presence, the survivors have managed to cling on to a sense of cohesion and mutual purpose. Yet more needs to be done.
- **8201**: I shall begin making provisions for our forces to deal with Alfard.
- **8202**: Once you have seen to the wyverns, I ask you to bring me $0 as proof of the deed. Luck ride with you!
- **8203**: You truly did it! You defeated the wyverns!
- **8204**: I cannot thank you enough, friend. The most grueling stage of the operation lies ahead of us still, but your valorous exploits have stoked the fires of our courage.
- **8205**: Should we succeed in vanquishing Alfard from these rolling knolls, hope will bloom within the people's hearts once more. And then perhaps Father might...
- **8206**: It...it is nothing. My thanks again, wayfarer. No words or objects would suffice to show my appreciation, but I want you to accept this all the same.
- **8207**: I've received intelligence that wyvern numbers are on the rise. Needless to say, the fiends must not be permitted to continue their reign of terror. Can we rely on your assistance once more, friend?
- **8208**: Is that so? For the sake of mankind, I pray that you reconsider.
- **8209**: You have our eternal gratitude, friend. Now, you go to face opponents you have previously bested, but on no account lower your guard, lest you succumb to your own complacency.
- **8210**: What? Do my ears play tricks? I-I dare not hope... Could you truly have...vanquished Alfard?
- **8211**: I...I can scarce believe what I'm hearing! Oh, Father will be over the moon to hear these tidings!
- **8212**: Why, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if he were to hold an award ceremony in your honor on the morrow!
- **8213**: ...
- **8214**: Forgive me, I...I let myself get carried away. The good hope of your news put me in mind of former times. I don't believe I ever went into detail about Father's condition.
- **8215**: When the Abyssean hordes overran the Republic, in the span of but a few hours, Father witnessed enough bloodshed to last ten-score lifetimes.
- **8216**: Blaming himself for the deaths of the citizens--for failing to protect them as was his charge--he fell into a spiral of depression. Now he wages an ongoing struggle in the depths of his soul.
- **8217**: Truth be told, I'm deathly afraid...afraid of the pain and suffering that my inadequate leadership could cost us. Sometimes the responsibility is simply too much for these shoulders alone to bear. Oh, it'd give me so much heart if Father could return to his old self again...
- **8218**: P-please forgive me. I didn't mean to burden you with my insecurities.
- **8219**: I know full well that I must stay strong. After all, everyone--not the least of all, Father--is depending on me.
- **8246**: The Abyssean hordes press us with unnerving ferocity. Our defenses are on the verge of collapse.
- **8247**: Please, you must help us repel the enemy! Our very survival is at stake!
- **8248**: Does the enemy's thirst for destruction know no bounds? We beat them back time and again, yet there seems to be no end to them.
- **8249**: If only we can gain enough purchase in the struggle to launch an offensive...
- **8250**: We've begun to gain ground against the enemy. Now is the time to strike such a blow that would send the fiends scurrying back to their lairs!
- **8251**: Our valiant soldiers are pressing the enemy hard.
- **8252**: Let us continue to rally together and show the Abyssean fiends the power of unity!
- **8253**: Our tenacity and strength of spirit have seen the Abyssean threat defanged! Let us see to it that the enemy is permitted no means to rise again!
