## String References

- **7421**: You see a message engraved on the stone:
- **7422**: Here where the warm Garuda winds blow, rolanberries are cultivated in great orchards.
- **7423**: These berries are famous for their sharp, tingling tartness. And it's not just the Galka who appreciate a rolanberry pie to cleanse the palate after a meal.
- **7424**: These humble berries also warm the hearts of carnivorous beastmen, and guards have been posted against Goblin thieves and Yagudo raiders.
- **7425**: The most valuable berries are stockpiled by insects, who use a special secretion to store them. This results in an exceptionally tart preserve, popular with connoisseurs.
- **7426**: The village of Jeuno has benefited greatly from the harvests here, and the bounty of the sea. They seem well on their way to statehood. --Gwynham Ironheart, 757 Crystal Era.
