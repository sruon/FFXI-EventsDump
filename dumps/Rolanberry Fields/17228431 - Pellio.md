## String References

- **6413**: Obtained: #.
- **12423**: Ugh. Every single day I toil on these farms, with no time left for studies of my own.
- **12424**: You see, I'm researching how to reliably produce white rolanberries, but with all my time being taken up with helping my father here, I'm afraid my progress is a bit stalled.
- **12425**: But you--you look like you've got some free time on your hands. Can you bring me some rolanberries?
- **12426**: If you bring me the right stuff, I'll give you some of my precious white rolanberries--the fruits of my labor.
- **12427**: Of course, I might not be satisfied with what you've procured, and I'll have to ask you to try again. But that's what being an adventurer is all about, no?
- **12428**: So just keep bringing me those rolanberries, as long as it takes!
- **12429**: The older the rolanberries are, the more likely they'll have the qualities I seek. Now get to it!
- **12430**: Yes! $1! This is exactly what I need.
- **12431**: Thanks so much! This'll be the perfect supplement to my research.
- **12432**: White rolanberries are really elusive, and we're not exactly sure what causes them to develop in such a way.
- **12433**: They're malms sweeter than ordinary rolanberries, and fans of the fruit will pay out the nose for them. That's why I'm looking for a surefire way to cultivate these delicacies.
- **12434**: Progress has been slow, because rolanberry cultivation is a years-long process.
- **12435**: Jeuno used to be a haven for such pursuits, but with the passage of time the indutsry started to fade.
- **12436**: I suppose the city's vitality in recent years has been thanks to adventurers more than farmers.
- **12437**: And, of course, farming is an industry gravely affected by the ravages of war, and such fruits were deemed a luxury item rather than a necessity.
- **12438**: But white rolanberries--those are a game changer!
- **12439**: I know we can revitalize farming here in Jeuno if only I could make a breakthrough! Think of the untold riches I would have!
- **12440**: If only my father knew how close I was, then maybe he would let me focus on that rather than sitting here pulling weeds.
- **12441**: But there's not much other fertile land in the area, and the more we expand the more tedious my labor becomes.
- **12442**: That's why I think we should focus on producing a small amount of high-quality goods. Quality over quantity. Added value drives the market, after all!
- **12443**: Here's a token of my appreciation. Hopefully you'll find their taste to be as exquisite as I do!
- **12444**: Hmm...this is an ordinary rolanberry, but I do sense something special about it.
- **12445**: You've worked hard to bring it to me. That much I can tell. I'll accept it, but just this once.
- **12446**: Here's a little something for your help, but next time you'll need to bring me something a little more ripe.
- **12447**: Let me take a look. Let's see if this is what I need.
- **12448**: No, no no. This is no good at all. Even though you may think all $1 are the same, I can tell even the smallest difference. Try again!
- **12449**: If you want one of my rare white rolanberries, you'll need to get me something I can use in my research.
- **12450**: Let's see...this is just an ordinary one!
- **12451**: I guess I'll take it off your hands, but I really don't need any more. Bring me the oldest rolanberries you can find.
- **12452**: I'm talking really, really ripe ones. Say it with me. "Ripe!" Maybe next time you'll get it right.
