## String References

- **7468**: This used to be the secret place where young lovers met. Qiji and I used to come here, too, before we moved in together.
- **7469**: People say the drawbridge is getting old, but it looks as sturdy to me as the first time I laid eyes on it. If anything has changed, it must be something within us...
- **7540**: My! $7, for me? Why, that's very nice of you!
- **7541**: Qiji, look at what this nice person gave me! And you haven't given me a present in ages! Shame on you!
- **7543**: Thank you very much! I've wanted one of these for the longest time. It's as if you read my mind!
- **7546**: Yes? Of course I know that present was from my husband, dear. He thinks I'm hard of hearing, but he's the one who can't even hear himself talk!
- **7547**: In fact, this isn't the first time he's done this. But you know what? It's a wonderful thing to receive a gift from someone who loves you, no matter how many times, or how old you are.
- **7548**: I should give Qiji something back for his present this time, too. Would you be kind enough to go find me $7, dear?
- **7549**: Oh, and don't worry, I can give them to him myself. Men are such cowards!
- **7550**: Ah, you've brought them. Thank you. Here's something for you.
- **7552**: Oh, don't be foolish, Qiji. This nice person just brought me what I asked for--a present from me to you. Here.
- **7554**: Yes, yes... Ah, here, take this. Thank you again.
- **7555**: Oh, and...one more thing. Seeing or hearing things the same way isn't important. Sharing the same moments in your life is.
- **7556**: Qiji told me that when he proposed to me. I'd like to think that's why we're still together.
