## String References

- **7309**: What am I to do... Hmm? You want to help me? Good! I was waiting for someone to offer!
- **7310**: I have a guest coming in from Jeuno. Since we've never met before, I thought I should hold something noticeable so he could find me...but I might have chosen something a little too bizarre.
- **7311**: I told him I'd bring $7, but I realized later I don't even own $7! Whatever possessed me to tell him that?
- **7312**: I'm busy preparing his welcoming feast, so I'd like you to find $7 and meet him at the air travel agency in my place. And when you find him--rather, when he finds you--bring him to me. Can you do it?
- **7313**: Go greet Powhatan's guest in his place? [Yes./No.]
- **7314**: Good, good! My guest's name is Evrain. He's a young Hume white mage. To work, then, to work!
- **7315**: You won't go? Ah, then what am I to do...?
- **7316**: Hmm? Yes? Was there something you didn't understand?
- **7317**: What do you want to ask him? [Where can I find $7?/Where am I supposed to meet your guest?/Nothing.]
- **7318**: I've heard someone say some Quadav wear $7 sometimes...does that help?
- **7319**: You can't find him? He should be coming through the arrival gate of the air travel agency...
- **7320**: If he's not there, you might want to ask the receptionist at the counter. His flight may have been delayed.
- **7321**: Ah, you're back! Thanks to you, I was able to meet Mister Evrain! Here, take this as a token of my gratitude.
- **7322**: What am I to do... Hmm? You want to help me? Ah, it's you again! Good, I was waiting for you to offer!
- **7323**: I'm expecting another guest from Jeuno--and I've done it again! I told him I'd be holding the most bizarre thing...
- **7324**: I said I'd be holding $7! I don't even own $7! Now, whatever possessed me to say that?
- **7325**: I'm busy preparing his welcoming feast, so...I'd like you to find $7 and meet him at the air travel agency in my place. And when you find him--rather, when he finds you--bring him to me. Can you do it?
- **7326**: Go greet Powhatan's guest in his place? [Yes./No.]
- **7327**: Good, good! My guest's name is Domien. He's an Elvaan knight. To work, then, to work!
- **7328**: You won't go? The last time was enough for you? I'm sorry to hear that... What am I to do, then?
- **7329**: Hmm? Yes? Something you didn't understand?
- **7330**: What do you want to ask him? [Where can I find $7?/Where am I supposed to meet your guest?/Nothing.]
- **7331**: To tell you the truth, I don't know. But I've heard of $7 many times before, so it shouldn't be an uncommon item. That's probably why I told Sir Domien I'd be holding one!
- **7332**: You can't find him? Oh, no! He must've already arrived! He's probably wandering, lost, and trying to find me!
- **7333**: Please go find him! He should still be in this district, but if he's wandered off to the Bastok Markets, ask the guards there if they've seen him!
- **7334**: Ah, you're back! Where is Sir Domien? What!? He gave you this letter and left in a fury!?
- **7335**: Oh, no! What am I to do? ...Still, you've done what I've asked you to do, and I feel I still owe you for the last time. Here, take this.
