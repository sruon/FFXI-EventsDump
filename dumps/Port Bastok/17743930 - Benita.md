## String References

- **7505**: My neighbor Ensetsu's daughter, Ayame, is quite a remarkable girl. Have you met her yet?
- **7506**: She's always been very bright. She became a samurai when she was little, and now she made it to the top and became a Mythril Musketeer!
- **7507**: Only the top five Musketeers can join their ranks, you know. Ensetsu must be proud that Ayame was chosen to be one!
- **7508**: Now, if only her sister Kaede were a little more like her. She's so quiet and unremarkable...but I suppose children should be seen and not heard.
- **7509**: I never see much of Corann... Oh, that's the son of my neighbor Ronan. I think he stays cooped up in his room all day.
- **7510**: He's like a turtle in its shell... So much so that some people even say that the turtle people cast a curse on him when he was born!
- **7635**: Take my word for it, housework is not easy. Especially clearing clogged chimneys--that takes up a whole day!
- **7636**: Hmm... I remember my mother-in-law telling me there was an item that cleared chimneys in a flash, but what was it, I wonder? Do you know?
- **7640**: Is this it? This can clear chimneys? My mother-in-law said so?
- **7641**: Hmm...I guess I faintly remember her talking about it. Oh well, as long as it works. Here's something for your trouble.
