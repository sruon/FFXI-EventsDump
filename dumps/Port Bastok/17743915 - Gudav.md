## String References

- **7466**: There's nothing to see here. Just another forgotten Hume project, where we Galka did all the work and were left with nothing to show for our sweat and toil.
- **7519**: This is such a great location... I wish the Humes hadn't dropped the whole project.
- **7520**: You should've seen us when the foreman was still here! We were busy like bees, but happy as lambs to take part in this big project. But look at us now.
- **7521**: The foreman took it the hardest. He disappeared when the project was canceled. I think his dog went with him, too.
- **7522**: I wonder what happened to him? It's still a little too early for him to have left on his journey of rebirth...
- **7523**: Say, you're an adventurer, aren't you? Can you tell me if you hear anything about our foreman or his dog?
- **7527**: Hey...the foreman's dog used to wear this collar. What would an undead cur--in North Gustaberg, of all places--be doing with it?
- **7528**: Some say that when you die, the regret you have about things you left undone could turn you into an undead, but...is this possible?
- **7529**: If that was the foreman's dog you fought, then that would mean the foreman is also...
- **7530**: No, he cannot be. He must have already reincarnated into a new body. He used to say that this project might be his last job...
- **7531**: I just wish we could've finished it, for the foreman's sake.
- **7532**: In any case, I should thank you for this bit of news, be it good or ill. Here, take this. It isn't much, but it should come in handy.
