## String References

- **12676**: The previous Adventurer Appreciation Campaign was a resounding success, kupo! However, there were a lot of people who didn't have the opportunity to collect their $0.
- **12677**: It wouldn't be fair if those poor souls missed out on such an incredible item, so I've brought a whole new bag of them!
- **12678**: Ah, but my list shows that you already received a ring. I'm sorry, <Player>. I am not allowed to give you a new one, kupo!
- **12679**: Hrmmm... It looks like you weren't registered with the MHMU at the time of the campaign. I'm sorry, but I'm not allowed to give newcomers a ring.
- **12680**: Oh, and my list shows that you haven't received $0 yet, kupo! Here, you can have this one, but be careful not to throw it away, as you'll never be able to get another...ever!
