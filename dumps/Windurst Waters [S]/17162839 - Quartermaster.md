- **12412**: Nice job on your last operation. Now don't forget to report back to Emhi Tchaoryo!
- **12413**: It seems that you were not successful in your last operation. But do not let one small failure hang heavy on your soul. Report to Sir Rasdinice and put this all behind you.
- **12414**: Weren't so lucky during that last operation, were you? Well, don't worry about it too much. Report to First Centurion Hieronymus and get some rest, soldier.
- **12415**: Hmmm... Didn't do so well on that last operation, did you? I know it's hard, but it's better if you're up-front about these things. If you know what's good for you, you'll hurry down and report to Emhi Tchaoryo before the major finds out first.
- **12416**: Make haste, <Player>. Sir Rasdinice awaits your report!
- **12417**: What are you waiting for, <Player>? Report to First Centurion Hieronymus on the double!

- **12661**: You are to appropriate $3 $0$0 from the enemy. This is a very dangerous mission, but, if successful, will help weaken the hordes significantly.
- **12662**: You are to collect a mere $3 $0$0 . If you cannot manage that, you might want to reconsider your participation in our forces.
- **12663**: Unfortunately, our forces on the frontlines require a constant flow of rations to maintain their strength. Bring me $3 $0$0 and I will make sure that they are distributed properly.
- **12664**: Unfortunately, our forces are running low on medicine. To prevent the further loss of any life, I need you to procure $3 $0$0 .

- **12679**: This is not the full order, <Player>. However, I'll accept what you have. Next time, make sure to procure all the items requested of you. Dismissed!
- **12680**: I do not believe this is what your mission orders specify, <Player>.
- **12681**: You the new temporay raid recruit? Alright, listen up, soldier! I'm gonna keep this short and simple, so's you can understand it real good-like. The sole purpose of your existence is to attack Beastman supply divisions and seize any viable cargo!

- **12683**: You are to infiltrate said area and promptly locate and dispatch said enemy. You are then to proceed to acquire any and all enemy-held supplies and return here with them. Is that understood, soldier!?
