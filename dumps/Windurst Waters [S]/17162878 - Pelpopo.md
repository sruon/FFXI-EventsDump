## String References

- **12735**: You must be the scout I heard would be sent my way, yes? Very well, here you are, then.
- **12737**: Do you know very well about fiendtrappers? [Not very well, no./Very well, yes.]
- **12738**: Well I suppose that's to be expected. Very well, listen up. It's a magical device that is still in the early testing stages. It's capable of capturing images at the press of a button. Very well designed, it is.
- **12739**: Using it will cause the image of whatever you happen to be pointing it at to be very well recorded to a blank fiend plate located within. Isn't that something?
- **12740**: Very well, now. Your mission is to take this and gather some images of those ne'er-do-well Yagudo fiends!
- **12741**: Oh, very well, then. You may already know your mission objective very well then, yes? You are to take this and gather some images of those ne'er-do-well Yagudo fiends!
- **12743**: You can't very well be galavanting about here all day if you hope to complete your mission. Go and sniff out those Yagudo!
- **12744**: I've already perused that data very well. You had best take it directly to Emhi Tchaoryo.
- **12745**: I can't very well have you interrupting me unless it's of the utmost importance. I'm quite busy here.
