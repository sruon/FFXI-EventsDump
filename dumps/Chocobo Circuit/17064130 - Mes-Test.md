- **9691**: Come on!!!
- **9692**: Go, go, go!!!
- **9693**: The outcome is exactly as I had feltaru! The vibe never lies!
- **9694**: Boohoo, how disappointing... I guess the vibes weren't so strong this time. But I'll be back!
- **9695**: Off I go to the chocobet center.
- **9696**: Now, let me sneak a peek at the lineup... Hohoho, this will be a breeze! $0-$1 are my picks for the day.
- **9697**: Hey, you there. $2 quill[/s] for $0-$1, and be quick about it. Gil, you say? You'll have your gil, so just hand me my numbers!
- **9698**: Now, off I go to watch the race.
- **9699**: Hmmm? Interested in my numbers, are you? I don't make it a habit to share my picks with people, but just for you: "ID$3:$0-$1".
- **9700**: As a merchant, my hobby is to observe people where they gather, in order to sharpen my skills in observation. A merchant is nothing without well honed observation skills!
- **9701**: Oh my Goddess...
- **9702**: Aaaaaah...
- **9703**: Hohoho, another fine win indeed! My oh my, how ever will I carry all this extra gil? Off I go to buy myself an extra gil pouch!
- **9704**: "To err is Hume"... Some folk find that hard to swallow, but it's the reason why life is so interesting, don't you agree? Now, off I go to win back what I just lost!
- **9705**: Hmph... Of all the race circuits in Vana'diel, why did I have to come all the way here? And where did that pompous old butler run off to!?
- **9706**: Hmph... What? Gil only? I checked in a whole hoard of gold at reception, so just take what you need from there. Do I have to tell you how to do your job?
- **9707**: Cash only!? Hmph... Give me $2 quill[/s] for $0-$1. But more importantly, have you seen my butler skulking around here somewhere? No? Hmph... You're as useless as he is.
- **9708**: Hmph! Now I'm really getting annoyed... Gimaulle! Where are you!?
- **9709**: Hey, give me some personal space here. I'm not interested in seeing your nose hairs, okay? You just want to know my numbers, huh? "ID$3:$0-$1", satisfied?
- **9710**: Hmph... That cursed butler even has my gil pouch...
- **9711**: Oh, a race is about to start!
- **9712**: <Yawn> Talk about boring. My SilverChariot would blitz the entire field.
- **9713**: For your information, I'm a chocobo breeder myself. A passing glance is more than enough for me to discern a chocobo's pedigree. Anything less than a winning pick would be an embarrassment.
- **9714**: Now, for the last blooming time, Gimaulle!!! Where in blazes are you!?
- **9715**: Hmph! Thanks to my butler's disappearing act, I couldn't concentrate on my picks! Gimaulle!!! You're really going to get it now!
- **9716**: Milady! To where could she have possibly disappeared?
- **9717**: Her own SilverChariot is about to take to the field...
- **9718**: You there, you will give me $2 quill[/s] for all possible pairings with SilverChariot placed first.
- **9719**: Now, I must needs find milady. Mayhaps she has already proceeded to the spectator stand...
- **9720**: Hmmm? You wish to know the likely outcome of this race? Why, I would not hesitate to wager my entire fortune on milady's SilverChariot!
- **9721**: But there are more pressing matters at hand... I am looking for milady, Phemille, whom I accompanied here. Strikingly beautiful, she is, and wise beyond her years. Have you not seen a person who fits this description? Hmmm...
- **9722**: Aaah, the race has is about to commence! Behold SilverChariot, milady's very own thoroughbred. Not a single chocobo in Vana'diel can rival his magnificence!
- **9723**: My, my, my...
- **9724**: Outstanding! This is indeed the fruit of milady's unrelenting devotion, a testament to her gift for chocobo raising.
- **9725**: Milady never ceases to amaze me. I must needs find her and report the nature of this most delightful victory!
- **9726**: "A cornered rat will bite," or so the saying goes... Mayhaps it was for the best milady did not witness the race.
- **9727**: ...
- **9728**: Hmmm... Nope, none of the others are a match for my MegaFlare.
- **9729**: 'Scuse me, I'd like $2 quill[/s] for all combos with MegaFlare in first place.
- **9730**: Cheers.
- **9731**: What? You wanna know which chocobo's fastest? My MegaFlare, of course!
- **9732**: I've been puttin' my own chocobo raisin' theory to the test in the real world, and so far I'm undefeated in all official races!
- **9733**: Go get 'em, boy!!!
- **9734**: Show 'em whatcha got!!!
- **9735**: Mwahahaha!!! MegaFlare has once again proven my genius!
- **9736**: <Sigh> The higher you climb, the steeper it gets, huh? Looks like its back to the drawin' board for me...
- **9737**: I think it was this way...
- **9738**: Hellooo! Wow...everyone looks fast.
- **9739**: Um, I'd like $2 quill[/s] for my LunarHarvester paired with all the otherrrs, please.
- **9740**: Thanks!
- **9741**: Hey, you want to know which chocobo is fastest? It's my LunarHarvester! I rrraised her myself!
- **9742**: LunarHarvester was my grrrandpa's chocobo's chick. That's why she's so fast!
- **9743**: Oh, the rrrace is about to start!!!
- **9744**: Go LunarHarvester!!! I know you can do it!!!
- **9745**: Yay! Yay! LunarHarvester is the best! I have to go tell Grrrandpa!
- **9746**: S-she lost... Th-this can't be true!
