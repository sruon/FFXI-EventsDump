 6753: My magic is almost gone.
 6754: My magical reserves are running low.
 6755: Nooo... I'm almost out of magic...
 6756: Magic? I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel here...
 6757: My magical reserves are nearing depletion.
 6758: I'm almost out of magic.
 6759: Almost out of magic!
 6760: My magic is running low.
 6761: Where'd all my magic go!?
 6762: My magical reserves are running low.
 6763: My magic will no longer be of much aid. Stay sharp!
 6764: My magic...it's all gone!

 6766: I've just recently gained a level. There's still a lot of work to be done until the next one.
 6767: I've just gained a level. I'm itching to get out and test my newfound strength!
 6768: Take it easy. I've just gained a level.
 6769: I have recently risen in level. The next level is still quite some distance away.
 6770: I've just leveled up, but with your help, it'll take no time at all to get to the next level!
 6771: Hey, I just leveled up, didn't I? Easy on the expectations there, partner.
 6772: Since I have just gained a level, it will be quite some time until I reach the next. Sorry to disappoint you, [sir/milady].
 6773: I've just gained a level. The next level is still quite a way off.
 6774: I just gained a level! You can't expect me to level again any time soon!
 6775: Little time has passed since I last gained a level. The next level is still some distance away.
 6776: I've just gained a level, I know. But I still can't wait until I go up again!
 6777: I have recently risen in level. The next level is still quite some distance away.
 6778: I just leveled up! We'll have to do something about your memory problem.
 6779: It's so farrr away...

 6783: Not even close... I still have much experience to gain.
 6784: There is still much work to be done. I must gain more experience if I am to become stronger.
 6785: I still have to gain lots more experience, but I'll do my best!
 6786: My next level is still ages away. Why hurry? Don't worry, be happy!
 6787: I have made some progress, but the next level still eludes me.
 6788: Not even close... I still have much experience to gain.
 6789: I have lots of work to do! I need more experience if I'm gonna get stronger!
 6790: I still have much to do. I must gain more experience in order to grow stronger.
 6791: Ho-hum. Still lots of work to do until my next level!
 6792: There is still much work to be done. I must gain more experience if I am to become stronger.
 6793: My level won't rise if we stand around talking like this!
 6794: No, don't rrremind me! Such a long way to go...
 6795: [/I've gained a fair amount of experience./I think I must be almost halfway to my next level./Hmm./I believe I've almost reached the halfway point to my next level./I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level./I think I must be almost halfway to my next level./I've come a long way towards my next level./We've been busy, huh?/I believe I've almost reached the halfway point to my next level.] [/I must be close to halfway to my next level by now./Can't slow down now!/I must be almost halfway to my next level by now./Let's not rest on our laurels, however!/That was much faster than I expected./No time to be slacking off!/Must be close to halfway by now./I think I'm almost halfway to my next level./Let's not rest on our laurels, however!]
 6796: I've gained a fair amount of experience. I must be close to halfway to my next level by now.
 6797: I think I must be almost halfway to my next level. Can't slow down now!
 6798: Hmm. I must be almost halfway to my next level by now.
 6799: I believe I've almost reached the halfway point to my next level. Let's not rest on our laurels, however!
 6800: I think I'm about half way there...
 6801: I'm half way there, so let's keep up the pace!
 6802: Through sustained effort and your invaluable assistance, I believe I now stand at the halfway point.
 6803: I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level. That was much faster than I expected.
 6804: I think I must be almost halfway to my next level. No time to be slacking off!
 6805: I've come a long way towards my next level. Must be close to halfway by now.
 6806: We've been busy, huh? I think I'm almost halfway to my next level.
 6807: I believe I've almost reached the halfway point to my next level. Let's not rest on our laurels, however!
 6808: I still haven't acquired enough experience. About double what I have now should be sufficient for the next level.
 6809: I'm halfway there...maybe?

 6812: This is a good pace! Not much more to my next level!
 6813: Hmm. Still need a little more experience for my next level.
 6814: Well, well. It appears my next level is not far off at all.
 6815: I'm slowly getting closer to the next level.
 6816: I reckon I'm fairly close to the next level.
 6817: My next level is now visible on the horizon.
 6818: Just a little more. My next level is not too far away.
 6819: Come on! I need to gain a little more experience for my next level!
 6820: I'm past the halfway point. Not long now until I gain another level.
 6821: Just a little more! My next level is almost within sight!
 6822: Well, well. It appears my next level is not far off at all.
 6823: My next level draws ever nearer. But that doesn't mean you can slack off.
 6824: It can't be so far off, now...can it?
 6825: [/Hmm./I'm almost there./Not long now./Any time now./Well, what do you know?/Woohoo!/This is encouraging./I love this time!/Any time now.] [/I should be gaining a level soon./I can almost taste my next level!/My next level is just around the corner./My next level is very close, indeed./I think I'll be gaining a level soon./I'll be leveling up really soon!/I should be gaining a level any time now./I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!/My next level is very close, indeed.]
 6826: Hmm. I should be gaining a level soon.
 6827: I'm almost there! I can almost taste my next level!
 6828: Not long now. My next level is just around the corner.
 6829: Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
 6830: I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
 6831: Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
 6832: Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
 6833: Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
 6834: Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
 6835: This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
 6836: I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
 6837: Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
 6838: My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
 6839: <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
 6840: I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
 6841: It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
 6842: ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
 6843: It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
 6844: Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
 6845: You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
 6846: You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
 6847: I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
 6848: Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
 6849: I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
 6850: Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
 6851: It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
 6852: There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
 6853: She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee.t The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!t
 6854: Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
 6855: Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
 6856: No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
 6857: Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
 6858: ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
 6859: Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
 6860: While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
 6861: It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
 6862: Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
 6863: I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
 6864: Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
 6865: Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
 6866: If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
 6867: Heal the worrrld.t Make it a better place.t For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.t
 6868: Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
 6869: You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
 6870: ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
 6871: A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
 6872: Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
 6873: You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
 6874: Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
 6875: By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
 6876: Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
 6877: By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
 6878: You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
 6879: A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
 6880: Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
 6881: Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...
 6882: [/Ready?/Keep your eyes open!/I see an opening./Are you ready?/I'm warmed up now./Don't blink now!/Are you ready?/Alrighty!/Are you ready?] [/I'm taking my shot!/You don't wanna miss this!/Get ready to follow up./I'm beginning my attack!/Time for a real attack!/Follow my lead!/I'm taking my shot!/Here goes nothing!/I'm beginning my attack!]

 6911: Defeated enemies? That was number $0.
 6912: So far, we've only taken down $0 [enemy/enemies] today!
 6913: How many enemies have we defeated? Only $0. You can count that high, right...?
 6914: You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? Why, we have only vanquished $0 [foe/foes] so far.
 6915: We haven't defeated many enemies yet. Only $0 so far.
 6916: We've only defeated $0 [enemy/enemies] so far. Nothing to write home about.
 6917: Our progress, [sir/milady]? The last foe bested brings today's tally to $0 [enemy/enemies].
 6918: We've only beaten $0 [enemy/enemies] so far. Don't tell me you're tired already!?
 6919: Only $0 [enemy has/enemies have] fallen to us today! We're just getting started!
 6920: The last enemy we defeated was number $0.
 6921: The last enemy we took down was number $0.
 6922: You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? Why, we have only vanquished $0 [foe/foes] so far.
 6923: Only $0 [enemy/enemies] defeated so far. This doesn't even amount to a warm-up.
 6924: We've beaten at least two...right?
 6925: Defeated enemies? That was number $0.
 6926: I'd say we've blasted through around $0 [enemy/enemies] by now!
 6927: How many enemies have we defeated? Hmm, around $0...
 6928: You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? The last villain we defeated brings us to number $0.
 6929: You want to know how many enemies we've beaten so far? Let me check... It's $0.
 6930: The last one we took care of makes number $0, right? Not too shabby, if I do say so myself.
 6931: Our progress, [sir/milady]? The last foe bested brings today's tally to $0 [enemy/enemies].
 6932: We've defeated about $0 [enemy/enemies] now. That should quieten things down around here!
 6933: I would say we've taken out around $0 [enemy/enemies] by now. Still more work to be done!
 6934: The last enemy we defeated was number $0. As far as I remember.
 6935: How many enemies have we downed? Umm...around $0. I think.
 6936: You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? The last villain we defeated brings us to number $0.
 6937: Our tally stands at a meager $0 enemies. This is unacceptable. We're picking up the pace!
 6938: We've beaten a lot more than three now...prrrobably.
 6939: Defeated enemies? That was number $0, I believe.
 6940: I'm just guessing here, but I'd say we've destroyed about $0 [enemy/enemies] today!
 6941: Enemies defeated? I wasn't really keeping track. Around $0, I suppose...
 6942: You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to $0.
 6943: How many enemies we've defeated? Isn't it something like $0?
 6944: Let's see... So far we've wiped the floor with $0 enemies. Good job!
 6945: The last foe bested brings today's tally to $0 [enemy/enemies]--a most impressive figure. Shall I prepare tea and biscuits?
 6946: We just beat enemy number $0. They just keep coming, don't they?
 6947: The last enemy we took down was number $0...I think.
 6948: That last enemy brings us to a total of $0 [enemy/enemies] defeated. We've been busy.
 6949: Umm, let's see here... We've beaten $0 [enemy/enemies] today, right? I've totally lost count...
 6950: You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to $0.
 6951: We've already rid the land of $0 enemies today, but it doesn't seem to make even the slightest dint in their numbers.

 7370: Your chocobo appeared in a play. The playmaster paid $0 gil for your services.
 7371: What will you do? [Watch over the chocobo./Tell a story./Scold the chocobo./Compete against others./Go on a walk (short)./Go on a walk (regular)./Go on a walk (long)./----/----/----/----/----/----/----/----/----/----/----/----/----/----/----/----/----/----/----/----/----/----/----/----/Nothing.]
 7372: [Watch over the chocobo/Tell a story/Scold the chocobo/Compete against others/Go on a walk (short)/Go on a walk (regular)/Go on a walk (long)]? [Yes./No.]
 7373: You should wait until your chocobo has more energy before doing that...
 7374: If you watch over your chocobo, it will gradually return your affection.
 7375: Telling your chocobo a story will help it develop a healthy psychological state. Remember that concentrating on your speech will have a slightly tiring effect on the animal, though.
 7376: When your chocobo acts stubborn, you must discipline it. Remember that reproof is an act of love. It is important to scold your chocobo the moment it acts up!
 7377: You're interested in entering your chocobo into competitions? Strange...there were three others who mentioned the same thing. Well, it is good for their physical development, after all. I suppose it's alright as long as it's done peacefully.
 7378: Venturing outside of town with your chocobo will improve the bond between the two of you. If you don't wander off too far, your chocobo should not get very tired, either.
 7379: Venturing outside of town with your chocobo will improve the bond between the two of you. You should try wandering out just a bit sometimes. It might tire your chocobo a bit, but could have some positive effects as well.
 7380: Venturing outside of town with your chocobo will improve the bond between the two of you. Wandering far from town on a walk will expose your chocobo to all sorts of new experiences!
 7381: Your chocobo already has a name.
 7382: Choose a word category ([first name/last name]). [1-letter words."-letter words."-letter words./4-letter words./5-letter words./6-letter words./7-letter words./8-letter words./9-letter words./10-letter words./11-letter words./12-letter words./13-letter words./14-letter words./Return./Cancel.]
 7383: Is this name okay? [%0 %1? Yes!/On second thought...]
 7384: That name is currently unavailable. Please try another combination.
 7385: Choose a word.(%0) [$0/$1/$2/$3/$4/$5/$6/$7/$8/$9/$10/$11/$12/$13/$14/$15/$16/$17/$18/$19/$20/$21/$22/$23/$24/$25/$26/$27/$28/$29/Cancel./View other options.]
 7386: F(A=
 7387: $0
 7388: I can issue you a card that contains all your chocobo's important information.
 7389: If you trade the card to the chocobo matchmaking authority in Jeuno, you can match up your animal with other chocobos. You can buy a chococard for $0 gil.
 7390: Purchase a chococard? ($0 gil each) [Yes./Not now.]
 7391: To enter your chocobo in one of the CRA-sanctioned races, you must first receive $0.
 7392: Then, simply trade that document to a CRA agent to complete the registration process.
 7393: Would you like a free form? [Right away!/Maybe later.]
 7394: You can register a chocobo to respond to your call in the field. The chocobo will come to you when you use your $0.
 7395: Your chocobo's registered data determines certain features, such as its saddle, so it is wise to re-register from time to time.
 7396: You can register a retired chocobo by trading $0 to me.
 7397: However, I will require a small fee.
 7398: Register a chocobo? ($0 gil) [Yes./Not now.]
 7399: I shall make the necessary preparations, then.
 7400: I will now register %0 to come when you call.
 7401: I require $0 gil for preparations.
 7402: I shall ready your chocobo, then.
 7403: You lost your $0? Of all the irresponsible...
 7404: Anyway, I can give you a new $0, but you're going to have to pay $1 gil for it.
 7405: Purchase $0? ($1 gil) [Yes./Not now.]
 7406: Hm... This seems to be in great condition! We shouldn't need to do any work on it at the moment.
 7407: Hm... This $2's power to call your chocobo seems to have grown weak...
 7408: For a small fee, I can give you a new $2 in exchange for it if you wish.
 7409: Pay for a new whistle? ($1 gil) [Yes, please./Not yet.]
 7410: Here you go. Take good care of it.
 7411: All right... You can have this back, then.
 7412: I cannot accept a fee from you this time. The $0 is all I require.
 7413: Here, take this.
 7414: Are you sure that you want to stop caring for this chocobo?
 7415: Stop caring for your chocobo? [Yes./No!]
 7416: You will never be able to see your chocobo again. Is that okay with you?
 7417: Understood. Care of your chocobo will transfer to the stables. Do you have any last words?
 7418: What would you like to say? [Nothing./I'm sorry./It's just an animal!/We weren't compatible./Take good care of it.]
 7419: Is that so? I guess this is hard on you too, then. Sorry...
 7420: Is that so? That's a good attitude to have...
 7421: ... I'm disappointed in you.
 7422: I don't think it's a matter of compatibility. A chocobo is not a toy!
 7423: We will. I'm sure you have your reasons, but it's still no excuse.
 7424: Of course not! Whew, you had me frightened for a second there! Don't say such things!
 7425: You really want to retire your chocobo?
 7426: Retire your chocobo? [Yes./Not yet!]
 7427: Once you retire your chocobo, you won't be able to meet it anytime you want anymore. Are you okay with that?
 7428: Understood. We hope you enjoyed raising your chocobo.
 7429: Of course not! Such a decision cannot be made in haste!
 7430: Your chocobo learns Gallop!
 7431: Your chocobo learns Canter!
 7432: Your chocobo learns Burrow!
 7433: Your chocobo learns Bore!
 7434: Your chocobo learns Auto-Regen!
 7435: Your chocobo learns Treasure Finder!
 7436: I'm afraid we still aren't finished using the $0, so I will have to return your item to you.
 7437: You give the $0 to the chocobo.
 7438: The chocobo looks like it's already full, but it's forcing itself to eat...
 7439: Your chocobo is sleeping soundly. You cannot feed it now.
 7440: Your chocobo has run away. You cannot feed it now.
 7441: You cannot feed a chocobo that has not hatched yet.
 7442: It seems like it will have some sort of effect on the chocobo...
 7443: Let me know if you have any questions about chocobo raising.
 7444: What would you like to ask about? [The Vana'diel Chocobo Society./Time required./Chocobo attributes./Care schedule./Caring for your chocobo./Feed./Abilities and personality./Retirement./Matchmaking./Calling chocobos in the field./Items./Lost chicks./Nothing.]
 7445: Just let me know if you ever get curious!
 7446: The Vana'diel Chocobo Society, or VCS for short, is an international organization designed to train and dispatch chocogirls and chocoguys to stables across Vana'diel.
 7447: They provide courses on practical chocobo riding and the proper ways to care for a chocobo, as well as working to improve the treatment of chocobos from here to Aht Urhgan.
 7448: Anyone can join as long as they love chocobos. The VCS will help you with anything you need.
 7449: Chicks hatch from eggs, grow into young chocobos, and finally mature.
 7450: They grow much faster than people do. Usually it takes about 1 month (Earth time) before you can ride your chocobo.
 7451: The chocobo's traits are determined by the way in which you care for your animal. Without proper planning, you won't be able to raise the type of chocobo that you want.
 7452: But don't worry, because you have us to help! We're all in this together!
 7453: Ask about which attribute? [Strength./Endurance./Discernment./Receptivity./Energy./Affection./Satisfaction./Nothing.]
 7454: "Strength" is a term used to describe the chocobo's leg power. The more strength a chocobo has, the faster it will be able to run. Rental chocobos have been raised with an emphasis on this attribute.
 7455: Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as "Physical attributes."
 7456: "Endurance" is a term used to describe the chocobo's stamina. If your chocobo has high endurance, you will be able to ride it for a long period of time.
 7457: Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as "Physical attributes."
 7458: "Discernment" is a must for anyone who wants their chocobo to learn new abilities. You may want to consider raising this attribute if you are interested in digging for treasure.
 7459: Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as "Mental attributes."
 7460: "Receptivity" is a term used to describe the chocobo's sensitivity when dealing with others. You can foster receptivity in your chocobo by giving it lots of opportunities to communicate with other chocobos.
 7461: Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as "Mental attributes."
 7462: "Energy" is a term used to describe the amount of power the chocobo needs to stay active for the day. If your chocobo has a lot of energy, care plans are more likely to be successful and you can provide more direct care for your chocobo.
 7463: You can restore your chocobo's energy by feeding it, so remember not to skip out on feeding time after a demanding schedule!
 7464: "Affection" is the most important attribute of all. Your care schedule will fall flat if you don't show your chocobo proper affection!
 7465: You can raise your chocobo's affection by feeding it greens and caring for it on a regular basis.
 7466: If you really want to raise your chocobo's affection quickly, you can give it $0, but I can't recommend doing so unless absolutely necessary.
 7467: "Satisfaction" is a term used to describe how full or hungry your chocobo is. If your chocobo is full, it will gain a lot of energy before the next day.
 7468: However, when the chocobo is very hungry, its energy will hardly recover at all and its affection will rapidly decrease.
 7469: What would you like to ask about? [What is a care schedule?/Basic care./Resting./Taking a walk./Listening to music./Exercising alone./Exercising in a group./Interacting with children./Interacting with chocobos./Carrying packages./Exhibiting to the public./Delivering messages./Digging for treasure./Acting in a play./Nothing.]
 7470: A care schedule is a series of plans that you set up for your chocobo so that we can take care of it while you are away.
 7471: How you want us to care for your chocobo each day is completely up to you.
 7472: You can register up to four plans at once, each for up to 7 days (Earth time).
 7473: When you come to check on your chocobo, we will give you a report on the results. You should listen closely to the report and use it as reference when deciding on a new schedule.
 7474: With the basic care plan, we will provide the minimum level of care for your chocobo. This plan is the most stable, and your chocobo will probably not experience any sudden changes.
 7475: The basic care plan is good for those who don't want their chocobo's traits to change much or are still unsure of what kind of schedule to choose.
 7476: You can select the basic care plan the moment you start raising your chocobo.
 7477: The rest plan's name speaks for itself. We will give your chocobo a rest in order to restore its energy and cure any status abnormalities.
 7478: However, your chocobo will not be able to eat any food you give it during the plan, because it will be in a deep sleep.
 7479: We can take your chocobo for a walk in town to improve its physical attributes of strength and endurance. However, it will have a negative effect on its mental attributes of discernment and receptivity.
 7480: Listening to music will improve your chocobo's mental attributes of discernment and receptivity. However, it will have a negative effect on its physical attributes of strength and endurance.
 7481: Exercising alone will significantly improve your chocobo's strength. On the other hand, its mental attributes will markedly decrease.
 7482: If the chocobo is strong, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo is weak, then you shouldn't push it too hard.
 7483: Exercising with chocobos will build your animal's endurance. On the other hand, its mental attributes will decrease.
 7484: If the chocobo has high endurance, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo's endurance is low, then you shouldn't push it too hard.
 7485: Interacting with children helps your chocobo become a more discerning creature by interacting with people.
 7486: However, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes, as no strenuous exercise is involved.
 7487: If the chocobo has good discernment, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good discernment, then you shouldn't push it too hard.
 7488: Interacting with other chocobos in the field will improve the chocobo's receptivity by fostering its communication skills.
 7489: But because the focus is on communication and not exercise, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes.
 7490: If the chocobo has good receptivity, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good receptivity, then you shouldn't push it too hard.
 7491: You can choose to have your chocobo help deliver packages. Not only will this improve its physical attributes, but you will even receive payment for your services!
 7492: The downside is that your chocobo's mental attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo, or you might find yourself getting cold treatment.
 7493: You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public, which will allow anyone visiting the chocobo stables to take a look at your animal. Being the center of attention will help improve your chocobo's mental attributes.
 7494: The downside is that your chocobo's physical attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo afterwards. Also, you will receive payment for this service.
 7495: You can choose to have your chocobo deliver official messages for the nation. Not only will this improve its strength, but you will even receive payment for your services!
 7496: However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.
 7497: You can have your chocobo help out VCS finances by digging for treasure. This will also improve the chocobo's discernment.
 7498: The VCS will sell the item and use the money for the organization's benefit, but will provide you with payment for your services.
 7499: However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.
 7500: You can choose to have your chocobo act as an extra in a play to improve its receptivity.
 7501: You will receive payment in accordance with the chocobo's performance. However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.
 7502: What would you like to ask about? [A general explanation./Watching over your chocobo./Telling a story./Scolding./Competing./Taking a walk./Nothing.]
 7503: In addition to setting the chocobo's schedule, you can also care directly for your chocobo whenever you like.
 7504: Caring for your chocobo will increase its affection for you.
 7505: On the other hand, a chocobo that receives too much care will lose energy more rapidly when engaging in activities. If you do nothing but care for your chocobo, it will become fatigued.
 7506: However, not caring enough for your chocobo will have a negative effect on your relationship, so it is important to find a balance.
 7507: You can watch over your chocobo whenever you like.
 7508: Your fond gaze can communicate even more than a touch and will not have a very tiring effect on the animal.
 7509: You can tell the chocobo a story you know. This will foster the animal's sensibilities.
 7510: I've heard that by listening to the story, the chocobo might even realize it has powers it never noticed before. (I've never seen it happen before, though...)
 7511: Sometimes your chocobo might start acting spoiled or refuse to do anything but sleep. In such times, you will need to firmly scold it.
 7512: This will shame the animal and have an effect on its receptivity.
 7513: Competing against other chocobos will cultivate your animal's ambitious spirit and is highly effective for bored chocobos.
 7514: You can take your chocobo out for a walk in the field. You will be able to choose more destinations as your chocobo grows.
 7515: I like to take the chocobo out often, too, but I'm sure it prefers going out with you.
 7516: Leaving the stables every once in a while allows your chocobo to experience new sights and sounds. Maybe you'll even discover something new together!
 7517: What would you like to know about? [Why feeding is important./Vegetables./Wildgrasses./Carrots./Worms./Medicines./Pastes./Nothing.]
 7518: Chocobos digest feed quickly, so they are often hungry.
 7519: However, they also restore energy at a rapid pace. If you do not feed your chocobo properly, it will be unable to restore enough energy.
 7520: The chocobo stables will provide your chocobo with the minimum amount of feed required for the animal to survive, but you need to provide more in order to ensure its healthy growth.
 7521: At the same time, feeding your chocobo too much can result in a stomachache. Remember to strike a balance with both the variety and quantity of feed you give to your animal!
 7522: Some types of feed have special effects, so it is important not to neglect your chocobo's diet if you want to raise a good chocobo.
 7523: There are different methods of acquiring these special types of feed, so be on the lookout for them!
 7524: Just trade the feed to an advanced chocobo trainer, and they will give it to your chocobo.
 7525: This is the standard variety of chocobo feed, among which $0 are most popular.
 7526: Chocobos also seem to enjoy $0 and $1.
 7527: These greens are the most effective in satisfying a chocobo's hunger. Chocobos also enjoy the taste, which raises affection for their owner.
 7528: Wildgrasses are a type of medicinal herb. They do not taste very good, but are highly effective at curing status abnormalities.
 7529: $0, for example, works well on wounds. So although they look similar to $1, the effects are different.
 7530: In addition, $0 is effective for illness, and $1 for a stomachache. It's a good idea to remember which herb to use in each situation.
 7531: Carrots are high in nutrition, and will have an effect on the chocobo's strength and discernment.
 7532: %, for example, affect the chocobo's physical attributes, and $1 are good for its mental attributes. $2 are in a category of their own.
 7533: Remember, though, that the results are very slight, and keeping a good care schedule is a far more efficient way to alter your chocobo's attributes.
 7534: Using worms as feed can have a variety of effects. They might look disgusting, but their effectiveness is not to be ignored!
 7535: For example, $0 will dramatically increase your chocobo's affection, and $1 will restore its energy.
 7536: But watch out for the side effects... Give the chocobo a worm at the wrong time, and all your effort could come to nothing...
 7537: The most curious of all the worms is the $0. At first it may not seem to have any effect, but looks are deceiving...
 7538: Medicines can cure a chocobo in the blink of an eye.
 7539: $0 will restore your chocobo's energy in full, making it easier to care for and ensuring that the care schedule goes smoothly.
 7540: % are effective for most status abnormalities, restoring instant health to your chocobo. Of course, you still need to continue caring for your chocobo so it can fully recover.
 7541: A potion can also help fill a chocobo's stomach, so they can be useful when you are short on feed.
 7542: Feed can be ground into paste for chicks to eat.
 7543: You can make paste yourself with some cooking skill. If you don't have enough cooking skill yourself, then you might want to ask a friend to make some for you.
 7544: Chicks can also eat regular feed, though.
 7545: Which would you like to ask about? [Abilities./Temperament./Weather preferences./Nothing.]
 7546: Your chocobo may learn useful abilities during the course of its life at the stables.
 7547: For example, Auto-Regen will increase the rate at which your chocobo restores energy. Such an ability is sure to come in handy in a variety of situations.
 7548: Your chocobo learns abilities by listening to your words, so if you know of any story that you think might interest the animal, you should tell it often.
 7549: But remember, your chocobo can't learn all of the abilities there are. It can only learn two...or at least, that's what I read.
 7550: The chocobo's temperament is determined when it is just a chick. Its temperament and attributes are somehow related, but I'm not really sure how.
 7551: Chocobos generally like sunny days, but they could grow to like other kinds of weather depending on how they are raised.
 7552: Chocobos pay attention to the air outside when they go on walks, and grow to prefer that type of weather because of the memories.
 7553: Make the animal's schedule around its preferred weather days, and plans are more likely to succeed. However, if the chocobo has a favored type of weather, it also dislikes certain conditions, creating a weak point to watch for.
 7554: You can choose to retire your chocobo at any time after it has fully matured.
 7555: After retirement, the VCS will take up caring for the chocobo where you left off, so you need not worry about its welfare.
 7556: When your chocobo retires, you will receive $0. Be sure not to lose it.
 7557: You can use the $0 to register your chocobo to call in the field or for matchmaking purposes after retirement. All you need to do is trade it to a VCS member.
 7558: The empty stall created after your animal retires can be used for raising other chocobos, so if you happen to come across another egg, you can bring it here to start all over again!
 7559: When your chocobo is mature enough, you can breed it with another chocobo. If the chocobo lays an egg, the chick will inherit the traits of its parents.
 7560: You will need $0 and $1 if you want to breed your chocobo. Apparently, you also need some kind of ticket that they sell at the stables in Upper Jeuno.
 7561: You can ask one of the VCS members to issue you a chococard, or if your chocobo is already retired, just trade them $0.
 7562: I don't really know that much about it, but you should probably try matching your chocobo up with several different animals and seeing what the results are.
 7563: When your chocobo is mature enough, you can call it in the field using $0.
 7564: You need to let a member of the VCS know which chocobo you want to respond to your call, because they must choose a saddle that fits your chocobo's attributes.
 7565: That also means that when your chocobo's attributes change or it learns a new ability, you should probably let the VCS member know, too.
 7566: When you want to register a retired chocobo to respond to your call in the field, trade $0 to a VCS member.
 7567: Also, the $0's power will grow weak after you've used it several times.
 7568: If this happens, just trade it to a VCS member and they will give you a new one for a fee.
 7569: What would you like to ask about? [%./Chococards./$1./Nothing.]
 7570: $0 proves that you are your chocobo's caretaker.
 7571: With this card, you can register a retired chocobo to respond to your call in the field or get a chococard for matchmaking.
 7572: If you lose it, you won't be able to get another one, so keep it in a safe place!
 7573: You can use $0 to call your chocobo in the field to use as a mount.
 7574: The more you use it, the weaker it will get, so eventually you will need to exchange it to a VCS member for a new one.
 7575: Only people who have been approved by the VCS President can get $0, so good luck with that...
 7576: Chococards are documents that contain all the details about a chocobo's attributes and condition. They are divided into two types--one for each gender.
 7577: If you trade one to the person who's in charge of matchmaking, he'll introduce your animal to another chocobo.
 7578: Chococards contain information on the chocobo's attributes and condition at the time the card is issued, so be sure to get a new card before using this service or the match will be arranged based on out-of-date information.
 7579: If you want a chococard for a retired chocobo, then you must trade $0 to a VCS member.

 7750: Lately, $0 has been making an awful fuss at night.
 7751: Chicks have a tendency to cry a lot, but I think this may be worse than normal...
 7752: <Player>, could you hold on to this $3 for a while?
 7753: Having something with your scent and warmth on it should comfort the chick.
 7754: That should be enough. Let me see the $3 now.
 7755: $0 should be able to sleep well with this.
 7756: Thanks to the $3, $0 has been sleeping soundly at night.
 7757: I have not seen you around lately, so I gave the chick something myself to help it sleep.
 7758: I will dispose of the $3 for you.
 7759: Your chocobo has finally grown large enough to ride? Magnificent news!
 7760: As you say, $0 is required to call the animal in the field, and as president of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society, it is my duty to distribute them. However...
 7761: $0 has finally grown large enough to ride!
 7762: $0 has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs!
 7763: $0 has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that fine beak!
 7764: $0 has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that graceful plumage!
 7765: $0 has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs and fine beak!
 7766: $0 has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs and fine plumage!
 7767: $0 has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that fine beak and graceful plumage!
 7768: $0 has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs, that fine beak...and what graceful plumage!
 7769: I must say, $0 has never looked better!
 7770: You will need $0 in order to call it in the field. It is my duty as president of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society to distribute them, but...
 7771: I gave this to $0 when it was but a chick.
 7772: I am afraid $0 seems to trust me more than you...
 7773: You gave me an egg quite recently. I cannot care for two at once.
 7774: I am afraid I cannot take your egg because you are already in the process of raising a chocobo.
 7775: I can't take your egg because you're raising a chocobo at another nation's stables.
 7776: You would like to tend to this egg?
 7777: We will provide it with the best of care, then... Let us make a fine chocobo out of this egg.
 7778: A chick has hatched from the egg!
 7779: Adorable, is it not? You may name it at a later time.
 7780: Sometimes people forget to name their chocobo, but this can cause a number of inconveniences when it comes time to fulfill certain procedures for the animal after it matures.
 7781: Just look at that color! It will not be long until $0 is fully grown!
 7782: And I must say, your bird seems quite energetic. Quite more than usual, in fact.
 7783: You have done a magnificent job raising this chocobo. Now is the best time to improve its attributes.
 7784: And I must say, $0 is beginning to develop quite a distinguished air.
 7785: $0's growth seems to have stabilized. The animal has developed quite a distinguished air.
 7786: And I must say, $0 seems quite satisfied. You have raised one fine animal.
 7787: But, <Player>... You still haven't named it.
 7788: Well then, I shall give the poor animal a name. From now on, your chocobo will be known as...
 7789: $0!
 7790: Your chocobo seems to like its new name.
 7791: I am terribly sorry, but it looks like the time has come to part with your chocobo. $0 will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society farms.
 7792: Do not fret; this will not be your last meeting.
 7793: $0 will come to you whenever you call.
 7794: $0 is injured, but I am sure it would heal quickly if we had $1.
 7795: $0's injury has completely healed.
 7796: $0 seems to be a bit under the weather. $1 should fix it right up, though.
 7797: $0's illness has completely healed.
 7798: $0 seems to have a stomachache. Are you giving it a proper diet?
 7799: $0 seems to have a stronger stomach these days.
 7800: $0 seems lonely. You should venture out together sometime.
 7801: $0 no longer seems lonely.
 7802: ...Oho, you are not afraid that it has stopped caring about you, are you?
 7803: I am not sure what to say to that!
 7804: $0 seems quite perky lately. It should be responsive to anything you give it now.
 7805: $0 seems to have had its fill and has calmed down.
 7806: $0 is sleeping soundly right now, so you should not disturb it.
 7807: $0 has been waking up every morning as of late.
 7808: $0 is very ill. We need $1 in order to help it.
 7809: $0's fever has gone down.
 7810: $0 seems bored and restless. You should have it compete against other chocobos sometime.
 7811: $0 seems to have more zest for life nowadays.
 7812: $0 has been behaving quite spoiled as of late. You should discipline it more often.
 7813: $0 has become more responsive to commands lately.
 7814: I am terribly sorry, but $0 has run away. Someone was supposed to be taking care of it...
 7815: I think it just wanted attention, though...
 7816: It should come back if we wait a while.
 7817: $0 is back, and I am pleased to say it seems to be fine.
 7818: I know you were worried, but you should give it a warm welcome. It must have missed you terribly.
 7819: $0 has been acting strange lately. Its head is in the clouds and it does not seem to have much of an appetite...
 7820: You should bring it to meet with other chocobos. I am sure that would give its spirits a lift.
 7821: It seems that $0 was in love, but it is feeling better now and its appetite has returned. Everything should be all right.
 7822: $0 is so full of energy today! Now's your chance to get in some rigorous physical training!
 7823: $0 has burned through that excess energy and calmed down a little.
 7824: $0 seems unusually bright and focused today! Now's your chance to get in some rigorous mental training!
 7825: $0 has burned through that excess mental energy and calmed down a little.
 7826: The time has come to name your chocobo! I wonder what kind of name you will choose...
 7827: Your chocobo seems to like its new name!
 7828: Now you can call your chocobo by its name when it returns.
 7829: Now you can call your chocobo by its name when it awakens.
 7830: Your chocobo should grow accustomed to its name in no time.
 7831: On your marks... Get set... Go!
 7832: And the winner is...$0!
 7833: And the winner is...$1!
 7834: I couldn't take care of $0 because it ran away...
 7835: We have been taking good care of your egg. I cannot wait to see how the chick will look.
 7836: We have been taking good care of $0. It has been passing its time here in the stables without concern.
 7837: $0 rested well. It appeared to be having pleasant dreams...
 7838: I took the chocobo on a walk around town. It seemed interested in everything!
 7839: I played some music for $0, and it loved the tune so much it started chirping along!
 7840: $0 has had quite a workout! I would say its speed has somewhat improved.
 7841: $0 exercised with the other chocobos here. All that stimulation seems to have made the animal a bit more patient.
 7842: $0 has been out playing with the children of San d'Oria. Even I felt like a kid again!
 7843: $0 has been out playing with the other chocobos here. They all seemed so cheerful, I started to think back to when I was a child...
 7844: ...$0? Oh...oh yes! $0 seemed to enjoy it too...
 7845: $0 has been out carrying packages. It seems the clients received their orders in a timely fashion...
 7846: But it seems that the chocobo was in so big of a hurry that it dropped some of the packages on the way.
 7847: $0 has been out carrying packages. In $2 out of $1 [day/days], the clients have properly received their orders.
 7848: Your pay has arrived from the guilds in the form of $1 gil. You have earned it.
 7849: We put $0 on exhibition. It enjoyed playing to the crowds...
 7850: However, it got a bit too carried away, and ended up making some children cry.
 7851: We put $0 on exhibition. In $2 out of $1 [day/days], it was extremely popular with the crowds.
 7852: Please accept $0 gil as a token of our gratitude.
 7853: $0 was sent to deliver official messages for San d'Oria.
 7854: Thanks to $0, San d'Oria was able to smoothly exchange information with the other nations of Vana'diel...
 7855: However, it got lost several times on the way.
 7856: In $2 out of $1 [day/days], your chocobo delivered messages without a problem.
 7857: As a measure of compensation, San d'Oria awards you with $0 gil. You have earned it.
 7858: Your chocobo has been digging up a storm. You would not believe what it has found!
 7859: $0 worked hard, but turned up with very few items in the end.
 7860: In $2 out of $1 [day/days], your chocobo has found items in the ground.
 7861: $0 recently appeared in a play. It was fantastic! It even threw in some improvisation and showed up all the other actors!
 7862: $0 recently appeared in a play, but did not seem to know its role and only caused trouble for the other actors...
 7863: $0 has been appearing in plays recently. In $2 out of $1 [day/days], the audience's reaction has been positive.
 7864: The playmaster offers $0 gil in exchange for your services. You should spend it wisely.
 7865: Hello, <Player>. I have some information to relay to you regarding your egg.
 7866: Hello, <Player>. I have some information to relay to you regarding $0.
 7867: That is all for now. What brings you here today?
 7868: Hello, <Player>. What brings you here today?
 7869: Hello, <Player>.
 7870: Let us analyze your egg's current condition...
 7871: Let us analyze $0's current condition...
 7872: I cannot tell yet whether the chocobo will be male or female.
 7873: It looks like your chocobo is...a $0[male/female]!
 7874: Strength: [Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]
 7875: Endurance: [Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]
 7876: Discernment: [Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]
 7877: Receptivity: [Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]
 7878: Regarding affection, it seems to [not care about you at all/be able to endure your company/slightly enjoy your company/like being around you/like you pretty well/like you a lot/want to be with you all the time/regard you as its parent].
 7879: Hmmm... Your chocobo seems to be [starving/quite hungry/a little hungry/neither hungry nor full/neither hungry nor full/almost full/quite full/completely full].
 7880: It looks like your chocobo's condition is stable. There have not been any changes worth mention.
 7881: Your chocobo's leg seems to be slightly wounded. $1 might help it heal.
 7882: Your chocobo seems to have a stomachache. $1 might help it feel better.
 7883: Your chocobo seems to be slightly ill. $1 might help it feel better.
 7884: Your chocobo is very ill. $1 might help it feel better.
 7885: Your chocobo is not receiving enough affection, and seems very depressed. You should pay more attention to your animal.
 7886: $0 has been receiving plenty of affection, and seems extremely happy. It is in excellent condition now!
 7887: $0 is sleeping soundly in order to heal its fatigue.
 7888: $0 seems bored and restless. You should give it something to do, like taking it out to race against other chocobos.
 7889: $0 is hopelessly spoiled! You should discipline it sometimes.
 7890: $0 ran away from the stables the moment I turned my back... It must have been upset about something. All we can do is wait for it to come back now.
 7891: $0 seems to have its head in the clouds lately... It must be in love.
 7892: Your chocobo has been making a real fuss at night lately. Such behavior is common for chicks, but you should deal with it as soon as possible.
 7893: $0 is so full of energy today!
 7894: $0 is unusually bright and focused today!
 7895: It [has a very easygoing personality/is rather ill-tempered/is a very patient chocobo/is quite sensitive/has a rather enigmatic personality], making it [easy to care for/ideal for military use/ideal for carrying goods/good with people/difficult to know what the animal is thinking].
 7896: Your chocobo [likes clear days/likes hot, sunny days/likes rainy days/likes sandstorms/likes windy days/likes snow/likes thunder/likes auroras/likes dark days/ /likes cloudy days.][./ and dislikes rainy days./ and dislikes thunder./ and dislikes windy days./ and dislikes snow./ and dislikes hot, sunny days./ and dislikes sandstorms./ and dislikes dark days./ and dislikes auroras.]
 7897: Last of all, your animal does not seem to know any abilities.
 7898: Last of all, your animal seems to have the ability "[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder]."
 7899: Last of all, your animal seems to have the abilities "[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder]" and "[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder]."
 7900: Chocobos are delicate creatures, and their condition easily changes. The secret to raising a good chocobo is giving it plenty of care.
 7901: Your egg does not seem to be in the best condition at the moment. It would probably be best to leave it alone for a while.
 7902: $0 needs more energy before you can provide it with proper care.
 7903: If you watch over $0, it will gradually return your affection.
 7904: Telling $0 a story will help it develop a healthy psychological state. Remember that concentrating on your speech will have a slightly tiring effect on your chocobo, though.
 7905: When $0 refuses to do anything but sleep or acts stubborn, you must discipline it. Remember that reproof is an act of love.
 7906: You are interested in entering your chocobo into competitions? Strange...there were three others who mentioned the same thing.
 7907: Well, it is good for their physical development, after all. I suppose it is acceptable as long as they do not fight.
 7908: You can take your chocobo on a walk just outside of town. Because West Ronfaure is nearby, $0 shouldn't grow very tired.
 7909: You can take your chocobo on a walk a ways from town. The La Theine Plateau is not too far, so $0 should not grow exhausted.
 7910: You can take your chocobo on a walk as far out as the Jugner Forest. Being together such a long time should do wonders for the bond between you and $0.
 7911: This is the basic care plan for your chocobo. Under this plan, we will provide for your chocobo's most fundamental needs.
 7912: You can choose to give your chocobo a long rest. This will revitalize its energy and accelerate its recovery from injury or illness.
 7913: If you like, we can take your chocobo out on a walk through the safe areas of town. This should improve its physical condition.
 7914: Listening to music will make your chocobo a more refined creature, and should improve its mental condition.
 7915: Exercising alone will improve your chocobo's strength, but will have a slightly negative effect on its mental condition.
 7916: Exercising in a group will improve your chocobo's stamina, but will have a slightly negative effect on its mental condition.
 7917: Playing with children will improve your chocobo's intelligence, but will have a slightly negative effect on its physical condition.
 7918: Playing with other chocobos will improve your chocobo's receptivity, but will have a slightly negative effect on its physical condition.
 7919: You can earn some money by having your chocobo deliver packages for a transport agency.
 7920: Carrying heavy loads will improve its physical condition, but will inflict a certain amount of stress on the animal.
 7921: You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public. We will provide you with a monetary token of gratitude for this service.
 7922: Interacting with the public will improve its mental condition, but will inflict a certain amount of stress on the animal.
 7923: You can send your chocobo to deliver official messages for San d'Oria, which will compensate you for your services.
 7924: Carrying someone on its back for a long period of time will build strength in your chocobo's legs, but will place some strain on the animal.
 7925: You can send your chocobo to dig for items to benefit the stables. We will thank you for your contribution with a certain amount of gil.
 7926: Digging for items will improve your chocobo's intelligence, but will place some strain on the animal.
 7927: Your chocobo can even appear in plays. You will receive payment for this service in gil.
 7928: Interacting with actors and the audience should improve the chocobo's receptivity, but the difficult practice will place some strain on the animal.
 7929: What is this? You want to give up on this egg, do you?
 7930: What is this? Are you telling me that you no longer want to raise this chocobo?
 7931: You would not want to stop raising the poor animal at a time like this, would you?
 7932: Give up? [Yes, I can't do it anymore./No, I want to continue.]
 7933: You just started raising the poor creature! You are absolutely sure you want to do this?
 7934: Fine. Then you will never see your chocobo again. Is that all right with you?
 7935: If you decide to stop raising $0, you will never see it again. Are you really willing to give up without even seeing its face one last time?
 7936: Give up raising your chocobo? [Yes./No!]
 7937: Fine. Then the stables shall raise this egg. Do you have anything to say for yourself?
 7938: Fine. Custody of this chocobo will be transferred to the stables. Is there anything you wish to say before you are parted?
 7939: Fine. When $0 returns, the stables will begin caring for it. Do you have anything you wish to say?
 7940: What would you like to say? [Nothing./I'm sorry./It's just an animal!/We weren't compatible./Take good care of it.]
 7941: Is that so? I guess this is hard on you too, then. I apologize...
 7942: Is that so? That is a proper attitude...
 7943: ... I am disappointed in you.
 7944: You have not even seen its face yet, have you? Once you decide to raise an animal, you should see it through to the end.
 7945: No matter how incompatible you feel you may be, once you decide to raise an animal, you should see it through to the end.
 7946: We will. I am sure you have your reasons, but it still becomes no excuse.
 7947: I see. May you always continue to care for your chocobo!
 7948: You cannot retire a chocobo that has not been named.
 7949: Are you sure you want to retire $0?
 7950: Retire $0? [Yes./Not yet!]
 7951: Once you retire $0, you will become unable to meet it whenever you want. You have no qualms with this?
 7952: Really retire your chocobo? [Yes, really!/No, I've changed my mind!]
 7953: Understood. Then the chocobo will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's stables. Now is the time to say your goodbyes.
 7954: Understood. It will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's farms as soon as it returns.
 7955: Parting with your chocobo is difficult, is it not? But have no fear...you can see it again. Keep your chin up.
 7956: I'm sure it must be difficult not being able to say goodbye to $0. Don't worry, though...you can see it again. Don't look so down.
 7957: I cannot issue any documents to a chocobo that has not been named.
 7958: A chococard contains all the vital information about the chocobo that you are raising.
 7959: Trade a chococard to the matchmaker in Jeuno, and you will be able to breed your animal with another chocobo. I can issue a chococard for $0 gil.
 7960: You can register a chocobo to respond to your call in the field. The chocobo will come to you when you use your $0.
 7961: Your chocobo's registered data determines certain features, such as its saddle, so it is wise to re-register from time to time.
 7962: You can register a retired chocobo by trading $0 to me.
 7963: All right, then. I shall prepare $0.
 7964: All right, then. I'll get $0 ready as soon as it returns.
 7965: I will now register $0 to come when you call.
 7966: The preparations will cost $0 gil.
 7967: I have your $0 right here. You may take it now.
 7968: You lost your $0?
 7969: I can give you a new one, but it will cost you $1 gil.
 7970: This item links you and $0 together. You would be wise not to lose it again.
 7971: It seems you are taking fine care of this. There seems to be no problem.
 7972: This $2's power to call your chocobo seems to have grown weak.
 7973: I can give you a new $2 in exchange for it if you wish.
 7974: Here you go. Take good care of it.
 7975: All right... You can have this back, then.
 7976: Let me give you a new $2 in exchange for this old one.
 7977: And do not worry about the usual fee. The $0 is all I need from you this time.
 7978: I still have not given your chocobo its food, so I will return it to you.
 7979: Your chocobo is sleeping soundly. Please wait until it awakens before feeding it.
 7980: Your chocobo has run away. Please wait until it returns and then feed it.
 7981: Your chocobo has not hatched, so you cannot feed it yet.
 7982: Alright. Let's give $0 its food.
 7983: I hope it gets well soon.
 7984: I hope we can make this animal into a fine chocobo.
 7985: I hope your chocobo awakens soon.
 7986: Ah, <Player>. I have been waiting for you. You can have this.
 7987: To enter your current chocobo in one of the CRA-sanctioned races, you will require $0.
 7988: You need only trade it to a CRA agent to complete the registration process.
 7989: Good day, <Player>... What is this all about?
 7990: I see... So it was wandering around lost, was it? Poor thing.
 7991: <Player>, might I ask you a favor? Do you think you could search for this chick's owner? We will take care of it here at the stables until you find who it belongs to.
 7992: Its owner must be searching for the chick as well. You should probably check the areas where people take their chocobos on walks, first.
 7993: If you discover any relevant information, have Arvilauge take down the details for you.
 7994: <Player>, have you had any luck locating the chick's owner? I have been collecting information on my own time, as well...
 7995: The owner's name begins with the letter [C/L/V].
 7996: The owner is [an Elvaan man/an Elvaan woman/an old Elvaan man/an old Elvaan woman].
 7997: The owner is [a town information guide/a watchman/someone who delivers parcels/a merchant].
 7998: I will do my own searching when I have the time. I hope we manage to find something.
 7999: I have gathered new information on the lost chick's owner.
 8000: That is all I could find. I will leave the rest in your capable hands.
 8001: The chick's owner came and picked it up a moment ago. I am glad that we found its rightful home.
 8002: I found the chick's owner and returned it to its home.
 8003: I am terribly sorry, but that choice violates the VCS naming conventions. Might I trouble you to choose another combination?
 8004: Lately, $0 has been crying loud enough at night to wake the dead.
 8005: Chicks tend to cry a lot, but I think this is worse than normal...
 8006: I've got an idea. Could you hold on to this $3 for a while?
 8007: Having something with your scent and warmth on it should comfort the chick.
 8008: I think that should be enough. Let me see the $3 now.
 8009: $0 should be able to sleep well with this.
 8010: Thanks to the $3, $0 has been sleeping like a baby.
 8011: I haven't seen you around lately, so I gave the chick something myself to help it sleep better.
 8012: I'll get rid of the $3 for you.
 8013: $0 has finally grown large enough to ride!
 8014: $0 has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs!
 8015: $0 has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that fine beak!
 8016: $0 has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that graceful plumage!
 8017: $0 has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs and fine beak!
 8018: $0 has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs and fine plumage!
 8019: $0 has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that fine beak and graceful plumage!
 8020: $0 has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs, that fine beak...and what graceful plumage!
 8021: $0 is becoming one fine bird, if you ask me!
 8022: You'll need $0 in order to call it in the field. You can get one at the chocobo stables in San d'Oria.
 8023: You just gave me an egg! I can't take care of two at once.
 8024: I can't take your egg because you're already raising a chocobo.
 8025: I can't take your egg because you're raising a chocobo at another nation's stables.
 8026: So you'd like to tend to this egg, eh?
 8027: We'll take good care of it, then... Let's make a fine chocobo out of this one.
 8028: A chick has hatched from the egg!
 8029: Isn't it cute? You can name it later.
 8030: Sometimes people forget to name their chocobo, but this can cause a hassle when the chocobo matures and it comes time to fill out important paperwork.
 8031: Just look at that color! It won't be long until $0 is fully grown!
 8032: And boy does it have a lot of energy! Maybe a little too much, I'd say!
 8033: You've done a great job raising this chocobo. Now is the best time to improve its attributes.
 8034: And I must say, $0 is beginning to develop quite a distinguished air. You're a natural at this!
 8035: $0's growth seems to have stabilized. The animal has developed quite a distinguished air.
 8036: And I must say, $0 seems quite satisfied. You've raised one fine animal!
 8037: But, <Player>... You still haven't named it.
 8038: I guess it's up to me to give the poor animal a name, then. From now on, your chocobo will be known as...
 8039: $0!
 8040: Your chocobo seems to like its new name.
 8041: I'm sorry, but it looks like the time has come to part with $0. Your chocobo will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's farms.
 8042: But don't worry; this won't be your last meeting.
 8043: $0 will come to you whenever you call.
 8044: $0 is injured, but I'm sure it would heal quickly if we had $1.
 8045: $0's injury has completely healed.
 8046: $0 seems to be a bit under the weather. $1 should fix it right up, though.
 8047: $0's illness has completely healed.
 8048: $0 seems to have a stomachache. You should probably feed it better.
 8049: $0 seems to have a stronger stomach these days.
 8050: $0 seems lonely. You should go out with it sometime.
 8051: $0 doesn't seem lonely anymore.
 8052: Afraid it's stopped caring about you, eh?
 8053: ...I've got no comment on that.
 8054: $0 seems pretty perky lately. It should be responsive to anything you give it now.
 8055: $0 seems to have had its fill and has calmed down.
 8056: $0 is sleeping soundly right now, so don't disturb it.
 8057: $0's been waking up every morning as of late.
 8058: $0 is very ill. We need $1 in order to help it.
 8059: $0's fever has gone down.
 8060: $0 seems bored and restless. You should have it compete against other chocobos sometime.
 8061: $0 seems to have more zest for life nowadays.
 8062: $0 is spoiled rotten! You should discipline it more often.
 8063: $0 has become more responsive to commands lately.
 8064: I'm really sorry, but $0 has run away. Someone was supposed to be taking care of it...
 8065: I think it just wants attention, though...
 8066: It should come back if we wait a while.
 8067: $0 is back, and I'm happy to say it seems to be fine.
 8068: I know it had you worried sick, but you should give it a warm welcome. It must've missed you terribly.
 8069: $0 has been acting strange lately. Its head is in the clouds and it will hardly eat anything...
 8070: You should bring it to meet with other chocobos. I'm sure that would give its spirits a lift.
 8071: It seems that $0 was in love. Everything should be all right now... Its appetite has returned and it appears to be feeling better.
 8072: $0 is so full of energy today! Now's your chance to get in some rigorous physical training!
 8073: $0 has burned through that excess energy and calmed down a little.
 8074: $0 seems unusually bright and focused today! Now's your chance to get in some rigorous mental training!
 8075: $0 has burned through that excess mental energy and calmed down a little.
 8076: The time has come to name your chocobo! Have any great ideas?
 8077: Your chocobo seems to like its new name!
 8078: Now you can call your chocobo by its name when it returns.
 8079: Now you can call your chocobo by its name when it wakes up.
 8080: I am sure your chocobo will get used to its new name in no time.
 8081: On your marks... Get set... Go!
 8082: And the winner is...$0!
 8083: And the winner is...$1!
 8084: I couldn't take care of $0 because it ran away...
 8085: We've been taking good care of your egg. I can't wait to see how the chick looks.
 8086: We've been taking good care of $0. It's been passing its time here in the stables without concern.
 8087: $0 rested well. It looked like it was having good dreams...
 8088: I took $0 on a walk around town. It seemed interested in everything!
 8089: I played some music for $0, and it loved the tune so much, it started chirping along!
 8090: $0's had quite a workout! I'd say its speed has even improved a bit.
 8091: I had your chocobo exercise with the other chocobos here. All that stimulation seems to have made the animal a bit more patient.
 8092: $0's been out playing with the children of Bastok. Even I felt like a kid again!
 8093: Your chocobo's been out playing with the other chocobos here. They all seemed so cheerful, I started to think back to when I was a kid...
 8094: Eh? Oh yeah, $0 seemed to enjoy it too...
 8095: $0 has been out carrying packages. It seems the clients received their orders in a timely fashion...
 8096: But it seems that the chocobo was in so big of a hurry that it dropped some of the packages on the way.
 8097: $0 has been out carrying packages. In $2 out of $1 [day/days], the clients have properly received their orders.
 8098: Your pay has arrived from the guilds in the form of $1 gil. Take it...you've earned it.
 8099: We put your chocobo on exhibition. $0 really played to the crowds...
 8100: But it was a little too aggressive, and ended up making some children cry.
 8101: We put $0 on exhibition. In $2 out of $1 [day/days], your chocobo was extremely popular with the crowds.
 8102: Please accept $0 gil as a token of our gratitude.
 8103: $0 was sent to deliver official messages for Bastok.
 8104: Thanks to $0, Bastok was able to smoothly exchange information with the other nations of Vana'diel...
 8105: However, it got lost several times on the way.
 8106: In $2 out of $1 [day/days], your chocobo delivered messages without a problem.
 8107: As a measure of compensation, Bastok awards you with $0 gil. You've earned it.
 8108: Your chocobo has been digging up a storm. You wouldn't believe what it's found!
 8109: $0 worked hard, but didn't turn up with many items in the end.
 8110: In $2 out of $1 [day/days], your chocobo found items in the ground.
 8111: $0 recently appeared in a play. It was fantastic! It even threw in some improvisation and showed up all the other actors!
 8112: $0 recently appeared in a play, but it didn't seem to know its role and only caused trouble for the other actors...
 8113: $0 has been appearing in plays recently. In $2 out of $1 [day/days], the audience's reaction has been positive.
 8114: The playmaster offers $0 gil in exchange for your services. Don't spend it all in one place.
 8115: There you are, <Player>. I've got something I want to tell you about your egg.
 8116: There you are, <Player>. I've got something I want to tell you about $0.
 8117: That's about it for now. What are you here for today?
 8118: Hello, <Player>. What are you here for today?
 8119: Hello, <Player>.
 8120: Let's see how your egg is doing today...
 8121: Let's see how $0 is doing today...
 8122: I still can't tell whether the chocobo will be male or female...
 8123: Your chocobo seems to be a $0[male/female]!
 8124: Strength: [Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]
 8125: Endurance: [Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]

 8127: Receptivity: [Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]
 8128: Regarding affection, it seems to [not care about you at all/be able to endure your company/slightly enjoy your company/like being around you/like you pretty well/like you a lot/want to be with you all the time/regard you as its parent].
 8129: Hmmm... Your chocobo seems to be [starving/quite hungry/a little hungry/neither hungry nor full/neither hungry nor full/almost full/quite full/completely full].
 8130: It looks like your chocobo's condition is stable. There have not been any changes worth mention.
 8131: Your chocobo's leg seems to be slightly wounded. $1 might help it heal.
 8132: Your chocobo seems to have a stomachache. $1 might help it feel better.
 8133: Your chocobo seems to be slightly ill. $1 might help it feel better.
 8134: Your chocobo is very ill. $1 might help it feel better.
 8135: Your chocobo is not receiving enough affection, and seems very depressed. You should pay more attention to your animal.
 8136: $0 has been receiving plenty of affection, and seems extremely happy. Your chocobo is in excellent condition now!
 8137: $0 is sleeping soundly in order to heal its fatigue. You should not disturb it now.
 8138: $0 seems bored and restless. You should give it something to do, like taking it out to race against other chocobos.
 8139: $0 is hopelessly spoiled! You should discipline it sometimes, too.
 8140: $0 ran away from the stables the moment I turned my back... It must have been upset about something. All we can do is wait for it to come back now.
 8141: $0 seems to have its head in the clouds lately... It must be in love with another chocobo.
 8142: Your chocobo has been making a real fuss at night lately. Such behavior is common for chicks, but you should deal with it as soon as possible.
 8143: $0 is so full of energy today!
 8144: $0 is unusually bright and focused today!
 8145: It [has a very easygoing personality/is rather ill-tempered/is a very patient chocobo/is quite sensitive/has a rather enigmatic personality], making it [easy to care for/ideal for military use/ideal for carrying goods/good with people/difficult to know what the animal is thinking].
 8146: Your chocobo [likes clear days/likes hot, sunny days/likes rainy days/likes sandstorms/likes windy days/likes snow/likes thunder/likes auroras/likes dark days/ /likes cloudy days.][./ and dislikes rainy days./ and dislikes thunder./ and dislikes windy days./ and dislikes snow./ and dislikes hot, sunny days./ and dislikes sandstorms./ and dislikes dark days./ and dislikes auroras.]

 8149: Last of all, your animal seems to have learned the abilities "[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder]" and "[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder]."
 8150: Chocobos are delicate creatures, and their condition easily changes. The secret to raising a good chocobo is giving it plenty of care.
 8151: Your egg doesn't seem to be doing well at the moment. It would probably be best to leave it alone for a while.
 8152: $0 needs more energy before you can take care of it.
 8153: If you watch over $0, it will gradually return your affection.
 8154: Telling your chocobo a story will help it develop a healthy psychological state. Remember that concentrating on your speech will have a slightly tiring effect on $0, though.
 8155: When $0 refuses to do anything but sleep or acts stubborn, you must discipline it. Remember that reproof is an act of love.
 8156: You're interested in entering your chocobo into competitions? Funny...there were three others who mentioned the same thing.
 8157: Well, it is good for their physical development, after all. I suppose it's alright as long as they don't fight.
 8158: You can take your chocobo on a walk just outside of town. Because North Gustaberg is nearby, $0 shouldn't grow very tired.
 8159: You can take your chocobo on a walk a ways from town. The Konschtat Highlands are not too far, so $0 shouldn't grow exhausted.
 8160: You can take your chocobo on a walk as far out as the Pashhow Marshlands. Being together so long should do wonders for the bond between you and $0.
 8161: This is the basic care plan for your chocobo. Under this plan, we will provide for your chocobo's most fundamental needs.
 8162: You can choose to give your chocobo a long rest. This will revitalize its energy and accelerate its recovery from injury or illness.
 8163: If you like, we can take your chocobo out on a walk through the safe areas of town. This should improve its physical condition.
 8164: Listening to music will make your chocobo a more refined creature, and should improve its mental condition.
 8165: Exercising alone will improve your chocobo's strength, but will have a slightly negative effect on its mental condition.
 8166: Exercising in a group will improve your chocobo's stamina, but will have a slightly negative effect on its mental condition.
 8167: Playing with children will improve your chocobo's intelligence, but will have a slightly negative effect on its physical condition.
 8168: Playing with other chocobos will improve your chocobo's receptivity, but will have a slightly negative effect on its physical condition.
 8169: You can earn some money by having your chocobo deliver packages for a transport agency.
 8170: Carrying heavy loads will improve its physical condition, but will inflict a certain amount of stress on the animal.
 8171: You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public. We will provide you with a monetary token of gratitude for this service.
 8172: Interacting with the public will improve its mental condition, but will inflict a certain amount of stress on the animal.
 8173: You can send your chocobo to deliver official messages for Bastok, which will compensate you for your services.
 8174: Carrying someone on its back for a long period of time will build strength in your chocobo's legs, but will place some strain on the animal.

 8176: Digging for items will improve your chocobo's intelligence, but will place some strain on the animal.
 8177: Your chocobo can even appear in plays. You will receive payment for this service in gil.
 8178: Interacting with actors and the audience should improve the chocobo's receptivity, but the difficult practice will place some strain on the animal.
 8179: What's that? You want to give up on this egg, do you?
 8180: What's that? You don't want to raise $0 any longer?
 8181: Eh? You want to stop raising the poor animal at a time like this?
 8182: You just started raising the poor creature! You're really sure you want to do this?
 8183: If you decide to quit, you will never see $0 again. Is that okay with you?
 8184: If you decide to quit, you will never see $0 again. Are you really willing to give up without even seeing its face one last time?
 8185: Fine. Then the stables will raise this egg. Is there anything you wish to say?
 8186: Fine. Custody of this chocobo will be transferred to the stables. Do you have any last words for $0?
 8187: Fine. When $0 returns, the stables will begin caring for it. Do you have anything you wish to say?
 8188: Is that so? I guess this is hard on you too, then. Sorry...
 8189: Is that so? That's a good attitude to have...
 8190: ... I'm disappointed in you.
 8191: Some excuse... You haven't even seen its face yet, have you? Once you decide to raise an animal, you should see it through to the end.
 8192: No matter how incompatible you feel you may be, once you decide to raise an animal, you should see it through to the end.
 8193: We will. I'm sure you have your reasons, but it's still no excuse.
 8194: Of course not! Keep up the good work with your chocobo, all right?
 8195: You cannot retire a chocobo that has not been named.
 8196: You really want to retire $0?
 8197: Once you retire your chocobo, you won't be able to see it anytime you want anymore. Are you okay with that?
 8198: Understood. $0 will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's farms.
 8199: Understood. $0 will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's farms as soon as it returns.
 8200: Parting with your chocobo is difficult, isn't it? Don't worry, though...you can see it again. Don't look so down.
 8201: I'm sure it must be difficult not being able to say goodbye to your chocobo. Don't worry, though...you can see $0 again. Don't look so down.
 8202: I cannot issue any documents to a chocobo that has not been named.
 8203: A chococard contains all the vital information about the chocobo that you are raising.
 8204: Trade a chococard to the matchmaker in Jeuno, and you will be able to breed your animal with another chocobo. I can issue a chococard for $0 gil.
 8205: You can register a chocobo to respond to your call in the field. The chocobo will come to you when you use your $0.
 8206: Your chocobo's registered data determines certain features, such as its saddle, so it is wise to re-register from time to time.
 8207: You can register a retired chocobo by trading $0 to me.
 8208: All right, then. I'll get $0 ready.
 8209: All right, then. I'll get $0 ready as soon as it returns.
 8210: I will now register $0 to come when you call.
 8211: I'll take $0 gil for the preparations.
 8212: I've got your $0 right here. You can have it now.
 8213: You lost your $0?
 8214: Well, I guess I'll have to get another one from Hantileon. It's going to cost you $1 gil, though.
 8215: This item links you and $0 together. You would be wise not to lose it again.
 8216: It looks like you're taking good care of this. There seems to be no problem.
 8217: This $2's power to call your chocobo seems to have grown weak.
 8218: I can give you a new $2 in exchange for it if you wish.
 8219: Here you go. Take good care of it.
 8220: All right... You can have this back, then.
 8221: Let me give you a new $2 in exchange for this old one.
 8222: And don't worry about the usual fee. The $0 is all I need from you this time.
 8223: I still haven't given your chocobo it's food, so I will return it to you.
 8224: Your chocobo is sleeping soundly. Please wait until it awakens before feeding it.
 8225: Your chocobo has run away. Please wait until it returns and then feed it.
 8226: Your chocobo has not hatched, so you cannot feed it yet.
 8227: Alright. Let's give $0 its food.
 8228: I hope it gets well soon.
 8229: I hope we can make this animal into a fine chocobo.
 8230: I hope your chocobo awakens soon.
 8231: Ah, <Player>. I've been waiting for you. You can have this.
 8232: To enter your current chocobo in one of the CRA-sanctioned races, you will require $0.
 8233: You need only trade it to a CRA agent to complete the registration process.
 8234: Hello, <Player>... What's all this about?
 8235: I see... So it was wandering around lost, was it? Poor thing.
 8236: <Player>, do you think you could search for its owner? We'll take care of it here at the stables until you find who it belongs to.
 8237: I'm sure its owner is searching for the chick as well. You should probably check the areas where people take their chocobos on walks, first.
 8238: If you discover anything, have Gonija take down the details.
 8239: <Player>, have you had any luck locating the chick's owner? I've been collecting information myself, too...
 8240: The owner's name starts with the letter [ / / /D/G/A].
 8241: The owner is [ / / / /a Galka/a Hume woman/a Hume man/an old Hume woman].
 8242: The owner is [ /a watchman/ /a merchant/a miner/a guild worker].
 8243: I'll search too when I have the time. I hope we manage to find something.
 8244: I've found more information on the lost chick's owner.
 8245: That's all I could find. The rest is up to you.
 8246: The chick's owner came and picked it up not long ago. I'm glad we found its rightful home.
 8247: I found the chick's owner and returned it to its home.
 8248: Hmm... I believe that name violates the VCS naming conventions. You'll need to choose something different, I'm afraid.
 8249: Lately, $0 has been crying loud enough at night to wake the dead!
 8250: I know chicks cry a lot, but this is the worst...
 8251: I know! Could you hold on to this $3 for a while?
 8252: Having something with your scent and warmth on it should comfort the chick.
 8253: That should be enough! Hand over the $3 now.
 8254: Hm...yes...$0 should be able to sleep well with this...
 8255: Thanks to the $3, $0 has been sleeping like a baby!
 8256: I haven't seen you around lately, so I gave the chick something myself to help it sleep better.
 8257: I'll get rid of this $3 for you. No need to thank me! I'm just that kind of gal!
 8258: $0 has finally grown large enough to ride!
 8259: $0 has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs!
 8260: $0 has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that fine beak!
 8261: $0 has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that graceful plumage!
 8262: $0 has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs and fine beak!
 8263: $0 has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs and fine plumage!
 8264: $0 has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that fine beak and graceful plumage!
 8265: $0 has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs, that fine beak...and what graceful plumage!
 8266: I must say, $0 has never looked better!
 8267: You'll need $0 in order to call it in the field. Sorry, but you have to go aaall the way to the chocobo stables in San d'Oria to get one!
 8268: You just gave me an egg! I can't take care of two at once!
 8269: I can't take that egg! You're already raising a chocobo!
 8270: I can't take your egg because you're raising a chocobo at another nation's stables!
 8271: So this is the egg you want to raise, is it?
 8272: We'll take good care of it, then... This is going to be the greatest chocobo ever!
 8273: A chick has hatched from the egg!
 8274: It's sooo cute! Let's name it later, okay?
 8275: Sometimes people forget to name their chocobo, but this can cause problems when the chocobo matures and it comes time to fill out important paperwork!
 8276: Just look at that color! It won't be long until $0 is fully grown!
 8277: And I must say, your bird seems quite energetic. Quite more than usual, in fact.
 8278: You did a really super job raising this chocobo! Now is the best time to improve its attributes.
 8279: And I must say, $0 is beginning to develop a pretty distinguished air.
 8280: $0's growth seems to have stabilized. The animal looks really distinguished now!
 8281: And I must say, $0 seems quite satisfied. You've raised one fine animal.
 8282: But, <Player>... You still haven't named it.
 8283: I guess it's up to me to give the poor animal a name, then! From now on, your chocobo will be known as...
 8284: $0!
 8285: Your chocobo seems to like its new name.
 8286: I'm sorry, but the time has come to part with $0! It will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society farms.
 8287: Come on, cheer up! This won't be your last meeting!
 8288: $0 will come to you whenever you call!
 8289: $0 is injured, but I'm sure it would heal quickly if we had $1.
 8290: $0's injury has completely healed!
 8291: $0 seems to be a bit under the weather. $1 should fix it right up, though.
 8292: $0's illness has completely healed!
 8293: $0 seems to have a stomachache. Are you giving it a proper diet?
 8294: $0 seems to have a stronger stomach these days!
 8295: $0 seems lonely. You should go out with it sometime.
 8296: $0 doesn't seem lonely anymore.
 8297: Afraid it's stopped caring about you now?
 8298: Hey, don't look at me for an answer... I don't speak Chocobo, you know!
 8299: $0 seems pretty perky lately! It should be responsive to anything you give it now.
 8300: $0 seems to have had its fill and has calmed down.
 8301: $0 is sleeping soundly right now, so don't disturb it.
 8302: Wow...$0 has been waking up every morning lately!
 8303: $0 is very ill. We need $1 to help it.
 8304: $0's fever has gone down.
 8305: $0 seems really bored! You should have it compete against other chocobos sometime.
 8306: $0 seems happier lately!
 8307: $0 is spoiled rotten! You should discipline it more often!
 8308: $0 has become more responsive to commands lately.
 8309: I'm so sorry, but $0 ran away! Someone was supposed to be taking care of it...
 8310: I think it just wants attention, though...
 8311: It should come back if we wait a while.
 8312: $0 is back, and it seems okay!
 8313: I know you were just beside yourself with worry, but you should welcome your chocobo with open arms. It must've missed you a lot!
 8314: $0 has been acting weird lately. Its head is in the clouds and will hardly eat anything...
 8315: You should bring it to meet with other chocobos. That should cheer it up!
 8316: It seems your chocobo was in love! Now it seems cheerful again and is eating like there's no tomorrow, so I guess things are back to normal!
 8317: $0 is so full of energy today! Now's your chance to get in some rigorous physical training!
 8318: $0 has burned through that excess energy and calmed down a little.
 8319: $0 seems unusually bright and focused today! Now's your chance to get in some rigorous mental training!
 8320: $0 has burned through that excess mental energy and calmed down a little.
 8321: The time has come to name your chocobo! What'll it be?
 8322: Oh! Your chocobo likes its new name!
 8323: Now you can call your chocobo by its name when it returns!
 8324: Now you can call your chocobo by its name when it wakes up!
 8325: I'm sure your chocobo will get used to its new name in no time!
 8326: On your marks... Get set... Go!
 8327: And the winner is...$0!
 8328: And the winner is...$1!
 8329: I couldn't take care of $0 because it ran away...
 8330: We've been taking good care of your egg. I can't wait to see how cute the chick will be!
 8331: We've been taking good care of $0. Your chocobo has been passing its time here in the stables without a concern in the world!
 8332: $0 rested well. It looked like it was having good dreams...
 8333: I took $0 on a walk around town. It seemed interested in everything!
 8334: I played some music for $0, and it loved the tune so much it started chirping along!
 8335: $0 has had quite a workout! I'd say its speed has even improved a bit.
 8336: I had your chocobo exercise with the other chocobos here. All that stimulation seems to have made it a bit more patient!
 8337: $0 has been out playing with the children of Windurst. Even I felt like a kid again!
 8338: Your chocobo's been out playing with the other chocobos here. They all seemed so cheerful, I started to think back to when I was a kid...
 8339: Oh...oh! Yes, of course, $0 enjoyed it too...
 8340: $0 has been out carrying packages. It seems the clients received their orders in a timely fashion...
 8341: But it seems that the chocobo was in so big of a hurry that it dropped some of the packages on the way.
 8342: $0 has been out carrying packages. In $2 out of $1 [day/days], the clients have properly received their orders.
 8343: Your pay has arrived from the guilds in the form of $1 gil. Take it...you've earned it!
 8344: We put $0 on exhibition. Your chocobo really played to the crowds!
 8345: But it was a little too much sometimes, and ended up making some children cry.
 8346: We put $0 on exhibition. In $2 out of $1 [day/days], it was extremely popular with the crowds.
 8347: Please accept $0 gil as a token of our gratitude!
 8348: $0 was sent to deliver official messages for Windurst.
 8349: Thanks to $0, Windurst was able to smoothly exchange information with the other nations of Vana'diel...
 8350: But it got lost sooo many times!
 8351: In $2 out of $1 [day/days], your chocobo delivered messages without a problem.
 8352: Windurst compensates you with $0 gil. You've earned it!
 8353: Your chocobo has been digging up a storm. You wouldn't believe what it's found!
 8354: $0 dug for hours, but it hardly found anything!
 8355: In $2 out of $1 [day/days], your chocobo has found items in the ground.
 8356: $0 recently appeared in a play. It was great! It even threw in some improvisation and showed up all the other actors!
 8357: $0 recently appeared in a play, but it didn't even know its role! It just caused trouble for the other actors.
 8358: $0 has been appearing in plays recently. In $2 out of $1 [day/days], the audience's reaction has been positive.
 8359: The playmaster offers $0 gil in exchange for your services. Don't spend it all in one place!
 8360: There you are, <Player>. I've got something I want to tell you about your egg!
 8361: There you are, <Player>! I've got something I want to tell you about $0!
 8362: That's about it for now. What are you here for today?
 8363: Hello, <Player>! What are you here for today?
 8364: Hello, <Player>!
 8365: Let's see how your egg is doing today...
 8366: Let's see how $0 is doing today...
 8367: I can't tell yet whether your chocobo will be a male or a female...
 8368: Your chocobo seems to be a $0[male/female]!
 8369: Strength: [Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]
 8370: Endurance: [Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]
 8371: Discernment: [Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]
 8372: Receptivity: [Poor/Substandard/A bit deficient/Average/Better than average/Impressive/Outstanding/First-class]
 8373: Regarding affection, it seems to [not care about you at all/be able to endure your company/slightly enjoy your company/like being around you/like you pretty well/like you a lot/want to be with you all the time/regard you as its parent].
 8374: Hmmm... Your chocobo seems to be [starving/quite hungry/a little hungry/neither hungry nor full/neither hungry nor full/almost full/quite full/completely full].
 8375: It looks like your chocobo's condition is stable. There have not been any changes worth mention.
 8376: Your chocobo's leg seems to be slightly wounded. $1 might help it heal.
 8377: Your chocobo seems to have a stomachache. $1 might help it feel better.
 8378: Your chocobo seems to be slightly ill. $1 might help it feel better.
 8379: Your chocobo is very ill. $1 might help it feel better.
 8380: Your chocobo is not receiving enough affection, and seems very depressed. You should pay more attention to your animal.
 8381: $0 has been receiving plenty of affection, and seems extremely happy. It is in excellent condition now!
 8382: $0 is sleeping soundly in order to heal its fatigue.
 8383: $0 seems bored and restless. You should give it something to do, like taking it out to race against other chocobos.
 8384: $0 is hopelessly spoiled! You should discipline it sometimes!
 8385: $0 ran away from the stables the moment I turned my back... It must have been upset about something. All we can do is wait for it to come back now.
 8386: $0 seems to have its head in the clouds lately... It must be in love.
 8387: Your chocobo has been making a real fuss at night lately. Such behavior is common for chicks, but you should deal with it as soon as possible.
 8388: $0 is so full of energy today!
 8389: $0 is unusually bright and focused today!
 8390: It [has a very easygoing personality/is rather ill-tempered/is a very patient chocobo/is quite sensitive/has a rather enigmatic personality], making it [easy to care for/ideal for military use/ideal for carrying goods/good with people/difficult to know what the animal is thinking].
 8391: Your chocobo [likes clear days/likes hot, sunny days/likes rainy days/likes sandstorms/likes windy days/likes snow/likes thunder/likes auroras/likes dark days/ /likes cloudy days.][./ and dislikes rainy days./ and dislikes thunder./ and dislikes windy days./ and dislikes snow./ and dislikes hot, sunny days/ and dislikes sandstorms./ and dislikes dark days./ and dislikes auroras.]
 8392: Last of all, your animal does not seem to know any abilities.
 8393: Last of all, your animal seems to have the ability "[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder]."
 8394: Last of all, your animal seems to have the abilities "[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder]" and "[--/Gallop/Canter/Burrow/Bore/Auto-Regen/Treasure Finder]."
 8395: Chocobos are delicate creatures, and their condition easily changes. The secret to raising a good chocobo is giving it plenty of care!
 8396: Your egg doesn't seem to be doing well at the moment. It would probably be best to leave it alone for a while.
 8397: $0 needs more energy before you can take care of it!
 8398: If you watch over $0, it will gradually return your affection.
 8399: Telling $0 a story will help it develop a healthy psychological state. Remember that concentrating on your speech will have a slightly tiring effect on your chocobo, though.
 8400: When $0 refuses to do anything but sleep or acts stubborn, you should discipline it. Remember that reproof is an act of love!
 8401: You're interested in entering your chocobo into competitions? Funny...there were three others who mentioned the same thing!
 8402: Well, it is good for their physical development, after all... I guess it's alright as long as they don't fight.
 8403: You can take your chocobo on a walk just outside of town. Because East Sarutabaruta is nearby, $0 shouldn't grow very tired.
 8404: You can take your chocobo on a walk a ways from town. The Tahrongi Canyon is not too far, so $0 shouldn't grow exhausted.
 8405: You can take your chocobo on a walk as far out as the Meriphataud Mountains. Being together so long should do wonders for the bond between you and $0.
 8406: This is the basic care plan for your chocobo. Under this plan, we will provide for your chocobo's most fundamental needs.
 8407: You can choose to give your chocobo a long rest. This will revitalize its energy and accelerate its recovery from injury or illness.
 8408: If you like, we can take your chocobo out on a walk through the safe areas of town. This should improve its physical condition.
 8409: Listening to music will make your chocobo a more refined creature, and should improve its mental condition.
 8410: Exercising alone will improve your chocobo's strength, but will have a slightly negative effect on its mental condition.
 8411: Exercising in a group will improve your chocobo's stamina, but will have a slightly negative effect on its mental condition.
 8412: Playing with children will improve your chocobo's intelligence, but will have a slightly negative effect on its physical condition.
 8413: Playing with other chocobos will improve your chocobo's receptivity, but will have a slightly negative effect on its physical condition.
 8414: You can earn some money by having your chocobo deliver packages for a transport agency.
 8415: Carrying heavy loads will improve its physical condition, but will inflict a certain amount of stress on the animal.
 8416: You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public. We will provide you with some gil as thanks for this service.
 8417: Interacting with the public will improve its mental condition, but will inflict a certain amount of stress on the animal.
 8418: You can send your chocobo to deliver official messages for Windurst, which will compensate you for your services.
 8419: Carrying someone on its back for a long period of time will build strength in your chocobo's legs, but will place some strain on the animal.
 8420: You can send your chocobo to dig for items to benefit the stables. We will thank you for your contribution with a certain amount of gil.
 8421: Digging for items will improve your chocobo's intelligence, but will place some strain on the animal.
 8422: Your chocobo can even appear in plays. You will receive payment for this service in gil.
 8423: Interacting with actors and the audience should improve the chocobo's receptivity, but the difficult practice will place some strain on the animal.
 8424: What's this? You want to give up on this egg, do you?
 8425: What's this? You don't want to raise $0 any more?
 8426: What? You want to stop raising $0 at a time like this?
 8427: You just started raising the poor creature! You're really sure you want to do this?
 8428: If you decide to quit, you'll never ever see $0 again! You really don't mind?
 8429: If you decide to quit, you will never see $0 again. Are you really willing to give up without even seeing its face one last time?
 8430: Fine. Then the stables will raise this egg. Do you have anything you have to say for yourself?
 8431: I guess if that's what you really want... Custody of $0 will be transferred to the stables. Do you have any last words for it?
 8432: Fine. When $0 returns, the stables will begin caring for it. Do you have anything you wish to say?
 8433: Is that so? This must be hard on you too, huh? Sorry...
 8434: Is that so? Then don't forget it!
 8435: ... I'm disappointed in you.
 8436: Some excuse... You haven't even seen its face yet, have you? Once you decide to raise an animal, you stick with it through to the end!
 8437: No matter how incompatible you feel you may be, once you decide to raise an animal, you should stick with it to the end!
 8438: We will. I'm sure you have your reasons, but it's still no excuse!
 8439: Of course not! Keep up the good work with your chocobo, all right?
 8440: You cannot retire a chocobo that has not been named.
 8441: You really want to retire $0?
 8442: Once you retire your chocobo, you won't be able to meet it anytime you want anymore. Are you okay with that?
 8443: Well, all right... Then $0 will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society farms.
 8444: Understood. $0 will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's farms as soon as it returns.
 8445: Parting with your chocobo is difficult, isn't it? Don't worry, though...you can see it again. Cheer up!
 8446: I'm sure it must be difficult not being able to say goodbye to $0. Don't worry, though...you can see it again. Cheer up!
 8447: I cannot issue any documents to a chocobo that has not been named.
 8448: A chococard contains all the vital information about the chocobo that you are raising.
 8449: Trade a chococard to the matchmaker in Jeuno, and you will be able to breed your animal with another chocobo. I can issue a chococard for $0 gil.
 8450: You can register a chocobo to respond to your call in the field. The chocobo will come to you when you use your $0.
 8451: Your chocobo's registered data determines certain features, such as its saddle, so it is wise to re-register from time to time.
 8452: You can register a retired chocobo by trading $0 to me.
 8453: All right, then. I'll get $0 ready.
 8454: All right, then. I'll get $0 ready as soon as it returns.
 8455: I will now register $0 to come when you call.
 8456: I'll take $0 gil for the preparations.
 8457: I've got your $0 right here. You can have it now.
 8458: You lost your $0?
 8459: Well, I guess I'll have to get another one from Hantileon. It's going to cost you $1 gil, though.
 8460: This item links you and $0 together. You would be wise not to lose it again.
 8461: It looks like you're taking good care of this. There seems to be no problem.
 8462: This $2's power to call your chocobo seems to have grown weak.
 8463: I can give you a new $2 in exchange for it if you wish.
 8464: Here you go. Take good care of it.
 8465: All right... You can have this back, then.
 8466: Here, let me give you a new $2 in exchange for this old one.
 8467: And don't worry about the usual fee. The $0 is all I'll be needing from you this time.
 8468: I still have not given your chocobo its food, so I will return it to you.
 8469: Your chocobo is sleeping soundly. Please wait until it awakens before feeding it.
 8470: Your chocobo has run away. Please wait until it returns and then feed it.
 8471: Your chocobo has not hatched, so you cannot feed it yet.
 8472: Alright. Let's give $0 its food.
 8473: I hope it gets well soon.
 8474: I hope we can make this animal into a fine chocobo!
 8475: I hope your chocobo awakens soon.
 8476: Ah, <Player>! I've been waiting for you. You can have this.
 8477: To enter your current chocobo in one of the CRA-sanctioned races, you will require $0.
 8478: You need only trade it to a CRA agent to complete the registration process.
 8479: Hi, <Player>! What's all this about?
 8480: I see... So it was wandering around lost, was it? Poor thing.
 8481: <Player>, do you think you could search for its owner? We'll take care of it here at the stables until you find who it belongs to.
 8482: I'm sure its owner is searching for the chick as well. You should probably check the areas where people take their chocobos on walks, first.
 8483: If you find anything, have a chat to Kiria-Romaria over there.
 8484: <Player>, have you had any luck locating the chick's owner? I've been collecting information, too!
 8485: The owner's name starts with the letter [ / / / /G/ /K/P].
 8486: The owner is [/ / / / / / / /a Tarutaru man/a Tarutaru woman/a Mithra].
 8487: The owner is [ / / / / /a guild worker/someone affiliated with one of the ministries/a hunter/an adventurer].
 8488: I'll do my own searching when I have the time. I hope we manage to find something.
 8489: I've got new information on the owner of the lost chick!
 8490: That's all I could find! The rest is up to you!
 8491: The chick's owner came and picked it up not long ago. I'm glad we found its rightful home.
 8492: I found the chick's owner and returned it to its home.
 8493: Oh dear... You see, that name violates VCS naming conventions. You'll have to choose another one, I'm afraid.
 8494: First, we must test the level of trust between you and $0.
 8495: Chocobos have a habit of hiding things that they consider valuable.
 8496: I'm sure even $0 hides things while you are not around...
 8497: Find an item it has hidden and bring it to me.
 8498: If you and $0 really have a trusting relationship, I'm sure you will be able to find something.
 8499: $0 is completely absorbed in its current activities.
 8500: What will you do? [Search for the chocobo's item./Watch over the chocobo.]
 8501: You find something in the ground.
 8502: You obtain $6!
 8503: There does not seem to be anything of particular notice here.
 8504: Kweh!
 8505: $0 appears to be very happy.
 8506: Kweh!!!
 8507: $0 noticed what you were doing...
 8508: You gave this to $0 when it was still a chick, didn't you?
 8509: It looks like $0 held the item very dear. Your bond with your chocobo seems very strong.
 8510: I have no qualms about entrusting you with this now.
 8511: One of the workers at our stable gave this to $0 when it was still a chick, right?
 8512: $0 seems to trust the stables' employees more than you...
 8513: At least you were able to find it, though... Here. You can have this.
 8514: Your egg feels the tender warmth of your gaze.
 8515: The chick inside the egg seems to want out...
 8516: The chick inside the egg seems to be anxious to meet you...
 8517: $0 looks happy to see you.
 8518: $0 doesn't look very happy...
 8519: $0 is in high spirits.
 8520: $0 looks irritated.
 8521: $0 is sleeping peacefully.
 8522: You feel a faint warmth in the room left behind by $0...
 8523: Now feeding the chocobo...
 8524: $1: #
 8525: <Player> gives the chocobo $3.
 8526: <Player> gives the chocobo its food.
 8527: $0 gobbles up the $3 in a single gulp!
 8528: $0 munches contentedly on the $3.
 8529: $0 eats the $3.
 8530: $0 quietly eats the food.
 8531: $0 seems to be forcing itself to eat the $3.
 8532: $0 seems to be forcing itself to eat the food.
 8533: $0 munches discontentedly on the $3.
 8534: $0 munches discontentedly on the food.
 8535: $0 munches weakly on the $3.
 8536: $0 munches weakly on the food.
 8537: $0 gulps down the $3!
 8538: $0 happily takes the $3.
 8539: $0 is forcing itself to take the $3.
 8540: $0 discontentendly swallows the $3.
 8541: $0 weakly swallows the $3.
 8542: $0 has found something!
 8543: $0 seems interested in your story.
 8544: Which would you like to talk about? [Random chitchat./An impatient chocobo./A curious chocobo./A worrisome chocobo./A youthful chocobo./A happy chocobo./A diligent chocobo.]
 8545: $0 learns the ability "Gallop"!
 8546: $0 learns the ability "Canter"!
 8547: $0 learns the ability "Burrow"!
 8548: $0 learns the ability "Bore"!
 8549: $0 learns the ability "Auto-Regen"!
 8550: $0 learns the ability "Treasure Finder"!
 8551: $0 doesn't seem to understand your story...
 8552: $0 is inspired by your story.
 8553: $0 hangs its head in shame.
 8554: $0 awakens from its sleep.
 8555: $0 is still fast asleep...
 8556: Don't feel too bad when you lose... You never stood a chance anyway!
 8557: W-wow... You're pretty fast!
 8558: Th-this is absurd...
 8559: You're lucky our chocobo wasn't feeling that well today. You would be eating our dust any other time!
 8560: This would never have happened if Bashraf hadn't been telling the chocobo those foolish stories...
 8561: That's not true! The chocobo always looked very interested in what I had to say!
 8562: I'm sure your chocobo would be, too. You should give it a try sometime!
 8563: Now have you learned never to underestimate $1?
 8564: This baby's going to earn us a mint at the races! As for you...at this rate, you'll need all the luck you can get to even earn the right to compete with me!
 8565: It's a tie!
 8566: Hey, your chocobo isn't half bad...
 8567: Hmph. If $1 had only been feeling up to it, we would have been here hours ago!
 8568: Luck was simply not with us today...
 8569: Well, hello there! You're out on a walk with your chocobo today, too?
 8570: Your chocobo is adorable, isn't it? It should get along with $1 just fine!
 8571: Cheep!
 8572: Keh!
 8573: Kweh!
 8574: $0 becomes friends with $1!
 8575: Oh, you're out walkin' your chocobo, too?
 8576: Mighty fine specimen ya got there. Let's see how well it gets along with $1 here...
 8577: You're out on a walk with your chocobo, too?
 8578: Nice-looking chocobo. Let's see how well it gets along with %1...
 8579: Good day to you, [Sir/Ma'am]! Fine day to walk a chocobo.
 8580: I must say, that is a fine specimen. I am curious to see how it would get along with my $1...
 8581: Hey! You're raising a chocobo, too?
 8582: Take a look at our chocobo. Is it not a splendid creature?
 8583: What'd you mean, why are all three of us raising one chocobo? Like an amateur would understand!
 8584: We're aiming to raise the best of the best...the creme de la creme of all chocobos!
 8585: Bashraf is fostering its psychological state.
 8586: Foudeel is working on its intelligence.
 8587: And I'm making it the strongest chocobo in Vana'diel!
 8588: Brilliant, right? What better way to raise a perfect animal than to divide the tasks and focus on each aspect wholeheartedly?
 8589: Sorry to be the bringer of bad news, but our chocobo is far superior to yours.
 8590: Do you not agree? Surely you would not have the nerve to suggest that your chocobo is...dare I say...better than ours?
 8591: But if you insist, a simple race will make the difference in quality quite clear. Try it if you still have any complaints, and may the best chocobo win.
 8592: Hey, I remember you!
 8593: I'm glad you're taking the time to take $0 out for fresh air. Keep up the good work!
 8594: Oh, there you are!
 8595: Glad to see you're taking $0 out on walks! Keep it up!
 8596: Well, what a coincidence.
 8597: I'm glad to see that you're taking $0 outside every now and then. Keep up the good work.
 8598: Well, well! Fine meeting you here, <Player>.
 8599: I am pleased to see that you are taking $0 outside every now and then. I hope you continue the fine work.
 8600: You should be starting to realize about now just how hard it is to raise a chocobo!
 8601: Don't forget that regular communication with your chocobo is important!
 8602: Let me teach you a story that I often recite to my chocobo. You should tell it to your chocobo, too!
 8603: You should be starting to realize about now just how hard it is to raise a chocobo...
 8604: Don't forget just how important regular communication with your chocobo is.
 8605: Let me teach you a story that I often recite to my chocobo. You should tell it to your chocobo, too.
 8606: You should be starting to realize about now just how hard it is to raise a chocobo.
 8607: Don't forget that regular communication with your chocobo is important.

 8610: Do not forget that regular communication with your chocobo is important.
 8611: Let me teach you a story that I often tell my chocobo. You should tell it to your chocobo, too.
 8612: Your chocobo seems to be getting along well with $1. Keep it up, okay?
 8613: Your chocobo seems to be getting along well with $1. Keep up the good work, ya hear?
 8614: Your chocobo seems to be getting along well with $1. Keep it up.
 8615: Your chocobo seems to be getting along well with $1. Keep it up.
 8616: Well, hello! I haven't seen you in forever. Is that your own chocobo?
 8617: Ever since you showed me the error of my ways, I've been goin' to meet my old chocobo practically every day now. I know Brutus's takin' good care of him, but I just can't help but wonder how he's doing.
 8618: Today when I went to the stables, Brutus was just about to take him out on a walk.
 8619: But when he saw me, he came runnin' over!
 8620: It looked like he wanted me to take him out...
 8621: Kweh!
 8622: Anyway, I'm glad he's happy. Don't you make the same mistakes I did, now.
 8623: Cheep!
 8624: Kwee!
 8625: Kweh!
 8626: Cheep.
 8627: The chocobo appears to be lost...
 8628: The chocobo chick appears to be lost...
 8629: What will you do? [Bring it home./Leave it.]
 8630: Cheep...
 8631: The chocobo chick follows <Player>...
 8632: You look like you have something you want to ask. What do you want?
 8633: The owner of a lost chick? Hm... This is just a hunch, but...

 8725: Welcome, ladies and gentlemen! It's time for another action-packed chocobo race! I'll be your commentator, Goccilo.
 8726: Our special guests today are everybody's favorite disgruntled chick, Sakura...
 8727: ...and her faithful servant/translator, Markovich.
 8728: Good day, fol--
 8729: $3s$3%1I
 8730: Sakura says that she loves you all from the bottom of her tiny heart.
 8731: Alrighty then, our next race features $0 of Vana'diel's top chocobos. Let us start off by introducing the birds and their jockeys.
 8732: First we have $0, who will be ridden by [the ace of the chase, Ignazio/three-time chocobo racing all$26star, Eudocia/the bloody emperor, Roinolier/the empress of speed, Maurette/Lami-Baami Suave Esquire III/the red rose of racing, Sosopapa/CRA legend, Khowa Mathgalhi/rising CRA star, Bayansh].
 8733: $3s$3%3s$3%1I
 8734: She says, "When the ace makes chase, there's not a bird in Vana'diel who can keep pace."
 8735: She says, "And you can bet the chocobo farm that this year it'll be 'four-time' all$25star!"
 8736: She says, "This jockey doesn't get his name because he yields to through traffic, if you know what I mean."
 8737: She says, "There isn't a jockey in Vana'diel who loves her steed more than the empress of speed."
 8738: She says, "This heart-throb treats his mounts like he treats his women--with an unparalleled sense of grace, a sixth sense, you could say."
 8739: She says, "Sosopapa has got the moves to make even the stiffest of necks turn."
 8740: She says, "This former racing champion has decided to temporarily come out of retirement (again) for what will be her final race."
 8741: She says, "This natural wasn't a born natural, but was born with natural ability that naturally transformed him into what we often call a 'natural.'"
 8742: Next we have [Pure Beauty/Ambitious Impact/Young Typhoon], being ridden by [the chocogirl next door, Hazina/dark chocostalker, Pikanza/self-proclaimed chocogeek, Qunbubu].
 8743: Sakura says, "Don't be fooled by the innocent smile--this girl will rip your chocobo's gizzard out and eat it for a late breakfast or early lunch!"
 8744: Sakura says, "This Galka's unrelenting love for all things chocobo makes him a dangerous opponent on the track."
 8745: Sakura says, "Thousands of hours of chocoresearch have sharpened the mind of this jolly jockey into a pointy stick, ready to poke and prod anyone who dares stand in her way."
 8746: Our next chocobo is [Shining Lady/Moon Night/Jet Fire], ridden by [Chanaille, a.k.a. Dances With Chocobos/the chocowhisperer, Sah Zhaowam/Sakura's number one fan, Chamu-Pashamu].
 8747: Sakura says, "Ain't no one knows a chocobo's heart like this here lil' lady."
 8748: Sakura says, "She has a good grasp of our vocabulary, but her pronunciation, especially her gutturals and fricatives, need a little work."
 8749: $3s$3%1`t
 8750: Sakura says she knows who she'll be rooting for this race...
 8751: The next contestant is [Invincible Ace/Gold Queen/Million Spirit], jockeyed by [chocobo reincarnate, Vieuballideme/hyper breeder, Graciela/20-year racing veteran, Mayza-Hapurza].
 8752: She says that simply smelling like a chocobo doesn't make one a chocobo.
 8753: She says that breeding chocobos is like stocking a warehouse with 10,000 opo-opos and 10,000 typewriters--you are bound to stumble across a masterpiece sooner or later.
 8754: She says that this Tarutaru has been practicing the choquestrian arts since he was only two years old.
 8755: And that's our lineup. Perhaps it is just me, but I have a feeling that today's match up will go down in the annals of racing history.
 8756: And here's today's lineup. What excitement lies in store for all our faithful chocofans listening on the CRA linkshell channel?
 8757: The contestants have arrived at the starting line, and the race will begin shortly.
 8758: Welcome, ladies and gentlemen to another round of awe-inspiring head-to-head chocobo racing! I am Goccilo, your master of ceremonies.
 8759: And joining us today are the commentating duo which require no introduction, the equally adroit and adorable Sakura...
 8760: ...and her obedient interpreter, everyone's favorite lover of animals, Markovich!
 8761: Good day, fol--
 8762: $3s$3%1I
 8763: Sakura would like to take this opportunity to speak out against fowl abuse across Vana'diel.
 8764: And on that note, here come our eight avian racers now!
 8765: #$4: $0 #$5: $1 #$6: $2 #$7: $3
 8766: And there's your lineup, folks! It looks like we're going to have a real doozy on our hands here today!
 8767: Well, let's get right down to it! The race is about to begin!
 8768: I must admit, I was a tad vexed about who our bird might be facing today, but I realize now that my petty presentiments were quite unfounded.
 8769: Yeah! What he said! You're lucky we're even letting you share the same track as Best!
 8770: Yeah... Good luck, <Player>...
 8771: Today's match is a head-to-head battle, with the winner taking all! Let's start off by introducing our two competitors.
 8772: And then we have the humbly named Best, being jockeyed by Aht Urhgan mercenary, [Bashraf/Foudeel/Wahboud].
 8773: Sakura says, "It's rumored that Bashraf doesn't give any orders to his chocobo at all. He only shows up because chapter 17, article LXIV of the CRA rulebook requires 'all mounts to be mounted.'"
 8774: Sakura says, "It's rumored that Foudeel often spends weeks planning out strategies for each of his two-minute races."
 8775: Sakura says to watch out. What Wahboud lacks in brains, talent, deftness, finesse, etcetera, he makes up for with his extra-large supply of spore bombs and pepper biscuits.
 8776: They say pictures are worth a thousand words, but your visage screams only one--fear.
 8777: Yeah! What he said! We lost last time, but we won't this time! Tell [him/her], Wahboud!
 8778: Fortune smiled on you before, but don't think you'll be so lucky this time!
 8779: As residing VCS president, I would be disgracing my position if I did not put my best into this race.
 8780: <Player>. It is time you proved your worth as a chocobo breeder.
 8781: Good luck, <Player>. I don't mean to braggy-wag, but with me in the race, you'll need it more than ever. Mwahahahahah!
 8782: Today's race is a head-to-head-to-head match-up between an adventurer, a mercenary, and a high-ranking VCS official. Now let's take a closer look at the participants!
 8783: And next we have [Air/Blood/Spring], ridden by [VCS president, Hantileon/advanced chocobo trainer, Zopago/advanced chocobo trainer, Pulonono].
 8784: $3s$3%3bI
 8785: Sakura says, "Any chocobo trainer that preaches 'tough love' needs to be gently nudged off the sacrificial altar in Ifrit's Cauldron."
 8786: Sakura says, "Any chocobo trainer with a tail has my complete endorsement."
 8787: Sakura says, "Big things often come in small packages."
 8788: Ladies and gentlemen! The 26th sovereign of the mighty Kingdom of San d'Oria, Destin R d'Oraguille, has called for a grand tournament--
 8789: a 300-year tradition extending back to the days of the Warking, Acheufagais R d'Oraguille--The d'Oraguille Victory Malm!
 8790: This is Goccilo, and I will be bringing you the breathtaking play-by-play.
 8791: Joining us today is none other than His excellent Excellency, San d'Oria's one and only prince regent, Pieuje I d'Oraguille!
 8792: It says here that your very own chocobo, Noble Rose, will be running the malm. What do you feel are her chances of taking home the coveted "piece de resistance"?
 8793: We have spent many hours training this fine steed in the arts of war. We do not believe there exists another bird in the Kingdom, nay, the world, who might best our Noble Rose.
 8794: Well, there you have it.
 8795: Now let's take a look at today's participants...
 8796: Ladies and gentlemen! President of the Bastokan Republic, Hrichter Karst, proudly presents...
 8797: ...the most prestigious chocobo race in all of southern Quon--the Gustaberg Derby!
 8798: Joining me today is Metalworks mastermind, Cid.
 8799: Mr. Cid... May I call you Mr. Cid? Just Cid? Alright. Cid, what can you tell us about your entry in the derby, Infinity XIII?
 8800: Absolutely nothing! Do you think I would divulge the secret training methods my team developed to make Infinity the fastest bird this side of Vana'diel!?
 8801: Ladies and gentlemen! Minister Apururu and over a hundred 'hands' from Windurst's Manustery have converged here today to bring you a race originally established by chocobo-loving Star Sibyl, Rakapopo--
 8802: The Rakapopo Cup!
 8803: Today's guest is Heavens Tower's number-one secretariat extraordinaire--Ku`pipi`!
 8804: So`,t I've lea`rned that yo`u have enteredt your ve`ry own pe`rsona`lt cho`cobo in the cu`p.t Wha`t do yo`u think hert cha`nces are of ta`kingt ho`me the gra`nd pri`ze?t
 8805: Are yo`u making fun of me, si`r!? We`ll, you may be laughing now, but I will be the one busting my` gutty-wutty when my Starlight sai`ls across the finish line yea`rs before the nearest competitaru!t
 8806: Ah yes, we have heard much of this master of the reins. We sense a great warrior under that unassuming guise.
 8807: My, this bird has quite a long list of accomplishments under its...uh...stirrups. He just might give my Invincible XIII a run for his money!
 8808: [Ace of the space/Three-time chocobo racing all$26star/Bloody emperor/Empress of tweed/Whachamacallit Esquire III/Dead rose of racing/CRA legend/CRA rising star]? Ne`ver heard of [him/her/him/her/him/her/her/him]!
 8809: We seem to recall exchanging pleasantries with this fine maiden at one "Kamp Kweh." We are quite impressed with her rapid progress.
 8810: Chocostalker? Perhaps this young man needs another hobby...
 8811: Chocogeek, chocofreak. It'll take mo`re than an embiggened brainy-wa`iny to beat Starlight!t
 8812: What a queer soubriquet... We shall see if this character truly can read the hearts of her chocobos.
 8813: Hmph... There are some things that cannot be expressed through mere words...
 8814: Hey! I'm Sakura's biggest fa`n! I won't let Starlight lo`se to some impo`ster!
 8815: Noble Rose expressed acute interest in this so-called "reincarnate's" redolent aura. Might he truly be... Absurd!
 8816: Alright, so she can breed. But can she race?
 8817: Hah! Well, I` have been riding cho`cobos for twenty-one years!
 8818: And next is [Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight], being ridden by [San d'Orian monarlais, Halver M Borel/Number 5 Mithril Musketeer, Naji/Aurastery minister, Koru-Moru/San d'Orian Conflict commander, Excenmille M Aurchiat/Number 4 Mythril Musketeer, Ayame/former Rhinostery minister, Yoran-Oran]!
 8819: Halver has claimed to detest all things chocobo. However, for some reason, there has yet to be a bird that has shunned the monarlais. Perhaps he reminds the whelps of their mothers.
 8820: Bet you didn't know Naji has his own bird. Hasn't won a race in three years, though...
 8821: Both Starlight a`nd the professor hate to take orders... Maybe tha`t's why they're such a perfect combination! Each thinks they're the one in control!t
 8822: The commander is an exceptional leader. It is difficult to imagine there is a chocobo on Vana'diel that he could not humble.
 8823: When Ayame's not training, she's down at the stables taking care of Infinity. A great girl, she is.
 8824: When the profe`ssor's not stumbling over his spee`ch impediment-ethy, he's re`searching the intricacies of chocobo beha`vioral patterns.
 8825: And they're off!
 8826: Markovich, what did you think of the start?
 8827: Well, I fel--
 8828: $3s$3%3s$3%3bI
 8829: Sakura says it was a picture-perfect start and that I need to shut my mouth.
 8830: Ah! It looks like one of the birds was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?
 8831: Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the birds has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?
 8832: And as they pass the halfway mark...
 8833: #$1 $0 holds on to the lead!
 8834: $0 different chocobos continue their battle for the lead!
 8835: While from behind the pack, #$1 $3 seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!
 8836: While from behind, #$2 $0 seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!
 8837: All $0 chocobos battle for the lead!
 8838: Neither of these two rivals are willing to yeild to the other! What an amazing race!
 8839: And would you look at that! Quite a battle is brewing in the tunnel!
 8840: $3s$3%3s$3%1I
 8841: Sakura says, "The race ain't over until the fat chocobo sings."
 8842: What's this!? #$1 $0's jockey has pulled out $2!
 8843: What's this!? #$1 $0's jockey has pulled out $2!
 8844: Incredible! $0's speed is approaching dangerous limits!
 8845: It looks like $0 is storing its stamina for one final dash to the finish!
 8846: $0 looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.
 8847: $0's speed has begun to drop off!
 8848: It looks like $0 has begun to tire!
 8849: The speed of the other chocobos has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
 8850: The opponent's speed has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
 8851: The nearby chocobos are beginning to look confused! I doubt if their jockeys will be able to use any more items!
 8852: The other chocobo is beginning to look confused! I doubt if its jockey will be able to use any more items!
 8853: The rain has stopped and the clouds have begun to part! Could this be a blessing for $0!?
 8854: Oh my! It has started to rain! Could this be a blessing for $0!?
 8855: And yet $0 seems completely unaffected by the attack!
 8856: And yet the chocobos seem completely unaffected by the attack!
 8857: And now they're approaching the final corner!
 8858: #$1 $0 still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?
 8859: It's crowded up front with $0 chocobos still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?
 8860: #$1 $3 is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?
 8861: It's crowded up front with all $0 chocobos still fighting for the lead!
 8862: The two chocobos are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!
 8863: It doesn't look like anyone will be catching #$1 $0 today!
 8864: And $0 takes the crown!
 8865: What's this? #$1 $0 is making its move on the lead!
 8866: And it's $0 by a beak!!!
 8867: Let's take a look at the results...
 8868: $2: $0 (#$1)
 8869: There you have it! If you had told me that's how it'd end up, I never would have believed you!
 8870: Now let's see what our resident expert has to say about the race.
 8871: Sakura says that great races like the one we just witnessed come along only once in a blue or green moon.
 8872: Sakura says that this was one of the best races she has seen in ages.
 8873: What an amazing race! The other chocobos were no match for [Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight]. Can you give us a few words on your bird's stellar performance?
 8874: What an outcome! Who would have imagined that the mighty [Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight] could be toppled from its throne? Do you have any comments on your bird's performance?
 8875: [Halver/Excenmille] and Noble Rose both exceeded our expectations. Tonight, we shall hold a grand feast in honor of the victors!
 8876: The failures of today are the stairways to the victories of tomorrow. Once the jockey has received his lashings, he will begin preparations for the next race.
 8877: Performance of the bird? Without the hard work, sweat, and ingenuity of my race team, Infinity XIII would still be trying to find his way to the starting line! High-tech training! That's the wave of the future!
 8878: Oh well... I guess it's back to the drawing board...
 8879: Exactly as I expected, Gocci! Exa`ctly as I expected!t
 8880: The race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you! There was no wa`y Starlight could lose! Her horoscope sai`d so!
 8881: And there you have it. This is Goccilo, signing off! See you next time, chocofans!
 8882: And now, let's see the results from the last race.
 8883: $2: $0 (#$1)
 8884: And that's all she wrote, folks!
 8885: The winnings for a $0-$1 bet come to $2 gil per quill!
 8886: Phew! Another nail-biter in the record books! Sakura, any thoughts on that exceptional race?
 8887: She says that with so many spirited competitors, it's a shame that they can't all be winners!
 8888: She says that such exhilarating races always get her competitive juices flowing.
 8889: Until next time, race fans...
 8890: Now, let us move on to the awards ceremony.
 8891: Taking the crown for today's race was none other than $0!
 8892: To the winning steed's owner we present the $3, $1, and the exalted title of "Rocochookie," I mean, "Chocorookie"!
 8893: And to the ambitious and sporting <Player>, we present this undeniably useful $0!
 8894: Good show, <Player>. However, we must confess, we did not fathom we would be here handing away the laurels intended for Noble Rose.
 8895: Excellent race, <Player>! You'll have to tell me later what kind of training you've been doing.
 8896: Okay, ma`ybe your chocobo is pretty fast... But I sti`ll think the race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you!
 8897: Sakura says that she's seen better-conditioned chocobos at the local morgue.
 8898: But she also wants to congratulate it on its performance.

 8912: Welcome to the Chocobo Racing Association's (CRA) [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] branch. This service desk is here to accommodate our beginning and intermediate racers.
 8913: I am sorry, but there are no races scheduled at the moment.
 8914: Participation in our organization's races requires that you either possess $0 or currently have your own full-grown chocobo.
 8915: How about you, [sir/ma'am]?
 8916: If possible, we would like you to join us, and help show those trainers in [Bastok and Windurst/San d'Oria and Windurst/San d'Oria and Bastok] which racing team is truly the best in Vana'diel.
 8917: What do you say? [Tell me more./Sign me up!/Not today.]
 8918: Congratulations, <Player>! You are now an official member of the CRA's [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team.
 8919: I see. Please come back if you ever change your mind!
 8920: What would you like to know? [Why race chocobos, anyway?/How do I register for a race?/How do I prepare for a race?/What are chocobucks?/What kind of races are there?/What are "racing teams"?/Quit./Return.]
 8921: Why not!? Our original plan was to establish locations across Vana'diel where people could test their birds' skills.
 8922: We felt that this would help us maintain breeder motivation, which in turn would ensure healthier, happier chocobos. A "win-win situation," as we like to call it in the business.
 8923: However, as rumors of these new facilities began to leak out into the world, people began speculating about the possibility of officially sanctioned chocobo races...
 8924: The VCS could not ignore the voice of the masses, and it was not long before a meeting was held, a vote was taken, and the CRA was formed.
 8925: And that's why I'm here, trying to enlist you and other top breeders into our noble ranks.
 8926: Oh, and for our more seasoned veterans who feel there are no challenges left for them here at the track, the CRA has finished preparing a new race. And rumor has that it's a doozie!
 8927: First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.
 8928: Next, you must bring me either $0 or $1. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.
 8929: As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.
 8930: Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.
 8931: Once you have registered your chocobo and entered it in a competition, the CRA will proceed in assigning it a licensed jockey.
 8932: Before each race you will be given the opportunity to give the jockey specific orders on his or her riding style.
 8933: In addition to these orders, you can also provide the jockey with items to use while riding, as well as equipment to improve your chocobo's performance.
 8934: Before a race, you can also check the strengths and weaknesses of the other participating chocobos. It is recommended that you use this data when deciding on what orders to give, or which items to equip.
 8935: Depending on your chocobo's performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint chocobucks.
 8936: Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.
 8937: Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.
 8938: There are two main types of races.
 8939: The first type is called an official race. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.
 8940: Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.
 8941: You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.
 8942: However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.
 8943: The second type of race is called a free run. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match.
 8944: You must pay a fee in gil to participate in free runs, but you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo's performance. You can join as many free runs as you wish in a single day (Earth time), but extra fees may be required for each additional race. (Stable hands have to make a living, too!)
 8945: The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.
 8946: Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.
 8947: Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.
 8948: In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.
 8949: You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.
 8950: Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).
 8951: Ah, it says here that you are a member of the [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team.
 8952: Have you come today to change your affiliation?
 8953: Remember, you will not be able to use any chocobucks earned in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] here, and you will also lose any Solo Victory Points that you may have. Are you sure you want to go through with this?
 8954: Join this team? [Yes./No.]
 8955: Congratulations! You are the newest member of the CRA's [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team!
 8956: Understood. But remember, we are always looking for great racers like you to join our team. If you ever change your mind, I'll be right here waiting.
 8957: Ah, so you have brought items for your chocobo.
 8958: What do we have here...
 8959: #:
 8960: Alright, <Player>, I will store this in our safe.
 8961: Alright, <Player>, I will store these in our safe.
 8962: I am sorry, but you have already brought me one of those.
 8963: I am sorry, but you have already brought me these items.
 8964: Hello! What might I interest you in today?
 8965: (You have $3 [chocobuck/chocobucks].) [Chocobo [registration/confirmation]./Item confirmation./Free run ($1 gil)./Official race ($2 [chocobuck/chocobucks])./Re-run./Rule confirmation./Nothing.]
 8966: (You have $3 [chocobuck/chocobucks].) [Chocobo [registration/confirmation]./Item confirmation./Free run ($1 gil)./Official race./Re-run./Rule confirmation./Nothing.]
 8967: You cannot access this menu until you have registered a chocobo to race.
 8968: To register your chocobo, you must first bring me either $0 or $1.
 8969: You can only register one chocobo at a time, but you may always register a new one whenever you wish.
 8970: We currently hold for you: [/$1./$2./$3./$4./$5./$6./$7./$8./$9./$10./$11./$12./$13./$14./$15./$16./$17./$18./$19./$20./$21./$22./$23./$24./$25./$26./$27./$28./$29./$30./Quit./Return.]
 8971: With newly developed CRA technology, you can now relive the excitement of a previously cleared official race!
 8972: You may participate in these "re-runs" as many times as you wish, but just remember--the race may be the same, but the prizes for placing won't!
 8973: Re-run which race? [Novice Race I./Novice Race II./Novice Race III./Challenge Race I./International Race I./International Race II./Challenge Race II./CRA Classic./Quit./Return.]

 8981: $26Novice Race I$26 Chocobos: 4 Objective: Place 3rd or higher

 9032: So you wish to register a chocobo.
 9033: Let me see... $1 has already been registered.
 9034: Do you wish to cancel $1's registration and sign up $0?

 9037: Very well.
 9038: I'm sorry. You have already registered that chocobo. You may race it at any time.
 9039: I'm sorry. Things are a little confusing now with all these entries. Would you mind coming back a little later? Thank you.
 9040: I'm sorry. The other chocobos have not finished resting. Please come back a little later.

 9042: Greetings! I've been sent by the VCS to observe the final touches being put on our new racing facilities.
 9043: In addition, my colleagues and I will spend the next few weeks training for our positions as receptionists, vendors, and announcers.
 9044: Our grand opening is but a few days away. I hope to see you and all of your companions back for the big event!
 9045: Ah, <Player>. We have been holding on to the prize from your last race until you had room enough in your gobbiebag to carry it back to your Mog House.
 9046: Might you be <Player>? Excellent. VCS headquarters was informed that you would be stopping by our branch, and sent this package containing the prize from your last race.
 9047: <Player>, thank you for waiting.
 9048: Much to the VCS and the CRA's delight, the recent efforts of chocobo breeders across Vana'diel has helped to generate an unprecedented amount of interest in our endeavor. More people than ever have begun to express an interest in raising their own chocobo.

 9118: Preparing for next race.
 9119: I am currently accepting race applications.
 9120: I'm sorry, but I am currently not accepting race applications.
 9121: What would you like to do? [View race information./View personal data./Change racing teams./Quit.]
 9122: What would you like to do? [View race information./View personal data./Change racing teams./Jockey orders: [Sprint/Keep pace/Final spurt]./Equipment: $1./Equipment: None./Sign up your chocobo to race./Quit.]
 9123: Here you can sign up your race chocobo to take part in our races.
 9124: Please note that once you sign up for a race, you will be unable to compete again for a period of 20 hours (Earth time).
 9125: All right. First of all, we will have to choose a saddle for your mount.
 9126: Which saddle would you like to use? [Lauan saddle./Ash saddle./Elm saddle./Brass saddle./Silver saddle./Mythril saddle./Grass saddle./Cotton saddle./Linen saddle./Rabbit hide saddle./Sheep leather saddle./Buffalo leather saddle./Quit.]
 9127: A standard model, the lauan saddle will stabilize your chocobo's stride.
 9128: A standard model, the ash saddle will stabilize your chocobo's stride. It also increases your mount's endurance.
 9129: A standard model, the elm saddle will stabilize your chocobo's stride. It also increases your mount's endurance.
 9130: A bit on the hefty side, the brass saddle can be somewhat taxing on a chocobo's endurance. It compensates for this, however, by increasing the bird's strength.
 9131: A bit on the hefty side, the silver saddle can be somewhat taxing on a chocobo's endurance. It compensates for this, however, by increasing the bird's strength.
 9132: A bit on the hefty side, the mythril saddle can be somewhat taxing on a chocobo's endurance. It compensates for this, however, by increasing the bird's strength.
 9133: This lightweight grass saddle can create a marked improvement in physical performance. However, a chocobo will require some degree of discernment to reap its benefits.
 9134: This lightweight cotton saddle can create a marked improvement in physical performance. However, a chocobo will require some degree of discernment to reap its benefits.
 9135: This lightweight linen saddle can create a marked improvement in physical performance. However, a chocobo will require some degree of discernment to reap its benefits.
 9136: Crafted from the finest rabbit hide, this saddle can improve physical performance, but only for chocobos with at least moderate receptivity.
 9137: Crafted from the finest sheep leather, this saddle can improve physical performance, but only for chocobos with at least moderate receptivity.
 9138: Crafted from the finest buffalo leather, this saddle can improve physical performance, but only for chocobos with at least moderate receptivity.
 9139: Now that that's settled, if you'd kindly select the lane in which you'd like to race. The lanes are numbered in ascending order from innermost to outermost. The following lanes are now available:
 9140: In which lane would you like to race? [Lane 1./Lane 2./Lane 3./Lane 4./Lane 5./Lane 6./Lane 7./Lane 8./Quit.]
 9141: I know that look! Lane $0 it is!
 9142: Race fees will include a charge of $0 gil and $1 [chocobuck/chocobucks].
 9143: Do you wish to proceed? [Yes! I'm ready to tear up the track!/I'm getting cold feet...]
 9144: Very well. You have now been registered to race.
 9145: My apologies, but it seems that over four weeks have elapsed since your last race. As much as it pains me to do so, I will be forced to deduct $0 Solo Victory [Point/Points] from your account.
 9146: I'm sorry, but I am unable to process your registration at this time.
 9147: I apologize, but the slot you have applied for has already been taken.
 9148: I understand your eagerness, but sadly, not enough time has passed for you to register for a new race. Please try again later.
 9149: I'm sorry, but only racers affiliated with one of the three recognized racing teams are eligible for signup.
 9150: It seems you have not yet fulfilled the necessary requirements for race eligibility. I'm sorry, but I cannot sign up your chocobo.
 9151: We look forward to seeing you again.
 9152: The race you have signed up for will begin shortly. Please stand by until then.
 9153: We regret to inform you that the race you had signed up for has been cancelled. We apologize for any inconvenience.
 9154: Of course, we will return your $0 and refund your racing fee. Also, your eligibility to race will be reestablished immediately. Thank you for your understanding.
 9155: Your racing fees have been refunded.
 9156: You must join a racing team before participating in any races.
 9157: Affiliate yourself with a racing team? [Absolutely./Not right now.]
 9158: Which team would you like to join? [San d'Oria, for the glory of the kingdom!/My allegiance lies with Bastok!/Windurst till death!/Quit.]
 9159: Led by advanced chocobo trainer Hantileon, Team San d'Oria is steeped in tradition, much like the kingdom itself.
 9160: Team Bastok is headed by advanced chocobo trainer Zopago, and has always prided itself on its rich history.
 9161: Team Windurst places emphasis on their achievements, as exemplified by their leader, advanced chocobo trainer Pulonono.
 9162: Join the [ /San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team? [Yes, at once./No, not now.]
 9163: If you would just wait one moment while I fill out the necessary paperwork...
 9164: Congratulations, <Player>! You have just become the newest member of the [ /San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team!
 9165: You really want to nullify your affiliation with the [ /San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team and join another?
 9166: Changing team affiliation will result in you losing all of the Solo Victory Points you currently have accumulated. Can you live with that?
 9167: Change teams? [Yes, I'm outta here./No, I'll stay.]
 9168: Your current statistics are:
 9169: Solo Victory Points: $0 Number of races: $1 First-place finishes: $2 That's it.

 9210: Helping your team into first will give you certain advantages over your rivals! That should give you something to strive for!
 9211: What would you like to know about? [The promenade./Chocobet centers./The grandstand./Portals./Guides./Nothing for now.]
 9212: Shops, as well as attendants to assist you in siging up your chocobo for a race, are located on the promenade.
 9213: It can be found just south of here.
 9214: The promenade itself is split into eastern and western halves, both of which house all of the same facilities. Be sure to stop by and have a look when you get a chance.
 9215: Attendants at the chocobet centers are there to assist you with acquiring $0, as well as collecting your winnings.
 9216: There are a total of five centers readily available for your convenience, each of which are located near the transportation portals. There are two to the east and west of here, and one just to the north.
 9217: All chocobet centers are capable of providing the same services.
 9218: The grandstand faces the racetrack itself, and allows spectators to sit and enjoy the races in comfort.
 9219: To get there, just follow the red carpet all the way through the betting area. You can't miss it.
 9220: The standard admission fee is $0 gil. Patrons who possess $6 may enter free of charge.
 9221: $5 will be provided anytime you purchase $0 or sign up for a race.
 9222: Your $3 will become invalid as soon as you leave the grandstand. Reentry will require you to pay an additional admission fee.
 9223: This racetrack is equipped with portals to transport our patrons to any of the three nations, as well as Jeuno and Al Zahbi.
 9224: As you can see, we are regularly visited by a multitude of race fans, breeders, and jockeys from every realm imaginable. We have therefore relegated each portal to a single destination in an attempt to avoid congestion.
 9225: For the same reasons, we ask that visitors refrain from setting up bazaars while here. Violators of this rule will be severely punished. Your cooperation is appreciated.
 9226: Guides can be found throughout the premises waiting to assist you.
 9227: They can help by transporting you to the location of your choice.
 9228: This service is provided free of charge, so please don't hesitate to make use of it.
 9229: What would you like to know about? [Racing teams./Race rules./Race types./Victory points./Race Progression./That's about it.]
 9230: A race chocobo's owner or jockey may join one of the three racing teams by registering at the appropriate VCS branch.
 9231: Each nation's Team Victory Points are the sum total of all of its members' Solo Victory Points. The Team Victory Point totals are then used to determine the overall weekly standings.
 9232: In order to race your chocobo here, we ask that you please affiliate yourself first with one of the three teams.
 9233: For details, please check with your local CRA racing center.
 9234: The races held here are almost identical to the official and private races held at the other racetracks.
 9235: What distinguishes our races is the fact that victories here qualify you to collect larger cash purses, as well as Victory Points.
 9236: Eligibility to participate in the higher-level races will require a certain number of Solo Victory Points.
 9237: Depending on a team's weekly standings, its members may suffer certain eligibility restrictions. At the same time, they may also be privy to certain benefits.
 9238: The teams in second and third place will have the advantage of being allowed more entry positions in any given race, while those of the leading team are restricted.
 9239: The leading team will, however, be granted the privilege of selecting higher-quality saddles for their race chocobos.
 9240: The CRA reserves the right to impose a handicap system when it is determined that the gap in skill between chocobos is simply too great to make for a fair race.
 9241: In such an event, the "less endowed" of the chocobos will be granted certain enhancing effects, such as Haste or Refresh.
 9242: Whether handicaps will be enforced or not will be determined after signups are complete. Make sure to keep an eye on your chocobo's settings.
 9243: Each race title will include a code, such as C4. This code is the "race grade."
 9244: For example, a "C4 Chocobo Race" would indicate a typical grade 4 race.
 9245: We have four race grades, ranging from C4 to C1. The lower the number, the higher the grade. This, of course, means larger entry fees, but also more prize money.
 9246: No matter which race you enter, upon completion you will be prevented from joining any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time). Higher-grade races carry larger purses, so most racers like to use their opportunities to go after those.
 9247: Solo Victory Points will be awarded to you every race, depending on how well you finish.
 9248: As your Solo Victory Points accumulate, your chocobo will be able to gain entry to high-grade races.
 9249: Should a racer return to the circuit after an absence of four weeks or more, the CRA will be forced to deduct a number of Solo Victory Points.
 9250: Only on the rarest of occasions will such penalties be imposed. However, there are some races in which you will be unable to participate if you do not have a certain amount of Solo Victory Points in your possession.
 9251: Also, obtaining Solo Victory Points will also grant your nation Team Victory Points.
 9252: The three teams are in constant competition with one another, and a weekly ranking system is in place based on Team Victory Point totals.
 9253: As a team climbs up in rank, certain benefits will follow. You may see new items available for purchase with chocobucks, preferential treatment at the races, and so on.
 9254: Keep in mind that should you change your team affiliation, you will be forced to forfeit any accumulated Solo Victory Points.
 9255: We have a total of four races that run in succession.
 9256: Each race has its own dedicated signup window. Here there will be four attendants ready to serve all your racing needs.
 9257: Even if the race registration at one window closes, registration for the next race will begin immediately at the neighboring window.
 9258: Races will be held one after the other, so you'll have plenty of chances to watch and bet. Sit back, relax, and enjoy!
 9259: What would you like to hear more about? [Race preparations./Signup procedure./Collecting winnings./Signing up for another race./I'm fine, thanks.]
 9260: There are a few facts that you should know before running in a race.
 9261: First of all, you absolutely must be affiliated with one of the three official racing teams. These, as you may already know, are San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst.
 9262: Secondly, it is required that your bird be registered as a "race chocobo," for obvious reasons. No race chocobo, no race.
 9263: Thirdly, you will be responsible for providing your own items to be used during the race. The CRA leaves this to the racer's discretion...
 9264: All of these services can be provided at any racing center, but to facilitate the registration process it is recommended that you conduct all such affairs at the appropriate branch.
 9265: A racing fee is necessary to gain entry into a chocobo race. The racing center will inform you of the cost, so please be sure to pay when signing up for a race.
 9266: Also, when signing up to race, you will be able to choose a saddle, as well as the lane in which your chocobo will race.
 9267: There are multifarious saddles at the rider's disposal, each of which will affect your chocobo's conditioning. In addition, the types of saddles available will change depending on your team's current ranking.
 9268: There are a total of eight lanes, but general conditions for all of them are the same. Feel free to race in the lane of your choice.
 9269: Setting these options will complete the signup process. You will then be given $0, which you will need to exchange later to collect any winnings.
 9270: In the event that you should lose or misplace your $0, you will be unable to collect any prize money, chocobucks, or Victory Points that you may be entitled to. I cannot stress enough how important it is to hold on to it.
 9271: The races can be viewed from our grandstand area. Take a seat and cheer on your bird!
 9272: You will be eligible for prize money if your chocobo places either first, second, or third.
 9273: To collect, simply hand in the $0 you received during race signup at any signup center.
 9274: The amount of gil, chocobucks, and Victory Points you qualify to receive will be based upon your bird's placement.
 9275: You will lose the right to collect your winnings from a race exactly one week after that race has ended.
 9276: After participating in a race, your chocobo will be unable to join any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time).
 9277: This pertains only to races held here, and will not affect your eligibility for races held at any other racetracks.
 9278: We have implemented these restrictions here as to allow the greatest number of participants' entry into our races. Your patience and understanding are appreciated.
 9279: What would you like to ask? [What is chocobetting?/How do I bet?/What are odds?/When do I bet?/How do I collect winnings?/Nothing.]
 9280: Chocobetting is a form of entertainment where bettors attempt to pick the two birds that will finish first and second in a race.
 9281: To make it a bit more interesting, the bettor can then wager on their picks in increments of 100 gil.
 9282: Should lady luck smile upon you and your picks hit, you can win prize money, the amount of which is determined by the odds for that race.
 9283: For example, let's say that you were to bet ten quills (1000 gil) on Entries No. 5 and No. 7.
 9284: And let's say that the toteboard showed the odds for the race at 110 gil. If your picks were to finish as the top two birds, you would be eligible to collect 1100 gil in winnings, for a total profit of 100 gil.
 9285: Of course, it goes without saying that should your picks not have the fortune of finishing in the top two places, you will receive absolutely no gil.
 9286: The gambler's fallacy is our mantra here at the racetrack! Remember, you are special! Let it ride!
 9287: To place a chocobet, you must obtain $0 from the chocobet center.
 9288: For any single $0, a bettor may purchase up to 999 quills. Each quill costs 100 gil.
 9289: We highly recommend that you obtain information on the chocobos you will be betting on before purchasing your ticket. It is always good to know where your money is going.
 9290: Odds determine how much gil you will receive in winnings per quill on your chocobet ticket.
 9291: Winnings are calculated by taking the total monetary sum of all bets for any given pairing. For example, should ten bettors each place the same 100-quill (10,000 gil) chocobet, the total used to determine the winnings would be 100,000 gil.
 9292: It goes without saying that not all bettors will be winners. The money from losing bets is used to pay off the winners.
 9293: What this means is that if you place a bet on an unseemly chocobo pairing, or pick two birds without much money riding on them, and are fortunate enough to win, you can make quite a tidy sum.
 9294: Toteboards display the odds at both the chocobet center as well as the grandstand. Toteboards have eight columns with the number on top of each column representing one chocobo, and the number to the left of each column representing another. If your bet is for chocobos No. 2 and No. 5, check the #2 column to see how much a 2-5 bet will pay per quill.
 9295: The odds are constantly changing right up until the race begins. If the number of bets on a popular chocobo pairing keeps increasing, then consequently the odds will go down.
 9296: Even if you place a large bet early on, the odds may still change as time passes. So take your time and consider carefully.
 9297: Chocobets can be placed as soon as the signup period for a race has ended. The betting window will close several minutes before the race begins.
 9298: Make sure to get your bet in on time. Even if you are in the middle of placing a bet, it will be cancelled if you exceed the allowed time window by even a single second.
 9299: Once the race is finished, you can exchange your $0 at any chocobet center to collect your winnings.
 9300: Without $0 you will be unable to collect your winnings, so make sure not to lose it.
 9301: $0 is valid for up to one week (Earth time) after completion of the race for which it was purchased.
 9302: Should one week pass, we will be unable to accept the ticket, so it is always best to cash out as soon as possible.

 9357: Greetings, and welcome to the Chocobo Racing Association's (CRA) [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] branch. This service area is here to accommodate our more experienced and accomplished racers.
 9358: I am truly sorry [sir/ma'am], but we are unable to service your request here. This service area only caters to [San d'Orian/Bastokan/Windurstian] CRA Classic winners.
 9359: Registration for such an event can be carried out at the service areas for beginning and intermediate racers. Please speak to the attendants there for further assistance.
 9360: The organizing attendants in each location are as follows: [Southern San d'Oria: Alangriche/Bastok Mines: Jazgeh/Windurst Waters: Turumi-Byrumi] [Northern San d'Oria: Monteverle/Bastok Markets: Galienne/Windurst Port: Lhimo Keanyohn] [Port San d'Oria: Ramiene/Port Bastok: Salvador/Windurst Woods: Rungaga].
 9361: For beginning and intermediate races, you'll want to speak with [Alangriche/Jazgeh/Rungaga].
 9362: My apologies, [sir/ma'am], but it appears that you have yet to conduct all of the necessary processing at the service area for beginning and intermediate racers. Please speak to the attendants there for further assistance.
 9363: My apologies, [sir/ma'am], but it appears that you have yet to conduct all of the necessary processing at the service area for advanced and veteran racers. Please speak to the attendants there for further assistance.
 9364: Which would you like to hear about? [CRA rationale behind veteran races./How do I register for a race?/How do I prepare for a race?/What are chocobucks?/What kinds of races are there?/What are "racing teams"?/What about race opponents?/Quit./Return.]
 9365: With the establishment of the Chocobo Circuit and the introduction of chocobo races, the hidden talents of a number of chocobos across Vana'diel finally had a venue in which to come to fruition.
 9366: As the next step, the CRA recognized these rare and valuable talents, and developed a new, special kind of race to showcase them even more than before!
 9367: "The Monster Races"!
 9368: Without the interference of jockeys, breeders can now pit their chocobos head-to-head against a number of monster species in brutal, raw, no-holds-barred racing!
 9369: Even some of the CRA's very own best and brightest chocobos will be entering into these races geared specifically to our veteran clientele. What more thrilling way to spend a day at the races than to see Vana'diel's most elite chocobos competing against its most fiendish monsters!?
 9370: First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.
 9371: Next, you must bring me either $0 or $1. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.
 9372: As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.
 9373: Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.
 9374: Since these races are geared towards our more veteran racers and will not make use of jockeys, all in-race conduct is based solely on the chocobos themselves. The CRA wants these races to be as pure as possible!
 9375: The same philosophy applies to the usage of items as well. Simply preset the items you wish for your chocobo to have at its disposal. It will use them as it sees fit based on real-time assessment of racing conditions.
 9376: Many breeders are distressed by these rules, but we assure you there is no need for concern. If your chocobo has progressed far enough in the Chocobo Circuit to even be participating in the Monster Races, it is a given that it has enough know-how to use its items wisely. Have faith in your bird.
 9377: Also, as with other races in the past, you will be able to check on the strengths and weaknesses of your opponents at this service area. Many breeders like to use this information for developing their race strategies, and we encourage you to do the same.
 9378: Depending on your chocobo's performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint chocobucks.
 9379: Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.
 9380: Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.
 9381: There are two main types of races.
 9382: The first type is called an official race. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.
 9383: Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.
 9384: You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.
 9385: However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.
 9386: The second type of race is called a free run. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match. In addition, you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo's performance.
 9387: You are not able to sign up for free runs at this location. To do so, please visit the appropriate service area for beginning and intermediate racers. Thank you for your understanding.
 9388: The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.
 9389: Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.
 9390: Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.
 9391: In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.
 9392: You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.
 9393: Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).
 9394: Your opponents in the official monster races will be any of a host of beasts reared and trained by racing aficionado and announcer extraordinaire, Markovich.
 9395: We ensure all participating breeders that these monsters are in no way enhanced or engineered for racing excellence. The CRA has been adamant about maintaining race participants to as close to their natural state of being as possible.
 9396: Though each variety of monster does in fact possess characteristic abilities and traits. And they have undergone extensive training to optimize their use of these in races.
 9397: As with the chocobos, however, the monsters will be absent jockeys of any kind. It is possible, and expected, that they will often unleash their wild, animalistic instincts on the racetrack. Consider yourself warned.
 9398: In the spirit of drawing crowds, the CRA has also elected to place some of their finest birds on the racing roster as well. Breeders can also expect to see other superior-class chocobos taking part. It's going to take a lot more than just speed and endurance to win these races!
 9399: Finally, in the absence of jockeys, finish-line sensors will be employed. These devices will be attached to the contestants' ankles, or in the absence of ankles, some other such appropriate place.

 9440: The weather forecast for today's race calls for [-/clear skies/cloudy skies/-/a heat wave/-/rain/-/sandstorms/-/wind/-/snow/-/thunderstorms/-/Auroras/-/dark skies/-].
 9441: The current odds are as follows:
 9442: Please select the two chocobos that you think will place first and second.
 9443: [First/Second]:
 9444: Which chocobo would you like to select? [Entry No. 1./Entry No. 2./Entry No. 3./Entry No. 4./Entry No. 5./Entry No. 6./Entry No. 7./Entry No. 8./Quit./Return.]
 9445: I'm sorry, [sir/ma'am], but you have already selected that chocobo.
 9446: You have selected Entries No. $0 and No. $1. This pairing will pay back $2 gil on each quill.
 9447: Proceed? [Yes./No.]
 9448: Your chocobet ticket will cost 100 gil per quill. How many quills would you like to purchase?
 9449: $1 [quill/quills] brings your total to $2 gil. Would you care to proceed?
 9450: Best of luck! Thank you for your patronage.
 9451: Are you having second thoughts?
 9452: Cancel your bet? [Yes, this doesn't feel right.../No, no, no! Let it ride!]

 9455: I'm sorry, [sir/ma'am], but I am currently not accepting chocobets.
 9456: What topic would you like clarification on? [Chocobet tickets./Winnings./Quit./Return.]
 9457: When purchasing a chocobet ticket, you will be asked to place a quinella bet. This means that you will choose the two chocobos that you think will place first and second. If you are lucky enough to win, you may then exchange the ticket and collect your winnings.
 9458: In our current chocobet system, as long as your two picks finish in the top two, the order doesn't matter.
 9459: The size of a chocobet ticket is measured in quills. One quill costs 100 gil, and a single ticket can contain up to 999 quills. Try it once, and you'll get hooked for sure!
 9460: You can stand to make quite a profit if you buy a chocobet ticket and it hits!
 9461: The fewer the bettors who have selected the same chocobos as you, the greater your winnings will be! In the industry, we call those the "odds."
 9462: You can always check the current odds when you place a chocobet. However, the odds are always apt to change right up until the chocobet window closes for that race. So be careful!
 9463: To collect your winnings, simply bring your chocobet ticket back to any of us here at the betting center.
 9464: However, you should know that a winning chocobet ticket is only valid for one week following completion of the race. After that, it will expire, so be sure to cash it in before then!
 9465: Attention, bettors! Only $0 [minute/minutes] remaining to place your chocobets!
 9466: Attention, bettors! Last call! Last call for chocobets!
 9467: I'm sorry, [sir/ma'am], but we are currently not accepting chocobets.
 9468: Bettors may now cash in their chocobet tickets. Please come forward with your winning stubs.
 9469: This chocobet ticket is worth $0 gil. Would you like to cash it in now?
 9470: Collect your winnings? [Yes./No.]
 9471: Very well. Here is your ticket back then, [sir/ma'am]. Next!
 9472: Unfortunately, this is what we call a "losing ticket." More specifically, the chocobos you selected didn't win. Better luck next time!
 9473: The one-week grace period on your chocobet ticket has expired. Regrettably, we are unable to cash you out...
 9474: The outcome of that race is not yet decided. Please come back after the race is finished. Good luck!
 9475: Unfortunately, there was an error in the processing of your chocobet. Please place your bet again.
 9476: Here you can check the latest stats for the next race.
 9477: Preparations for the next race are currently underway. Please wait just a bit longer.
 9478: You wish to inquire as to the status of your chocobet ticket? Very well; one moment, please.

 9480: Would you like me to process your chocobet ticket?

 9629: Now then, the "chocobet center" should be somewhere nearby...
 9630: Hmmm... I must acquire these quaint $0. The question, then, is the pair of numbers. $1-$2 should do the deed...
 9631: A-ahem! Greetings! Would you be so kind as to furnish me with $2 quill[/s] for $0-$1? Thank you, my good sir.
 9632: Now that all formalities are complete, it is time to observe the race.
 9633: Hmmm... Was "ID$3:$0-$1" an unwise decision? No, I have confidence the two creatures will prevail!
 9634: This form of recreation is not held in high esteem in my homeland, and participation has eluded me till this day. While I had knowledge of these races, I never imagined it to be such an exhilarating experience!
 9635: Unleash your fighting spirit!!!
 9636: Perseverance! Perseverance is the key!!!
 9637: Banzaaai!!! I was not mistaken! Why, this is proving to be threateningly addictive!
 9638: Hmmm... This must be the feeling of frustration I had heard about... But... Perseverance! Perseverance is the key!
 9639: Now, where was the chocobet center...?
 9640: Um, okay... I pick... $0-$1! Just look at them, they're so cute and fluffy!
 9641: Excuse me, I'd like $2 quill[/s] for $0-$1, pretty please with sugar on top!
 9642: I better hurry before the race begins!
 9643: I'm cheering for "ID$3:$0-$1"! Why? Because they're so cute, silly!
 9644: Hahaha, is that right? You just can't resist cute things, can you?
 9645: Teehee!
 9646: They're so cute, I wish I could take them home with me!
 9647: Come on, you can do it!!!
 9648: Go, go!!!
 9649: Yaaay!!! See? I knew they could do it!
 9650: Hahaha! You are as wise as you are beautiful!
 9651: Teehee!
 9652: Nooo... They lost...
 9653: Cheer up! You can't expect to win all the time, now.
 9654: Teehee! You're so kind, I like you even more than the chocobos!
 9655: Let's see what is on offer today...
 9656: Hmmm... Very good...
 9657: I shall have $2 quill[/s] for $0-$1. Thank you kindly.
 9658: Not much time left, it seems.
 9659: Yes? Why did I choose "ID$3:$0-$1", you ask? Well...let's just say I have a feeling. <Chuckle>
 9660: Deafeningly loud though this place can be, I oft come here to pass the time.
 9661: Y-yes!!!
 9662: Just a little further!!!
 9663: Huzzah! The old pauper becomes a prince!
 9664: Noooooo! M-my weekly allowance... I must win it back!
 9665: Man, is this place a maze or what!
 9666: Found it! Now, I'm suppose to buy the...uh, $0 here. What's this about picking two numberrrs? You mean, like [1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8]-[1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8]...?
 9667: Then I'll have...[1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8]-[1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8]. What? How many "quills"? Ummm... Just give me $2...
 9668: Talk about confusing!
 9669: Hey, you're supposed to buy these...number things, rrright? I picked "ID$3:$0-$1". Are these supposed to be some kind of code? They're not???
 9670: A beastmaster frrriend of mine told me you can make a killing here... What? I've been played for a fool???
 9671: Hey, what are those chocobos doing over there?
 9672: Huh? They're rrracing???
 9673: Huh? Why do I need to go collect gil from the chocobet center? Oh, I won something!? Whoopeeeeee!
 9674: Huh? You're saying I just threw away all my gil? No no no, this is all wrrrong! I want my money back!
 9675: There's no time to wastaru!
 9676: Now, which two will it be? Considering recent form... Aha! I've got it!
 9677: Hey, gimme $2 quill[/s] for $0-$1. Thanks!
 9678: This is gonna be greataru!
 9679: H-hey, were you eavesdropping? Don't even thinky-wink about bettaruing on "ID$3:$0-$1". You'll reduce my winnings!
 9680: I'm gonna getaru myself $0 when I win!
 9681: Come to daddy!!!
 9682: Gettaru move on!!!
 9683: Whootaru, there it is! I am the champion! No timey-wime for losers! $0 comin' my way!
 9684: <Sniffle...sob...> Th-that's not how it's supposed to end...
 9685: I have to hurry-wurry before betting closes...
 9686: Hrmmm... They all seem sufficiently fastaru.
 9687: Ah! This is it! I can feel it! I'll have $2 quill[/s] for $0-$1. "No guts, no glory," is what I always say.
 9688: Okaaay! Time to find my vantage pointaru!
 9689: I can't explain it, but I have a good feeling aboutaru "ID$3:$0-$1". Call it a "vibe," if you will.
 9690: I've been on a winning streak recently, you see. Could I possibly-wossibly be blessed with...powers?
 9691: Come on!!!
 9692: Go, go, go!!!
 9693: The outcome is exactly as I had feltaru! The vibe never lies!
 9694: Boohoo, how disappointing... I guess the vibes weren't so strong this time. But I'll be back!
 9695: Off I go to the chocobet center.
 9696: Now, let me sneak a peek at the lineup... Hohoho, this will be a breeze! $0-$1 are my picks for the day.
 9697: Hey, you there. $2 quill[/s] for $0-$1, and be quick about it. Gil, you say? You'll have your gil, so just hand me my numbers!
 9698: Now, off I go to watch the race.
 9699: Hmmm? Interested in my numbers, are you? I don't make it a habit to share my picks with people, but just for you: "ID$3:$0-$1".
 9700: As a merchant, my hobby is to observe people where they gather, in order to sharpen my skills in observation. A merchant is nothing without well honed observation skills!
 9701: Oh my Goddess...
 9702: Aaaaaah...
 9703: Hohoho, another fine win indeed! My oh my, how ever will I carry all this extra gil? Off I go to buy myself an extra gil pouch!
 9704: "To err is Hume"... Some folk find that hard to swallow, but it's the reason why life is so interesting, don't you agree? Now, off I go to win back what I just lost!
 9705: Hmph... Of all the race circuits in Vana'diel, why did I have to come all the way here? And where did that pompous old butler run off to!?
 9706: Hmph... What? Gil only? I checked in a whole hoard of gold at reception, so just take what you need from there. Do I have to tell you how to do your job?
 9707: Cash only!? Hmph... Give me $2 quill[/s] for $0-$1. But more importantly, have you seen my butler skulking around here somewhere? No? Hmph... You're as useless as he is.
 9708: Hmph! Now I'm really getting annoyed... Gimaulle! Where are you!?
 9709: Hey, give me some personal space here. I'm not interested in seeing your nose hairs, okay? You just want to know my numbers, huh? "ID$3:$0-$1", satisfied?
 9710: Hmph... That cursed butler even has my gil pouch...
 9711: Oh, a race is about to start!
 9712: <Yawn> Talk about boring. My SilverChariot would blitz the entire field.
 9713: For your information, I'm a chocobo breeder myself. A passing glance is more than enough for me to discern a chocobo's pedigree. Anything less than a winning pick would be an embarrassment.
 9714: Now, for the last blooming time, Gimaulle!!! Where in blazes are you!?
 9715: Hmph! Thanks to my butler's disappearing act, I couldn't concentrate on my picks! Gimaulle!!! You're really going to get it now!
 9716: Milady! To where could she have possibly disappeared?
 9717: Her own SilverChariot is about to take to the field...
 9718: You there, you will give me $2 quill[/s] for all possible pairings with SilverChariot placed first.
 9719: Now, I must needs find milady. Mayhaps she has already proceeded to the spectator stand...
 9720: Hmmm? You wish to know the likely outcome of this race? Why, I would not hesitate to wager my entire fortune on milady's SilverChariot!
 9721: But there are more pressing matters at hand... I am looking for milady, Phemille, whom I accompanied here. Strikingly beautiful, she is, and wise beyond her years. Have you not seen a person who fits this description? Hmmm...
 9722: Aaah, the race has is about to commence! Behold SilverChariot, milady's very own thoroughbred. Not a single chocobo in Vana'diel can rival his magnificence!
 9723: My, my, my...
 9724: Outstanding! This is indeed the fruit of milady's unrelenting devotion, a testament to her gift for chocobo raising.
 9725: Milady never ceases to amaze me. I must needs find her and report the nature of this most delightful victory!
 9726: "A cornered rat will bite," or so the saying goes... Mayhaps it was for the best milady did not witness the race.
 9727: ...
 9728: Hmmm... Nope, none of the others are a match for my MegaFlare.
 9729: 'Scuse me, I'd like $2 quill[/s] for all combos with MegaFlare in first place.
 9730: Cheers.
 9731: What? You wanna know which chocobo's fastest? My MegaFlare, of course!
 9732: I've been puttin' my own chocobo raisin' theory to the test in the real world, and so far I'm undefeated in all official races!
 9733: Go get 'em, boy!!!
 9734: Show 'em whatcha got!!!
 9735: Mwahahaha!!! MegaFlare has once again proven my genius!
 9736: <Sigh> The higher you climb, the steeper it gets, huh? Looks like its back to the drawin' board for me...
 9737: I think it was this way...
 9738: Hellooo! Wow...everyone looks fast.
 9739: Um, I'd like $2 quill[/s] for my LunarHarvester paired with all the otherrrs, please.
 9740: Thanks!
 9741: Hey, you want to know which chocobo is fastest? It's my LunarHarvester! I rrraised her myself!
 9742: LunarHarvester was my grrrandpa's chocobo's chick. That's why she's so fast!
 9743: Oh, the rrrace is about to start!!!
 9744: Go LunarHarvester!!! I know you can do it!!!
 9745: Yay! Yay! LunarHarvester is the best! I have to go tell Grrrandpa!

 9881: With me today is a man who needs absolutely no introduction, Markovich, and our favorite...
 9882: Oh...? Isn't the adorable Sakura with us today?
 9883: I'm afraid Sakura's been rather busy lately and won't be able to join us here at these races. I'll do my best to make up for her absence.
 9884: Is that so...? Things just won't be the same without her lovably abrasive, tongue-in-cheek comments...
 9885: Hmph! Enough of that crying into your microphone. You of all people should know that the show must go on!
 9886: Besides, today we have a very special race in store for our viewers. My very own "baby" will be taking the field!
 9887: Why, I was so looking forward to today's race, I couldn't catch a single wink of sleep last night!
 9888: But of course! I had forgotten all about it! Ladies and gentlemen, have we got a special treat for you! Today's race will see a chocobo and a monster go head-to-head!
 9889: But that's not where it ends! There will be not a single jockey to adulterate this epic battle of bird versus beast! How do you like the sound of that, folks?
 9890: A bold experiment in racing, if I do say so myself. Markovich, how do you foresee the competitors reacting to each other's presence in this most unusual of settings?
 9891: It is my understanding that an especially intelligent chocobo was chosen to partake in this race, so there shouldn't be any worry about it being spooked.
 9892: Moreover, my little fluffykins is as well-bred and well-behaved as your average head of state! But...
 9893: But...?
 9894: I can't say anything for certain heading into this race. After all, nothing like this has ever been attempted in the history of chocobo racing.
 9895: I see... Could that perhaps be the reason why this first-ever experiment has been limited to a one-on-one affair?
 9896: You're certainly on the ball today, Goccilo. Even if the chances are slim, we wouldn't want anything to go awry now, would we?
 9897: But enough talking, I say. It's time to give the viewers what they've come here to see!
 9898: Oh, yes, right... Ladies and gentlemen, sorry for the delay! It is my pleasure to introduce the two plucky participants in this history-making race!
 9899: In the chocobo corner, we have $0, undisputed champion of the official races, and considered by many to be one of the greatest birds ever to grace the Chocobo Circuit.
 9900: Oooh... So this is the much hyped-about chocobo? I wonder if it'll be able to stand up to my Pacey.
 9901: $0's formidable opponent will be Phantom Pacer! Don't let the lamblike good looks fool you, folks. This one truly lives up to the expression, "a wolf in sheep's clothing"!
 9902: I'll have you know that Pacey's appearance isn't just for show. I've survived many a cold winter snuggling up to her fluffy coat. Much better for my aching joints than a crackling fire, I tell you!
 9903: I'm absolutely breathless! That was as hotly contested a race as we have seen in recent years! Any thoughts, Markovich?
 9904: Hrm. This race has proven beyond doubt that "monsters" like my Pacey can race alongside chocobos without any problems whatsoever.
 9905: Indeed! I for one am certainly looking forward to seeing more such races!
 9906: With me today is our regular avian advocate turned adversary, Markovich!
 9907: Whoopee! Bring them on, I say!
 9908: Erm...yes... Now, let's take a look at the courageous contenders in today's race.
 9909: Oooh, so this is the chocobo that's been making headlines. I wonder if it'll be a match for my babies.
 9910: Next, we have the perennial woodenspooner, Keyaki! Despite its dismal track record, its never-say-die attitude has earned the admiration of fans and competitors alike.
 9911: Truly a bird on a mission, Goccilo. I just hope I'll live long enough to see its efforts pay off.
 9912: And with four monsters completing the lineup, I think we can brace ourselves for another encounter of epic proportion!
 9913: My, oh my...! I never imagined commentating would be so enjoyable without Sakura around to--
 9914: A-ahem! I...I mean, um, yes, I believe the race lived up to all expectations. No racing enthusiast could possibly go home disappointed after such an inspirational display.
 9915: All competitors raced gallantly and are deserving of praise, but none more so than the victor...who just happens to be one of my babies! Well done, my pretty! Well done!
 9916: It's unfortunate, though, that race conditions hindered the performance of some of the more promising contenders... <Sniffle>
 9917: Next in the lineup is Sakura. ...!? What on Vana'diel!?
 9918: Hrmmm... Well, they do say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
 9919: Uh, of course, that couldn't have been our Sakura. Though I must admit, for a moment there...I mean, who wouldn't have been shocked to see...
 9920: What are you blabbering on about now? Pull yourself together, man! There are countless race fans waiting to be entertained by our witty commentary!
 9921: Um, yes... Please forgive me...
 9922: And won't you look at the lineup! This time we have a tiger...and even a raptor! Can you believe it, folks? I'm sure glad to be up here and not down on the track alongside the likes of them! Is there no creature they won't bring in!?
 9923: And with me today is our regular guest commentator...
 9924: Huh? Why isn't Markovich here?
 9925: Ohohohohohoho! You seem in a bind, Mister Goccilo.
 9926: <Gulp> You...you're that mage from Windurst...
 9927: ...Professor Shantotto!
 9928: If you're in need of a replacement for Markovich, as a racing connoisseur, I'd be glad to make the switch.
 9929: Furthermore, in a stroke of sheer coincidence, four custom-built Cardians are here in my presence.
 9930: So if you care to hear out my little proposal, these race-ready Cardians are also at your disposal.
 9931: With Markovich and his racing monsters absent, looks like I have no other choice... Will you really help us, Professor Shantotto?
 9932: With which black-hearted biddy do you have me confused? Enough with your doubting, there are competitors waiting to be introduced.
 9933: First up, we have Jack of Trophies, who has been climbing the Cardian ranks at breakneck speed since its upgrade.
 9934: Jack of Trophies' transfiguration was a sight to behold. I just can't wait to see how its story will unfold.
 9935: Next, I introduce to you, Queen of Trophies, who has been the mainstay of Windurst's Cardian force since its inception.
 9936: Queen of Trophies knows not the meaning of the word "failure." Once set on a mission, from that course it will not veer.
 9937: Then we have King of Trophies, whose state-of-the-art leg component is a testament to Windurst's achievements in magical engineering. This experimental Cardian could very well be the future of Cardian technology, folks.
 9938: Even I dare not claim to know of what King of Trophies is capable. If some mishap should occur, be so kind as to not hold me culpable.
 9939: Next we have Ace of Trophies, whose racing prowess is vouched to be in a class of its own. Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen--this Cardian is a championship contender!
 9940: For Ace of Trophies, "championship contender" is an unfitting description. Even "consecutive champion" would not be too high an expectation.
 9941: Um...Professor Shantotto... Shouldn't we be introducing other race participants as well...and not only your Cardians?
 9942: Ohohohohoho! Your impeccable attention to detail pleases me so. But as we lack for time, on to the race, we must go!
 9943: Even these race-bred chocobos shrivel before my Cardian entourage. Compared to the automatons, they're as slow as a splintery river barge.
 9944: Now, I think, we've all had a sufficient preview. So let the race begin, without further ado!
 9945: Ohohohohohoho! Of this inevitable result, I was always assured-- that a Cardian would come away with victory secured!
 9946: The home ground advantage was not in my Cardians' favor. But with some minor adjustments, victory shall be mine to savor.
 9947: H-hey! What do you think you're trying to pull here!?
 9948: My, my, what a pleasant surprise! I'm relieved to see that you are well...and alive.
 9949: How dare you "ohoho" your way into my hard-earned commentary seat! This is a blatant act of...racejacking! You despicable...racejacker!
 9950: Hush now, we mustn't resort to such hurtful vilification. I merely wished to let you take that much-deserved vacation.
 9951: And you, Goccilo! What were you thinking, replacing me with the likes of her!? And don't you think that I don't notice how you slack off when Sakura isn't here!
 9952: Ahem! W-well folks, that's it for another exciting edition of chocobo racing! Until next time...!
 9953: <Player>, I knew you'd make it all the way here.
 9954: What's with the baffled expression? It's me, Sakura.
 9955: You see, I'm actually a full-grown bird. I've been hiding it all this time, using a transformation item to pose as a cuddly chocobo chick.
 9956: I was separated from my mother at a very young age, and have been with Markovich ever since he found me as a stray chick. But all these years, I've never once given up on finding my real mother.
 9957: I have only a few memories left of her--that she was an accomplished racing chocobo...
 9958: And that she quit racing because she felt the circuit was no longer enough of a challenge.
 9959: I thought that if I could get together a strong enough field of competitors, Mother would be enticed to return to the fray. That's why I'm here today--to seek the best racing chocobos to run in the upcoming Dream Race.
 9960: Working in race commentary as a chick, and now running in this race... Everything has been for the purpose of being reunited with Mother. Not even Markovich knows what I've been doing.
 9961: I intend to invite today's victor to participate in the Dream Race.
 9962: I hope that'll be your chocobo, <Player>!
 9963: And next, we have Sakura. But something seems to be different... Ah, her coat is a different color from when she appeared in the Deadly Race.
 9964: She must have obtained feather dye by trading chocobucks. She sure knows how to doll herself up!
 9965: The next competitor is Scorching Needle, a cactuar whose explosive acceleration is second to none.
 9966: I remember the time when it suddenly ran off on me. Boy, did it give me the runaround! A friendly reminder, folks: Be sure to wear gloves when handling cactuar.
 9967: And now, we come to Albinic Amami, a rabbit boasting jaw-dropping vertical jumping power and silken white fur that is irresistible to the touch.
 9968: It trains by jumping back and forth over my head! Gets me rather dizzy after a while, though.
 9969: And that completes the lineup, folks. With such a colorful combination of creatures, I have a feeling this race won't soon be forgotten by the fans!
 9970: You find $0.
 9971: Welcome to the Dream Race, <Player>.
 9972: I've decided to participate in this race as my true self.
 9973: I've always had an inferiority complex about being a different color from other chocobos.
 9974: I wanted to be normal and fit in. That's why I've been dyeing my feathers all these years.
 9975: But no more... If I really want to become champion, I can't continue to avoid coming face to face with my true self.
 9976: This is a lesson I learned from your chocobo.
 9977: I won't hold back in today's race, <Player>.
 9978: Aaah, the chocobo that's been stirring up a storm. I wonder if it has what it takes to go all the way.
 9979: Next in the lineup is the winsome woodenspooner, Keyaki, for whom this will be the first appearance in the Dream Race.
 9980: I never thought I'd live to see the day when Keyaki runs in this race. What is the world coming to?
 9981: Next, we have Sakura...
 9982: Wh-what in the name of the Goddess!? This magnificent white plumage--so pure and beautiful, like freshly fallen snow on the first winter's day!
 9983: Well I'll be... In all my years as zoologist, I have never before laid eyes upon a sight of such splendor!
 9984: ...
 9985: Phew...just getting a hold of myself here, folks. For this race, we will see a return to an all-chocobo affair--the way it's meant to be. What other pleasant surprises can we hope to expect today?
 9986: <Player>, the owner of the winning chocobo, will be awarded $6, $1, and the exalted title of "Chocochampion"!
 9987: Even I couldn't have guessed you'd come this far! Congratulations!
 9988: Great race, <Player>. It's hard to admit, but I was completely outclassed by your chocobo.
 9989: But what's more disappointing is, Mother didn't come.. With so many quality racing chocobos here, I was sure she'd appear, but...
 9990: Princess... Princess Sakura!
 9991: Princess...? What are you talking about? Who are you?
 9992: Please pardon your humble servant this sudden intrusion. I, your loyal handmaid, Keyaki, have been in search of Your Highness for the longest time.
 9993: Searching for...me?
 9994: Yes, Your Highness. You are the crown princess in the land of chocobos. Your snow-white plumage is undeniable proof of your royal lineage.
 9995: Are you serious!? Then doesn't this make my mother the queen!?
 9996: That is correct. Your Highness shares the same beautiful white plumage as Her late Majesty the Queen.
 9997: D-did you just say Her late...Majesty...?
 9998: ...! I-I beg your forgiveness, Your Highness...
 9999: Wh...what happened?
10000: You were but a down-covered chick when the queen departed from this world. You were accompanying Her Majesty on a journey, when a horde of monsters attacked without warning. She protected you from the relentless fiends, but alas, was forced over the cliff face...
10001: She...she gave up her life to save me?
10002: Above all else, Her Majesty was known as a loving mother and dutiful queen. However, being the wide-eyed, innocent chick that you were, you instinctively followed your mother over the cliff, never to be seen again. But, I never once gave up hope...
10003: My search spanned several years and took me to all four corners of Vana'diel. When I learned of the appearance of a new racing chocobo of unrivaled virtuosity, I made haste to the Chocobo Circuit with revived hope. And now...my long search is finally over.
10004: So that's what happened...
10005: Princess Sakura, your loyal subjects eagerly await your return. Let us now return to the land of chocobos!
10006: ...
10007: I'm sorry, but I can't go.
10008: Your Highness! But...why!?
10009: Until the day I triumph over a champion race chocobo like <Player>'s, I won't be worthy to become Queen.
10010: What's more...
10011: I just can't leave poor Markovich here alone by himself. Behind that spirited facade, he really is a lonely old man...
10012: I understand your concerns completely, Your Highness. I shall remain here until you are ready to make your return to the land of chocobos.
10013: What...?
10014: The only place I belong is here, beside you.
10015: And I suppose you won't be taking no for an answer? I'll have you know that there'll be no free-riders here. If you're planning to stay, you're going to have to train your feathers off, is that clear?
10016: I would not have it any other way, Your Highness!
10017: Heehee! Then what are you waiting for? Give me ten laps, on the double!
10018: <Player>, I'm looking forward to our rematch! Until then, don't even think about disappearing anywhere, you hear?
10019: You're still here, eh, <Player>?
10020: Call it fatherly bias, but don't you think Sakura looks stunning in white?
10021: What? How did I know that the full-grown white chocobo was actually Sakura, you ask?
10022: Hohoho... It's not so difficult when you've been a zoologist almost your entire life. Chocobos may age, and their color change, but each will always have their own unique way of walking.
10023: I've also always known that Sakura was searching for her mother. I only wish that I could have done more to help her...
10024: Eh? What's this talk about the land of chocobos? No, I'm afraid I've never heard of such a place before.
10025: Sakura is the queen, you say?
10026: <Chuckle> That girl's just full of surprises. But to fall from grace at such an early age like that... Not a single day goes by without my heart going out to her.
10027: You know what they say: Home is where the heart is. To the racing chocobos, each of the VCS's farms may very well be their own land of chocobos.
10028: And you, our new Chocochampion! Don't forget that this title symbolizes the beginning, and not the end of your journey in chocobo racing.
10029: Always do your best, and never forget those who have helped you get to where you are today. These are the simple wishes of a frail old man.
10030: And they're off!
10031: Hrmmm! [Both/All of the] contestants have gotten off to a great start!
10032: Professor Shantotto, what did you think of the start?
10033: All of the chocobos started well, in my general observance. But faced against my Cardians, that won't make the tiniest difference.
10034: Ah! It looks like one of the contestants was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?
10035: Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the contestants has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?
10036: $0 looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.
10037: The speed of the other contestants has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
10038: The nearby contestants are beginning to look confused! I doubt if they will be able to use any more items!
10039: And yet the other contestants seem completely unaffected by the attack!
10040: It's crowded up front with $0 contestants still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?
10041: It's crowded up front with all $0 contestants still fighting for the lead!
10042: The two contestants are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!
10043: What's this!? $0 has used $1!
10044: $0 still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?
10045: $0 is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?
10046: It doesn't look like anyone will be catching $0 today!
10047: What's this? $0 is making its move on the lead!
10048: $1: $0
10049: What's this!? $0's using [Sheep Charge/Dust Cloud/Healing Breeze/Gloeosuccus/Ram Rage/Sprightly Step/Roar/Repair Wave/Shadow Wave/Slow Wave/Siphon Wave/Wild Carrot/Blaster/Mad Dash]!
10050: Whoooa nellie! Some kind of refreshing breeze has got those [monsters/Cardians] looking light on their feet now!
10051: $0 just went into a fiery rage! You gotta be kidding me! Look at that burst in speed! And fending off attacks from the other chocobos like nobody's business!
10052: I can't quite put my finger on it, but something is different about $0's step. And the attacks of the other participants don't seem to be having any effect!
10053: And here's some unexpected drama, folks! The Cardians are now completely immune to the attacks of the chocobos! How will this play out!?
10054: Look at that! 's stride looks like it has just gotten an injection of added oomph!
10055: Uh-oh, what's going on here!? The chocobos are looking like they had their saddles lined with lead all of a sudden!
10056: Oooh! In a bold move, $0 has just used a [Dream Cracker/Dream Apple]!
10057: What's this!? All of the chocobos other than $0 and Sakura have broken stride and seem to have had the steam taken out of their step!
10058: Thanks to that brazen little act, $0 can expect to maintain endurance, increase speed, and fend off attacks! That just might seal the deal for $0!
10059: Never in all my days, race fans! In a botched attempt to slow down the opposing chocobos, the King of Trophies has just impaired the speed of all the Cardians instead!
10060: How could my creation make such a rookie mistake? In a bout of Cardian disassembly this King shall surely partake!
10061: Shantotto starts casting Tornado!
10062: The speed of the chocobos has dropped!
10063: The stamina of the chocobos has dropped!
10064: The evasion rate of the chocobos has dropped!
10065: Pr-Professor Shantotto, are you out of your mind!? What in the world do you think you're doing!?
10066: Why, my dear Goccilo, we mustn't be so quick to place the blame. This mishap was probably caused by reckless adventurers playing at their game.
10067: What marvels could possibly lie in store for us today? I've heard it being said that today's [creatures/Cardians] have quite the arsenal of abilities at their disposal. This could get heavy, folks!
10068: All of the contestants certainly appear to have quite a bit of steam left in them. Are they holding back? Could they possibly be working in cahoots with one another!?
10069: It seems as though there has been a general quickening of pace amongst the participants!
10070: There's still plenty of race to go, race fans! More than enough time for an awe-inspiring accident or some downright nasty drama!
10071: And it looks as though the contestants have have settled in and found their groove!
10072: The racers look to have gotten themselves into a bit of a rut now. This could make or break the race! Let's see if they can manage to pull through!
10073: This is where it really pays off to have an edge in endurance over your opponent. Let's see if any contestants have the discipline to save some steam for the home stretch!
10074: And here's where we get down to the nitty-gritty! Let's see if some of our racers can provide a flamboyant finish for us here today!
10075: And there they go! A clear boost in speed for the lot of them! But will they have the endurance to maintain their new pace for long?
10076: I am at a loss for words, folks! It's just too hard to call! Which racer will Lady Luck see fit to shine upon today!?
10077: It's painfully obvious that those thoroughbreds have nothing but the finish line in their sights now! The time for a final spurt is now or never!
10078: And here they come down the home stretch! How is this one going to end up!?
10079: Ah, you must be the one they call <Player>. It's an honor to finally make your acquaintance.
10080: My compatriot Joachim has told me much of your exploits. It'd be my pleasure to assist you any way I can.
10081: Good day, <Player>. Is there something you need?
10082: What would like to ask about? [I want $6./Learn about $5./Current $3 stock./Cavernous maw locations./Teleporting to a cavernous maw./Nothing right now.]
10083: All set for now, are we? I'll be right here if ever you have need of me.
10084: Interested in the cavernous maws, are we?
10085: La Theine Plateau, Konschtat Highlands, Tahrongi Canyon...
10086: Jugner Forest, Valkurm Dunes, Buburimu Peninsula...
10087: Xarcabard, North Gustaberg, South Gustaberg...
10088: In these [zero/three/six/nine] areas gateway maws have manifested.
10089: Planning a trip to Abyssea, I gather? You'd be wise to make a habit of taking stock of your $5 prior to departure.
10090: The function of the $3 is twofold.
10091: First and foremost, it's the key by which one gains entry to Abyssea.
10092: Secondly, it serves as an anchor that secures one's essence to foreign dimensions.
10093: A single stone is good for a $1-minute (Earth time) jaunt in Abyssea, and up to $2 can be in your possession at any given time. Multiplying those two numbers will give you the limit of your stay.
10094: One thing to remember is that a good twenty hours (Earth time) are required to fully charge one stone. As such, I might not always have one on hand. I must beg your patience in that case.
10095: Here for your $5? Let me see what I have for you...
10096: Hm? Why, it appears you already have $2 stones. I'm sorry, <Player>, but it'd be irresponsible of me to furnish you with any more. Heavens forbid I have a hand in stranding you in a foreign world.
10097: Oh dear, I'm afraid I don't have any fully charged stones for you right now. Could you check back again in a while?
10098: Here you are, <Player>. That should suffice for the time being.
10099: With the power of cruor, it's possible to teleport to any cavernous maw serving as a gateway to Abyssea. You only need to have visited that maw once before.
10100: If you wish to go somewhere, a quick word with my assistant beside me here and you'll be off to your destination in the blinking of an eye.
10101: It'll take me $4 more [minute/minutes] (Earth time) to fully charge another $3.
10102: You wish to know how many $5 I have for you? Why, that'd be $1 of them.
10103: Obtained key item: $1 $5!
10104: Obtained key item: $1 $3!
10105: I'm sorry, but I don't believe we're acquainted. Please leave me be.
10106: <Sigh>... To see such vistas of peace and prosperity restored to my homeland once more...
10107: Greetings, friend of Abyssea. [/Ivan/Ernst/Kierron/Cyril/Willis/Vincent] is my name. My superior officer [/Gilburt/Erich/Jerrett/Adrian/Fabricius/Fabien] and I have been dispatched here to provide logistical support to allies of our cause.
10108: As you endeavor to restore light to our ravaged world, so too will we endeavor to aid you in every possible way.
10109: How might I assist you this day?
10110: What would you like to ask about? [My current cruor balance./Resistance outpost status./Teleporting to a cavernous maw./Nothing right now.]
10111: The figures in my logbook tell me you have $0 cruor to your name.
10112: Ask about which area? [Abyssea - Vunkerl./Abyssea - Misareaux./Abyssea - Attohwa./Never mind.]
10113: According to the latest intelligence reports...
10114: This area's pulse martello defense rate presently stands at $0%. The likelihood of an Abyssean horde invasion, on the other hand, is $1%.
10115: You wish to teleport to a cavernous maw? In that case, please tell me your precise destination.
10116: Go to which area's gateway? [Abyssea - La Theine./Abyssea - Konschtat./Abyssea - Tahrongi./Abyssea - Vunkerl./Abyssea - Misareaux./Abyssea - Attohwa./Abyssea - Altepa./Abyssea - Uleguerand./Abyssea - Grauberg./I've changed my mind.]
10117: $1 cruor is required for transport to the gateway to Abyssea - [La Theine/Konschtat/Tahrongi/Attohwa/Misareaux/Vunkerl/Altepa/Uleguerand/Grauberg].
10118: Ah, it seems you have insufficient cruor to make that journey.
10119: Will you proceed? (Cruor balance: $2) [Make it so./Make it no.]
10120: These martellos are defensive fortifications developed by the resistance to aid in our battle against the fell hordes. Enchanted structures, they may be employed to restore your health and magic, cure ailments, and generally restore you to fighting trim.
10121: I have been entrusted with the supervision and maintenance of these martellos...but this is none of your concern.
10122: I have been entrusted with the supervision and maintenance of these martellos. Would you be needing something of me?
10123: Need something? [Assist with replenishment./Assist with upgrades./Martellos? Come again?/Nothing in particular.]
10124: Splendid! Your aid is a great boon to the resistance effort. To replenish a martello, you'll need to insert one of these $5 into the structure.
10125: Be forewarned: you will be unable to carry these and $5 at the same time.
10126: Take along the $3? [Yes./No.]
10127: We would be particularly indebted to you for efficient replenishment of martellos in remote locations. Best of luck in your efforts!
10128: Why, is that not $6 already in your posssesion? You need only insert that into a martello to initiate replenishment.
10129: I see that you currently possess $6. Do you wish to abandon your upgrading efforts and participate in replenishment instead?
10130: You return the $3 and obtain $6 in its stead!
10131: Your support is most heartening in these dark times. Upgrading a martello will require you to attach a device known as $6.
10132: Mind you, the device is rather unwieldy. You will not be able to carry it and $6 at the same time.
10133: Excellent. I would be especially appreciative if you could upgrade those martellos in distant locations--the quicker the better. Be careful out there!
10134: Hm? Is that not $6 you hold in your hand? You need only find the martello you wish to upgrade, and attach it.
10135: Is that $6 I see? Do you wish to curtail your replenishment activities and assist with upgrading instead?
10136: Welcome back, friend! Allow me to take that $3 off your hands. How did you fare in your efforts?
10137: I see, I see... Martello #0$1, you say? It sounds as if the operation was [a modest success./a reasonable success./a rousing success!/an unqualified success!]
10138: The resistance greatly values your contributions. Take this as a small token of our appreciation, and do not hesitate to return the next time you are willing to lend your support.
10139: I've been working with these here martellos since I was knee-high. Ask away, and my knowledge is yours.
10140: Ask something? [So, what's a martello?/Martello replenishment./Martello upgrades./Cautionary notes./Not now.]
10141: The device we know as the martello was first developed by military engineers many years past, during an age of great war. Martellos serve to keep combatants fighting fit, healing their wounds and restoring their mental energies.
10142: You will observe that martellos have been constructed in numerous locales, so as to provide strategically located safe havens for harried resistance fighters. No doubt you will find yourself making use of them as well.
10143: In the bowels of each martello is contained a tank designed to hold martello fuel.
10144: This $3 is the lifeblood of the martello, and the source of its curative powers. Depleted stores will render the device little more than an oversized parchmentweight.
10145: That being the case, we're in continual need of volunteers willing to take on the vital task of replenishing these martellos.
10146: I have been charged with overseeing a supply of martello fuel. Should you be willing to take part in a replenishment run, you need only say the word. Needless to say, you will not go unrewarded for your efforts.
10147: Feast your eyes on this $3. She's a beauty, isn't she? Installing one of these into a martello will increase its fuel capacity.
10148: An upgraded martello will be able to sustain its energy stores for a longer time between replenishment operations. Needless to say, this is a blessing and a half to those on the battlefield.
10149: Unfortunately, the installation procedure is quite complex. As such, we can only entrust it to experienced hands.
10150: 5 are quite large and unwieldy. Even the burliest among us would be unable to carry one and $6 at the same time.
10151: Furthermore, these materials are quite unstable, and will rapidly corrode and be rendered useless if brought outside our immediate environs.
10152: 'Course, not that anyone could manage to travel that far, what with these fearsome landslides...
10153: Warning: Changing areas, logging out, or becoming disconnected will cause all data pertinent to this quest to be reset.
10154: Your $3 has been lost.
10155: The resistance is currently suffering a materials shortage. Those wishing to participating in replenishment and upgrading operations should return at a later time.
10156: The $3 breaks!
10157: Table: $0
10158: Very well, friend. Should you ever find yourself in need of assistance, do not hesitate to return.
10159: Greetings, friend! I am a synergy engineer, dispatched from the Institute to maintain the furnaces you see beside me. I also have knowledge and services to share with fellow synergists, if that is what you desire.
10160: I see from the puzzled expression on your face that you are unfamiliar with our discipline. To use these furnaces, you will first need to obtain $6.
10161: Piqued your curiosity, have I? Then you should speak with Hildolf, our institute director, at his laboratory in the Bastok Metalworks. He's always eager to welcome a new synergist to our ranks.
10162: May I be of service? [Not now./Learn recipes./Check fewell./Replenish fewell./Purchase materials./Receive training./Trade cinder./Get information.]
10163: Recipes, you say? Let's see what we have that's suitable for your level of expertise...
10164: ...I'm sorry. I'm afraid there's nothing I can teach you at the moment.
10165: I've got it! How about $0? Mind you, it'll require a certain level of skill...
10166: Synergy skill: [Amateur/Recruit/Initiate/Novice/Apprentice/Journeyman/Craftsman/Artisan/Adept/Veteran].

10184: There you go. That doesn't sound so hard, now, does it?
10185: But of course! If you'll just allow me to inspect your $3 for a moment...
10186: Your fewell supply would appear to be as follows: o o $1 o!$2 o"$3 o#$4 o$$5 o%$6 o&$7.
10187: Running low? We can fill you up for a nominal fee.
10188: Replenish fewell? [Yes./No.]
10189: Looking for a fewell fill-up, you say? Then you've come to the right place!
10190: ...Hm? Why, your tank is already full to bursting. Come back again if you need a refill.
10191: Now let's see here... According to my calculations, I can fill you up to capacity for $0 gil. How does that sound?
10192: Pay $0 gil? [Deal!/No thanks.]
10193: Understood. Take care to monitor your reserves closely, lest you run out of fewell in the midst of a crucial procedure.
10194: I'm afraid you haven't the requisite gil, friend. Perhaps another time.
10195: Excellent! Now we just pop open your $3 here, and...
10196: There you go. Filled to the brim with a fresh batch of fewell! Can you smell those fumes? Mmm-mmm!
10197: Your $3 has been filled to capacity!
10198: You hand the synergy engineer $0 gil.
10199: How do you expect me to do that when your $3 is sitting inside a furnace, friend? You'll have to come back after you've finished synergizing.
10200: Materials, you say? But of course! Have a look at our selection.
10201: Purchase something? [Not today./$1 $0 : $2 gil./$3 $0 : $4 gil./$5 $0 : $6 gil.]
10202: For $1 $0 , that comes to $2 gil.
10203: Ah, another dedicated synergist looking to refine [his/her] technique. Excellent! That motivation will serve you well.
10204: ...But I'm afraid you'll need [/ever so slightly more/a bit more/more/a good deal more/considerably more] experience before you're ready to benefit from my training.
10205: And yes, it would seem you're at just the right skill level to receive my training. So, what will it be? Which technique would you like to improve?
10206: Train in which technique? [Cancel./Fewell feeding. (Current Lv.: $0)/Furnace thwacking. (Current Lv.: $1)/Pressure handle. (Current Lv.: $2)/Safety lever. (Current Lv.: $3)/Furnace repair. (Current Lv.: $4)/Fewell recycling. (Current Lv.: $5)]
10207: You wish to improve your [/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique. Is this correct?
10208: It would seem your [/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique already exceeds my own. There is no more I can teach you.
10209: Train in this technique? [Yes./No.]
10210: Very well! Now listen up, watch closely, and try to follow along...
10211: ...See, you take this part here, and... Yes, yes...just like that...
10212: ...Now steady here, or you'll be picking exploded furnace shrapnel out of your face for a week! Phew, that was a close one...
10213: ...And by applying Corollary Five of Hildolf's Third Theory of Inverse Transfocal Equilibrium, we find that...
10214: <Clink, clank...clunk> ...Er, let's try that once more...
10215: ...Superb! A quick learner, I see. If only all my students were as attentive as you!
10216: Your [/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique increases to level $1!
10217: Research into the composition of the cinder produced as a side effect of synergy just might lead to the next breakthrough in our field. Provide us with samples for analysis, and we will gladly reward your contributions.
10218: Trade in your cinder? (Currently: $0 Pz) [Not now./$1: $2 Pz./$3: $4 Pz./$5: $6 Pz./$7: $8 Pz./$9: $10 Pz./$11: $12 Pz./$13: $14 Pz./$15 gil: $16 Pz.]
10219: This is what you want, correct?
10220: Make the exchange? [Yes./No.]
10221: It would appear that you lack the necessary quantity of cinder for that transaction.
10222: Excellent! And this is yours. May it serve you well!
10223: You transferred $0 Pz of cinder to the synergy engineer. $1 Pz [remains/remain] in your possession.
10224: Ask about what? [Nothing./Synergy furnaces./Synergy overview./Synergy procedure./Synergy recipes./Fewell replenishment./Materials for sale./Synergy techniques./Trading cinder.]
10225: The synergy furnaces you see around town are provided as a public service by the Bastokan Institute of Synergy Research, to ensure that no synergist is ever far away from the tools of their trade.
10226: The synergist must provide his or her own $3, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process. Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.
10227: Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.
10228: Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town. If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.
10229: You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis. It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.
10230: Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results. The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.
10231: This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call "fewell." To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!
10232: As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require. Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.
10233: With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing! Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.
10234: The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be. In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!
10235: But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.
10236: If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.
10237: Take heart, though, as any materials inside your $3 will remain intact. You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.
10238: Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.
10239: Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.
10240: Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions. Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!
10241: You may be asking yourself, "Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?"
10242: Here's the good news: you don't have to! For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.
10243: The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand. At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.
10244: Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of $0, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.
10245: Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that $0 may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.
10246: Mind you, $0 is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it. Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.
10247: Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped. May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!
10248: First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply. You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.
10249: You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe. Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.
10250: Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy. If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.
10251: You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically. Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.
10252: From here, it becomes a race against the clock! Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.
10253: Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task. First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.
10254: Next, you can begin to feed fewell into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration. Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.
10255: However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions. Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.
10256: If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you'll want to employ the safety lever and pressure handle to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.
10257: You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition. Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.
10258: The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues. You'll need to perform periodic furnace repair should the furnace near its breaking point.
10259: It is also possible to recycle strewn fewell during synergy. While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.
10260: This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute. As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.
10261: As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable. There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.
10262: For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger. Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!
10263: You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.
10264: In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well. To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.
10265: Now let us return to the synergy process itself. As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.
10266: If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance. The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.
10267: Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills! Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...
10268: What's an elemental surge, you ask? Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.
10269: The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?
10270: ...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell. There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.
10271: Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe. We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.
10272: Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients. There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.
10273: Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.
10274: The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own. The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.
10275: In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as $0 can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.
10276: # cannot be attached directly. First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of $0 can then be embedded.
10277: The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment. There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.
10278: If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.
10279: As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.
10280: You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures. It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.
10281: Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant. Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.
10282: My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale. The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!
10283: The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.
10284: Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach. Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.
10285: To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.
10286: When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.
10287: Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call revertant.
10288: Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state! Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.
10289: As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call "fewell." The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.
10290: Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.
10291: To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!
10292: For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.
10293: That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your $3! What could be easier?
10294: Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of $0? If so, you've come to the right place!
10295: We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as mordant for sale. With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.
10296: Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff. You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.
10297: Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant. As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.
10298: Ah, synergy techniques! Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.
10299: My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques. We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.
10300: Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge. For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.
10301: Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents. You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.
10302: Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer. These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.
10303: The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills. To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.
10304: Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.
10305: Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation. Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.
10306: We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.
10307: It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold! Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.
10308: Wondering if your $0 can be outfitted with evolith, are you? Well, you've come to the right place!
10309: A quick look at its composition should tell us all we need to know. Let's see here...
10310: Congratulations! Your $0 can indeed hold [an/another] evolith aperture. A $2-shaped aperture, to be exact...
10311: ...Suitable for evolith of the following size and elemental affinity: Maximum size: $1 / [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&].
10312: ...Suitable for evolith of the following sizes and elemental affinities: Maximum size: $1 / Affinity: [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&]. Maximum size: $3 / Affinity: [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&].
10313: ...Suitable for evolith of the following sizes and elemental affinities: Maximum size: $1 / Affinity: [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&]. Maximum size: $3 / Affinity: [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&]. Maximum size: $5 / Affinity: [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&].
10314: ...Suitable for evolith of the following sizes and elemental affinities: Maximum size: $1 / Affinity: [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&]. Maximum size: $3 / Affinity: [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&]. Maximum size: $5 / Affinity: [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&]. Maximum size: $7 / Affinity: [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&].
10315: That is all. Should you wish to have any other pieces of equipment analyzed, you know where to find us.
10316: Hmm... I'm afraid your $0 cannot house any more apertures.
10317: ...Alas. It's a shame, but it appears your $0 cannot be etched.
10318: Hmm, what's this? It would seem that your $0 cannot be etched at this time.
10319: Do you love synergizing as much as I love synergizing!? 'Cause if you do, you're gonna loooooove the recipes I have for you!

10323: Oh, the $0? Why, that's one of my favorite recipes, too! What skills does it require? Let's see here...
10324: Well, look at this. All you need is a furnace and your own Goddess-given synergy skills to make that one! Ain't synergy grand?
10325: Wait! No, don't tell me. You strike me as a [man/woman] who's looking to learn a thing or two about synergy.
10326: Learn about synergy? [Not today./Teach me!/Just give me $6.]
10327: A life without intellectual curiosity is a life hardly worth living. Should your eyes one day open to this truth, you are free to return.
10328: I thought you'd never ask! Synergy is both an art and a science: an evolution--nay, a revolution--in synthesis.
10329: Using $6 in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.
10330: What we call $6 serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.
10331: Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists. The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.
10332: Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your $3 into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.
10333: Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.
10334: Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium. The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.
10335: You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.
10336: But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.
10337: A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.
10338: That's why smart synergists synergize in numbers. Too many culinarians might spoil the broth, but when it comes to synergy, it's the more the merrier!
10339: An aspiring synergist, I see! If you're looking for $6, you've certainly come to the right place.
10340: I can sell you a splendid entry-level model for $0 gil. A small price to pay to embark on a lifelong journey of scientific discovery, wouldn't you say?
10341: $0 gil, paid in full!
10342: As promised, here's your $3. And because I like your enthusiasm, I've even stocked it to the brim with fewell for you! How's that for a deal?
10343: The synergist must provide his or her own $3, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process. Synergy furnaces themselves may be used free of charge.

10381: Mandragora Mania is a game in which you battle for jingly by moving your mandragora pieces to the goal.
10382: Your goal is the [red/blue/green] one on the right, while your opponent's is the [blue/green/red] one on the left.
10383: At the start of the game, three mandragoras each will be placed on the eight game areas, excluding the goal.
10384: There are five starting placements (A through E), and you are able to select which one you would like to employ. The default setting is "Random."
10385: This explanation uses pattern A, but the basic rules are the same regardless of the starting pattern.
10386: The three [red/blue/green] areas in front of you are yours,the three [blue/green/red] areas at the back are your opponent's,and the remaining two are neutral.
10387: You must choose one area--either yours or a neutral one--to proceed.
10388: The areas are numbered from one to five starting from the left, and any mandragoras in the area you select will move.
10389: Conversely, your opponent must select either a neutral area or an area that belongs to them.
10390: From the right, those areas are numbered 6, 4, 7, 2, and 8.
10391: For example, if you select Area 1,one mandragora will move to Area 2and one will move to Area 3,and one will move to Area 4.
10392: Note that the mandragoras will move from the back first--last in, first out.
10393: You will receive points known as "jingly" each time one of your mandragoras reaches the goal.
10394: You will enter your opponent's territory whenever you go past the goal.
10395: If one of your mandragoras happens to reach the opponent's goal, the goal will be pushed back and your mandragora will return to your own area. You don't have to worry about your mandragora earning any jingly for your opponent.
10396: The order in which players choose areas will be determined based on your turn settings. The default setting is random.
10397: This explanation has skipped past your opponent's turn for demonstration purposes, but in the actual game you and your opponent will take turns choosing areas.
10398: However, if the last mandragora to move reaches the goal, you will get to take an additional turn.
10399: Mandragoras are a very diverse species, and the amount of jingly you earn is determined by the species of mandragora that crosses into the goal.
10400: Adenium and citrullus: 3 jingly (first player)/4 jingly (second player).
10401: Korrigan and pachypodium: 2 jingly (first player)/3 jingly (second player).
10402: Standard mandragoras: 1 jingly (both players).
10403: The game is over when either you or your opponent no longer has any mandragoras that can move.
10404: The player who has the most jingly at that point will be declared the winner.
10405: The key to victory lies in taking advantage of the various mandragora subspecies bonuses while claiming multiple turns in a row.
