## String References

- **14041**: [Mister/Miss] Adventurer! [Mister/Miss] Adventurer! A quicky-wick word, if you please?
- **14042**: I'm the lovely Wetata, dispatched straight from the Jeuno Institutaru of Magical Studies!
- **14043**: Have you heard of Jeuno? It's a city far to the northwestaru that connects Mindartia and Quon.
- **14044**: My magnificentaru powers of observation tell me that you are [a fledgling/an accomplished/a world-famous] adventurer! Am I right?
- **14045**: Have I got some lovely-wovely news for you, then! At a recent international meeting, my institute released information on a brand-new type of magic that we've developed!
- **14046**: [I see you've already heard-weard, but let me review the details./Let me filly-will you in on the details.]
- **14047**: It's a kind of super summoning-wummoning magic that knocks the socks off even the most tight-laced Manustery mage!
- **14048**: One of my fabulous superiors--not as fabulous-wabulous as me, of course--has directed me to make this magic available to explorers of all shapes and sizes.
- **14049**: So I'd like to experimentaru on you...
- **14050**: Err...
- **14051**: With you! Experimentaru with you! Oh dear, that didn't come out right, either. But I know you're just itching to give it a shot, aren't you?
- **14052**: Experiment with the new magic? [Why not?/Sorry. Not my thing.]
- **14053**: Oh deary-wear. I didn't think it was possible, but I may have screwed that one up.
- **14054**: I love your positive energy! This will be absolutaruly delightful!
- **14055**: Windurstians have always been receptive to new ideas and ways of doing things. That's why I'm so excitarued to put my many talents to use here!
- **14056**: I guess the institute has some of my colleagues posted in San d'Oria and Bastok looking for subjectarus, too, but their small victories will surely pale in comparison to my series of conquestarus!
- **14057**: Oh no, I've done it again...
- **14058**: My charming smile may have lured you in, but the endless possibilities of participating here in Windurst surely have you rivetarued! What do you say?
- **14059**: Who would adventure-wenture alone when you can enlist the aid of a powerful white mage?
- **14060**: Participate in Windurst? [Yes./No.]
- **14061**: Ugh! Who would want to make the trekky-wek all the way to Bastok or San d'Oria when they've got an adorable little figure right in front of them? I think it's in your best interest to reconsider.
- **14062**: Excellentaru! I knew I could turn that frown upside down!
- **14063**: See this pristine-wistine piece of paper? Take it with you and head for Heavens Tower.
- **14064**: Not only am I irresistible, but I'm also good with directions-wections! Just head north from here to Windurst Walls, look for the big tree, and follow the path there!
- **14065**: You're looking for a foul-mouthed Tarutaru named Kupipi. She might have a bit of a hot streak, but she'll be able to provide you with an explanation-wation almost as stupendous as my own!
- **14066**: Phew! Is it just me, or is it stuffy out here? Hmm? You want to learn more about Trustaru?
- **14067**: Inquire about what? [What Trust is./What happens when one uses Trust./How to learn new Trust spells./Whereabouts of Trust participants./Nothing at the moment.]
- **14068**: Trust is a new type of magic inventarued by the Jeuno Institute for Magical Studies and unveiled at our recent international symposium.
- **14069**: As any Aurastery student could tell you, most magic taps into the aetheric energies of the caster, draining them. "Trust," however, relies on the spiritual energy which develops between two souls bound closely by love and friendship.
- **14070**: That means you can use it regardless of your job-wob! Isn't that almost as fantastic as my hairstyle?
- **14071**: There's one small caveataru--you should never use this magic within city walls. Regulations and all.
- **14072**: Using Trust magic brings out an alter ego of someone who you have a special-wecial relationship with.
- **14073**: However, no matter how powerful-wowerful your friends are, when you call forth their alter ego, it will only be as strong as you.
- **14074**: You must surely be fascinated with all this, thanks to my clear-cut explanation. You want to know what's even more fascinating? That the alter ego will fightaru alongside you!
- **14075**: Of course, you won't be able to give the alter ego you summon specific instructions-wuctions. This is your friend we're talking about; you don't go barking orders at friends, right?
- **14076**: So if the alter ego you summon runs off and gets into trouble, don't get too mad, okay?
- **14077**: To send alter egos back from whence they came, simply tell them so. They'll probably be happy to take a little break-weak.
- **14078**: If its life force runs out, it will retreataru into the aether and vanish from this realm. But fear not--you'll be able to call it back into our world after a certain amount of time has passed.
- **14079**: Trust magic is based in the emotions of trustaru, friendship, and [brotherly/sisterly] love, so you can't summon just anyone. Take me, for example--I'm far too adorable and busy for you to call forth whenever you want.
- **14080**: But there are others willing to help you. Those participating in the Trust initiative may be able to help you if you take the time to chataru with them.
- **14081**: The strength of the bonds you have with them--if any--determine if the magic-wagic will succeed or fail.
- **14082**: If it fails, then you may need to adventure more and make a name for yourself, as I have. Or maybe you need to help solve some problem-woblem they have. It depends!
- **14083**: [And let me fill you in on a little secretaru/Let me fill you in on a little secretaru]. <Whisper> There may be a way to summon an alter ego if you've never even met the person!
- **14084**: Ahem! You may come across a strange scroll that will let you do this. Bring it to me and I shall use my expert knowledge to assist you in this endeavor-weavor.
- **14085**: I shall allow you to take but a sip-wip from my vast well of knowledge. Let's see...
- **14086**: [Excenmille/Naji/Kupipi/Curilla/Ayame/Nanaa Mihgo/Trion/Volker/Ajido-Marujido/Iron Eater/Prishe/Ulmia/Shikaree Z/Cherukiki/Gadalar/Zazarg/Nashmeira/Gessho/Ingrid/Maat/Arciela/Chacharoon] can be found-wound in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Tavnazia/Aht Urhgan/Adoulin/the Mog Gardens].
- **14087**: My fountain-wountain has...run dry!? That can't be right. Maybe I need to wait for another shower of information.
- **14088**: Oooh, you found-wound $3! Why, you're almost as good at this as I am!
- **14089**: Did you know that the person mentioned here is also a participant in the Trustaru initiative?
- **14090**: All the stuffiest scholars in the institutaru have burned the midnight oil poring over the towering volumes of data our participants have gathered.
- **14091**: Ah, the Trustaru initiative has progressed by leaps and bounds over the past several months!
- **14092**: You and that person must have something truly special-wecial going on between you.
- **14093**: F-forgive me for looking a bit flushed. It's just that breakthroughs like these don't come-wome every day!
- **14094**: Oooh, would you look at... ...Waitaru a second. Just who is that?
- **14095**: The flow of information coming from the headquarters has slowed to a trickle lately. How am I supposed to use this $3 in conditions like these!?
- **14096**: Wh-what!? How on Vana'diel did you get your hands-wands on this $3?
- **14097**: This puts me in a bit of a pickle-wickle, but if it's a real cipher, then we've got to try it.
- **14098**: Wh-what have you done to this cipher-wipher? It's mystically stuck together!
- **14099**: Still, I'd hold on to it. Maybe we can figure-wigure something out later.
- **14100**: You cannot read this cipher due to an event occurring in Rhapsodies of Vana'diel.
- **14101**: Huh? Just who on Vana'diel is this supposed to be? Well, here goes-woes...
- **14102**: A strange illusion, you say?
- **14103**: That's the funny thing about magic-wagic. You never know what you're going to get.
- **14104**: You may be shocked-wocked to learn that our experimentation with Trust has expanded beyond the five races!
- **14105**: "Speed it along"? Grrr... Normally I hate being rush-wushed, but I suppose you're entitled to your due.
- **14106**: I'll skip the long explanation for now. Close your eyes, and pictaru yourself crawling under the warm, comforting blanketaru of friendship...
- **14107**: Spectacular!
- **14108**: I had my doubtarus, but you really did it! I certainly taught you well, didn't I?
- **14109**: You already know about Trustaru? You mean...one of my colleagues in another nation told you?
- **14110**: I doubt their explanations were as thorough as mine would have been, but no matter. Will you be participataruing here in Windurst?
- **14111**: Ah, you found-wound $3! Why, very impressive indeed!
- **14112**: You see, Doctaru Monberaux's services are in high demand, meaning he is unable to leave Jeuno. So he said he wants his alter ego to travel-wavel and see the world.
- **14113**: However, during our little talk, I feltaru an icy and jealous stare upon me. I wonder who that was...
- **14114**: Could it have been Wolf... Well, I suppose it doesn't really matter-watter.
- **14115**: Enough about that. Close your eyes, and pictaru yourself crawling under the warm, comforting blanketaru of friendship...
- **14116**: Spectacular!
- **14117**: I had my doubtarus, but you really did it! Best of luck on your future adventures!
