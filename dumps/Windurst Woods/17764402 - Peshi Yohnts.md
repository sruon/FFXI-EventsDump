- **7446**: Now tell me...what's a Quaddle again?
- **7447**: .........
- **7448**: A turtle? Well, why didn't you say so!? I know exactly what you need! I'll work on a rrrough plan while you go out and find $0 and $1.
- **7449**: And my fee? I couldn't think of taking money from my closest, [handsomest/cutest], most bestest frrriend, <Player>! (Even though the guild is in debt for 98,000,000 gil...)
- **7450**: Pay 98,000,000 gil? [Why not? I'm loaded!/Not in 98 million years.]
- **7451**: Okay, okay. I don't want to put you in debt or anything. How about $2 gil? That shouldn't set you back too much, should it? Alrrright! Now let's get to it!
- **7452**: Hey everrrybody! <Player>'s here...again! As much as I'd love to hand over the plans to your turtle disguise, I'm going to need just a little more time! Oh, and don't forget the $0, the $1, and the $2 gil I asked forrr!

- **7462**: ...for the low, low price of $1 gil! I'll even give you a thrrree-year guarantee! What do you say!? Do we have a deal!?
- **7463**: Pay the $1 gil? [Yes./No way!]
- **7464**: Grrreat! Hey everybody, listen up! Now we can afford that icebox for our pamama au lait! Oh, <Player>, were you still there? Come back in a couple days for your parts...and an icy-cold drrrink!
- **7465**: Hey everrrybody! <Player>'s here...again... (I thought I told you that it would take a couple of days. Now get the hell out of my face!) Alrrright! We'll see you later! Have a great day!
- **7466**: Yeah! You can turn that frrrown upside down! The parts for your disguise are rrready to go!
- **7467**: Now, all that's left is piecing the puzzle together! I'll give you the list of ingredients you'll need, so go grrrab a quill and parchment! Are you rrready? Here we go...! One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight!
- **7468**: One! $1! Two! $2! Three! $3! Four! $4! Five! $5! Six! $6!
- **7469**: Seven! $7! Eight! Another $7! Use $0, and mix 'em all arrround. That's what it's all about!
- **7470**: You've got the boneworking skills. I know you can do it! (Just don't forget to polish your clothcrrraft and leatherworking skills...)
- **7471**: Hey everrrybody, can we get three cheers for our favorite [guy/lady]? Hip hip hooray! Hip hip hooray! Hip hip hooray! Hip hip...wait, that'd be four cheers...
- **7472**: Now all you have to do is piece them together! You didn't think I'd do all the work, did you? I don't even know what one of those Quaduffs looks like!
- **7473**: Hm... But by the looks of it, you might not exactly have what it takes to put that disguise togetherrr...
- **7474**: I've got it! Hey everrrybody, listen up. I have a super-duper idea!
- **7475**: There are a lot of my energetic students out there that would be morrre than happy to whip together that costume of yours. Why don't you go out and find one of them!
- **7476**: Here, let me fill you in on what he'll need! Are you rrready? Here we go...! One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight!
- **7477**: All of my pupils are grrreat, but this project is a doozy! Make sure the superrr trooperrr you find is at least an adept.
- **7478**: Also make sure that he has dabbled in a little weaving and leathercrrrafting as well!
- **7479**: Oh, and when he's done with your costume, make sure that you tell him "good job," and give him a big hug. (And maybe fork over a few gil for his trouble.) See you around, <Player>! And have a wonderful day! Yeah!
- **7482**: Well, if it isn't [a veteran/an expert/an authority/a luminary/a master] of our rrranks. Let me guess: you're looking to smash through the barrier and take your bonecrafting skills to the next level. Am I right?
- **7483**: Am I right? [You betcha!/Not exactly.]
- **7484**: Now, that's a rrright answer if I ever heard one. Here's what you can do: first, trrrack down Samigo-Pormigo and get yourself a copy of $6.
- **7485**: You'll be needing some guild points for the transaction. Just consider it a warrrm-up for the greater task at hand.
- **7486**: Then what're you wasting my time for? Be on your way, and don't rrreturn until you're ready to show some commitment to our craft.
- **7487**: First, you'll want to trrrack down Samigo-Pormigo and get yourself a copy of $6.
- **7488**: Now here's a [man/woman] who's read $6 from cover to cover. I'm right, arrren't I?
- **7489**: No need for further delays then. Whip me up $2, and let's make it spiffy. The materials you'll need are...
- **7490**: And not like you need a rrreminder, but be sure to sign your work. Otherwise, how will we know it's you who made it, and not some clever impostor?
- **7491**: You forgot the ingrrredients for $2 already? Seems like someone needs to work on [his/her] memory as much as [his/her] bonecrafting skills. You'll be needing...
- **7492**: Terrrific work, <Player>! If there was anyone worrrthy of the title of expert rank, it's you! With you in our ranks, our wares are sure to fetch a fortune!
- **7493**: This is unacceptable, [Mister/Miss]...oh, what was your name again? I seem to have forgotten, just as you've forgotten to sign your work!
- **7494**: As you rise through the ranks, it's even more crucial that you show proper respect for guild prrrotocol. Now get back out there, and do try to follow instrrructions this time.
- **7495**: Look, everrrybody, <Player> is back! Isn't that exciting? And it looks like you're rrready to tackle $0!
- **7496**: Bring one to me and I'll make you [an artisan/an adept/a veteran]!
- **7497**: Now, I know you're all rrrevved up about this project, but I have to let you know--become [an artisan/an adept/a veteran] and you'll be one of us.
- **7498**: You can always become [an artisan/an adept/a veteran] in another guild, but your ability may fade. We wouldn't want that now, would we? Anyway, do your best!
- **7499**: Oh, and if you're looking to achieve [arrrtisan/adept/veterrran] status in another guild, keep in mind that doing so will take its toll on your bonecrafting prrrowess.
- **7500**: Hold it rrright there, <Player>! What's this about you becoming [an artisan/an adept/a veteran] in another guild?
- **7501**: At this rate, you'll never rrreach your true potential as a boneworker. Talk about a downer!
- **7502**: But here's the brrright side! It isn't too late to revoke your [artisan/adept/veteran] rank with those other guys and come back to the fold.
- **7503**: What's more, you don't even have to worry about facing any scary guildmasterrrs. Just gimme the good word and I'll take care of everything! So, what'll it be?
- **7504**: Boo! Boo on you, <Player>! And here I thought you were something special when you made [arrrtisan/adept/veterrran]!
- **7505**: One, two, three, four--out the door! I've got real boneworkers who deserrrve my attention more than some dabbling dilettante.
- **11875**: Ask if this person is the chick's owner? [Yes./No.]
- **11912**: You've rrreally got my chocobo?
- **11913**: Terrrific! Ever since the little bird flew the coop, I haven't been able to concentrate on my work at all. I was afraid I'd never get out of that rrrut.
- **11914**: Let me tell you a nice story to show you just how thankful I am...
- **11930**: Sorry, but you've got the wrong gal. I'd never be able to work this well if my prrrecious chocobo was missing!
- **14881**: You can increase Craftsmanship by crafting items that match up with your skill while you have the $0 equipped.
- **14882**: Craftsmanship will increase greatly when you fulfill certain conditions, but crafting the same item over and over again will reduce your gains, so try synthesizing something different if you run into trouble.
- **14883**: In its default state, the shield has the unfortunate tendency to lower the success rate of your crafting, but as its Craftsmanship rises, it mitigates that effect.
- **14884**: You can tell the Craftsmanship rating as well as the crafting success rate by looking at the shield. Good luck to you. Mwahaha...
- **14985**: Oh, it's you again. What's the storrry behind that shield?
- **14986**: Hmm... I see you've spoken with her. Like me, you're quite currrious about things.
- **14987**: According to her, that shield can boost one's crafting ability. If it's true, that's quite an incrrredible feat.
- **14988**: That's the shield, yes? I have the recipe, so I suppose I could do it if I had the time... I'm really busy, you see.
- **14989**: I know... She gave you the shield, yes? You're quite skilled at our crrraft, so how about you give it a try? Yes, it's settled then!
- **14990**: Listen up now. I'm going to teach you the rrrecipe, so pay attention.
- **14991**: So, firrrst, you'll need $1 to get started.
- **14992**: Its purrrpose is to boost the Craftsmanship of the $0 to its full value.
- **14993**: Wait a moment. I have some notes on Craftsmanship that you should hear, so listen carrrefully.
- **14994**: Did you catch all of that?
- **14995**: Come see me when you've incrrreased the Craftsmanship rating. I'll make you the $1 that you require.
- **14996**: Next on your list are $2 and $3. You can get them by speaking to Tergil.
- **14997**: I imagine you've made deliveries for people, yes? This is basically the same idea.
- **14998**: You can speak to Tergil for furrrther details.
- **14999**: That's it for the ingredients. Come show me the shield after it's been upgraded. I'm currrious to see it for myself.
- **15000**: Hm? You forrrgot the recipe already? Okay, here's the list again. Remember, skilled craftsmen only need to hear this once.
- **15001**: You've managed to match even my skill as a craftsman. I'm prrretty confident that you can make this shield.
- **15002**: Yes, very well done indeed! With this, I can make the $0 no prrroblem.
- **15003**: So, this is the $0.
- **15004**: The technique to imbue a craftsman's soul into the shield to form a crystal... It makes no sense to me, but I can definitely feel its power.
- **15005**: Hmm... It appears that by creating the $0, it also reduced the Craftsmanship of the $1.
- **15006**: That's fine if you only need to upgrade the $1, but you'll have to raise the Craftsmanship if you want to make another $0.
- **15007**: Of course, it's not like you'd ever need to do such a thing. Not someone as rrresponsible as you.
- **15008**: I don't believe it... You'rrre telling me that you lost the $0?
- **15009**: Oh well. These things happen I guess. Let me see the shield. I'll crrraft you another $0.
- **15010**: You're an elite craftsman now. You need to take better care of your ingrrredients or you'll never get any work.
- **15011**: It seems you made the upgrrrade. Here, let me see how you did.
- **15012**: Hmm... I can see the differrrence and feel its power, but it's clearly not finished yet.
- **15013**: I'm sure she's already told you that you'll need to craft multiple times in order to achieve the expected rrresults.
- **15014**: Oh yes... You need proof that the shield is complete. Wait just a moment and I'll get that rrready for you.
- **15015**: That should do it.
- **15016**: Simply show this shield to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno and you'rrre all set.
- **15017**: Oh, one more thing. I often have deliveries for Tergil. I hope you'll agrrree to help me train the newer guild members.
- **15018**: Hello therrre. Yes, I've been expecting you after speaking with you know who.
- **15019**: This is the recipe you'll need. Do try to rrremember it, will you?
- **15020**: I hope you didn't forrrget that already.
- **15021**: Now, let's discuss how to obtain the ingredients. Firrrst, you'll need to start with the $1.
- **15022**: You used this before, no? Like with the aspis, you'll need to crrraft while equipping the $0 in order to boost the shield's Craftsmanship.
- **15023**: This time, though, you'll need to put in a little more effort.
- **15024**: Once you have increased the Craftsmanship to its maximum level, come see me and I'll crrreate the $1 for you.
- **15025**: Next, you need $2 and $3. Do you remember the $3 frrrom before? I've given both of them to Tergil.
- **15026**: Last is the $4. With the help of the A.M.A.N., I've prrrepared some Records of Eminence objectives for you.
- **15027**: You can rrrefer to the Records of Eminence menu for more details. Once you've cleared them all, you'll get the $4.
- **15028**: That's it. I know it's harrrd work gathering all of these ingredients, but you've been through worse, no? I know you'll be fine!
- **15029**: Oh, it seems the shield's Craftsmanship has drrropped.
- **15030**: Wait just a moment. I'll have the $0 for you beforrre long.
- **15031**: Ahh, it turned out just perrrfectly.
- **15032**: Ahh... It looks like crrreating the $0 has once again caused the shield's Craftsmanship to drop.
- **15033**: It is no easy task to increase its Craftsmanship, so keep it in a safe place until you're rrready to use it, understood?
- **15034**: Hah... Something about this shield is quite fascinating. Did you use $0 or something?
- **15035**: Yes, I can sense the power of this new shield. It feels rrremarkably different from the previous one.
- **15036**: Here, allow me to marrrk it for when you show it to her.
- **15037**: Therrre you go. Take this shield to Mewk Chorosap to complete your task.
- **15038**: This simply will not do. You'rrre going to need to face the final objective once again.
- **15039**: You've done well. Now, let's go over the next rrrecipe.
- **15040**: What's this? You alrrready know the recipe and how to obtain some of the ingredients? Well, this should go quickly then.
- **15041**: That just leaves the $4 and $5. Very well then.
- **15042**: We have some customers coming to orrrder items from us, so I'm going to have you make the items near them and make the delivery.
- **15043**: It seems many of our customers are quite knowledgeable about boneworking, so they want to see our craftsmen's work up close and perrrsonal.
- **15044**: As such, only items made in front of the customer will be accepted, although there are some exceptions to this rrrule.
- **15045**: Forrrgive me, but you'll need to gather the necessary materials to create the item yourself. Fortunately, it doesn't matter how you get them.
- **15046**: By the way, we've reached an agrrreement with the other guilds to buy and sell items that aren't normally available, assuming you have the money.
- **15047**: You can see the items available in this area by speaking to each guild's crafting set vendor. I suppose it'll prrrove quite useful for you.
- **15048**: Although, note that each guild is free to set its own rrrules, so you may not always be able to get what you want.
- **15049**: Once you complete all of the customer requests, I'll give you the $4 and $5 as prrromised. Good luck out there.
- **15050**: This is the [first/next/last] request.
- **15051**: Make a deliverrry of $1 $0 to Silver Owl at the Tenshodo in $7.
- **15052**: Deliver $1 $0 to Crooked Arrow in $7. You can find him in frrront of the Auction House.
- **15053**: Make a deliverrry of $1 $0 to Silver Owl at the Tenshodo in $7.
- **15054**: Make a deliverrry of $1 $0 to Pawkrix at Muckvix's Junk Shop in $7.
- **15055**: Oh, this is an item that doesn't need to be crrrafted near the customer.
- **15056**: Don't forrrget to report back to me once you finish the request.
- **15057**: The current request you're worrrking on is...
- **15058**: How is the request coming along? Everything is going accorrrding to schedule?
- **15059**: Everything okay? [Everything's great!/It could be better...]
- **15060**: I know I can always count on you. Keep up the good work!
- **15061**: Hm? What's the matter?! You don't sound very well at all... Are you surrre you're feeling okay? Do you want to give up?
- **15062**: Will you see this through? [I'll do my best./I've had enough.]
- **15063**: I see... I guess you have been working prrretty hard recently. Very well. I'll ask another craftsman to help me.
- **15064**: Try not to push yourself too harrrd. Take a rest for now and I'll have another customer for you when you're ready.
- **15065**: Hello. You look like you're feeling better. Indeed, you're not nearrrly as pale as you were before! Okay, let's get down to business, shall we?
- **15066**: Ahh, it seems you've finished the deliverrry to our customer. Nice work!
- **15067**: Yes, I see you've completed the final deliverrry. I knew I could count on you to get it done.
- **15068**: Alright, here are the $0 and $1, just like I promised.
- **15069**: While I'm sure you'd never lose something so prrrecious, you can use guild points to obtain them again if need be.
- **15070**: I really have come to like this kind of work. It's quite rewarding to see your efforts come to frrruition.
- **15071**: Look! The shield is complete!
- **15072**: Yes, it really does have a nice feel to it! Your skill as a craftsman continues to grrrow without bounds!
- **15073**: Accorrrding to her, the next upgrade should unlock the true power of the shield. I can't wait to see what it becomes!
- **15074**: Oh, I almost forrrgot! I was thinking you could make use of this new crafting technique. Consider it my little gift to you. I hope you can get some use out of it.
- **15075**: Hello there. I see you've rrreached the final upgrade!
- **15076**: You will need to ask about the rrrecipe. All I can tell you is how to obtain the necessary materials.
- **15077**: Let's see... First, you'll rrrequire $2 and $3...
- **15078**: I've left them with my frrriend Tergil. You just need to exchange crafter points for them.
- **15079**: Next is the $1... I can produce it for you once your shield's Craftsmanship rrreaches 100%. Just like before, basically.
- **15080**: That about covers the explanation. This being the final upgrade and all, I expected it to be more difficult, but it sounds prrretty much the same. Hopefully, there's nothing to trip you up out there.
- **15081**: I believe Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno needs this. Be carrreful not to lose it on the way.
- **15082**: Hello. Hm? What's wrrrong?
- **15083**: I see... Yes, I rrreceived the order. I was told to put my very heart and soul into it, so I remember it clearly.
- **15084**: Although, I just sent it off to Jeuno. I never hearrrd that you'd be by to pick it up. If only you'd told me sooner...
- **15085**: Well, I'm sure it's already arrived by now. You should rrreturn to Jeuno and see if it's been delivered. It was addressed to Mewk Chorosap.
- **15086**: Hey, you didn't happen to bring this from Jeuno, did you? This emblem that I worrrked so hard to make...
- **15087**: Hm? You've been searching for this? I wonder how it got here... Perrrhaps it was a ghost? Here, hurry up and get it away from me.
- **15088**: Wait a moment! This must be it! Let me examine it...
- **15089**: I see... I see... This is quite impressive! Just when did you manage to learrrn such skill?
- **15090**: Actually, now that I think about it... You walking around with this thing is the perrrfect way to spread the word about our guild!
- **15091**: I'm glad you showed me this. Here, I have something for you. It will teach you a brrrand new crafting technique.
- **15092**: Your growth rrreally is quite impressive. If I'm not careful, you're likely to replace me as guildmaster before I know it!
