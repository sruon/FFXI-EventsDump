## String References

- **12027**: Greetings. I am a journeyman trainer from the VCS, and I have been sent to this town to promote knowledge exchange between chocobo owners.
- **12028**: We believe that the best way to promote interaction between owners is through interaction between chocobos.
- **12029**: And after countless VCS conferences, we recently agreed on the establishment of a new program--
- **12030**: Kamp Kweh!
- **12031**: Breeders need only possess a chocobo to join. Please speak with me again if you are interested.
- **12032**: I can answer your questions regarding Kamp Kweh?
- **12033**: What would you like to know? [What exactly is Kamp Kweh?/How do I sign up?/Are there any restrictions?/Nothing at all.]
- **12034**: Kamp Kweh is a place where fellow breeders can bring their chocobos to interact with each other.
- **12035**: At the camp, owners can check the status of their companions' animals...
- **12036**: ...as well as confirm breeding compatibility.
- **12037**: However, please note that any results from these tests are merely estimates, and may not fully reflect the actual condition of an animal.
- **12038**: Our wish is that through the various camp activities we offer, your chocobo will have the opportunity to improve its skills.
- **12039**: Only adventurers who are currently raising a chocobo can participate.
- **12040**: Owners can enroll their animals once they have hatched.
- **12041**: To begin, adventurers should first form a party of those who wish to participate, and then come talk to me or any of the other VCS journeyman trainers stationed throughout Vana'diel.
- **12042**: Please note that only up to six chocobos can attend the camp at one time, so do not come as an alliance.
- **12043**: We refuse admission to the following:
- **12044**: 1. Any owners who have not checked up on their chocobos recently. Those who feel that they may have been neglecting their animal may want to visit the stables before attempting to participate.
- **12045**: 2. Chocobos who are sleeping or have run away.
- **12046**: 3. Chocobos who have yet to be named.
- **12047**: 4. Party members who are too far away from the stables.
