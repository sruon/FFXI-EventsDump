## String References

- **10553**: The mandragora flutters about in consternation.
- **10555**: Babban Ny Mheillea looks fondly in your direction.
- **10557**: Nice to meet you, my [kinda/really] tall friend! I'm Babban Ny Mheillea!
- **10558**: Oh, <Player>! I'm so glad to see you!
- **10559**: You must be really special to be able to change forms like that! But I could tell who you were right away!
- **10560**: My friends and I are playing a fun game called "sunshine seeker," where we search for shards of sunlight!
- **10561**: Just give them a little squeeze and you'll see how warm and bright they are!
- **10562**: But my friends're so much better than I am...
- **10563**: Maybe you could lend me a hand! Yours're much bigger than mine!
- **10564**: Lend Babban a hand? [I'll lend you two!/I'm a bit busy right now.]
- **10565**: Aww... Hopefully you'll change your mind. I'll be waiting here!
- **10566**: Hooray! Maybe I'll finally be able to win!
- **10567**: I'll give you some small seeds in exchange for the shards of sunlight you bring back.
- **10568**: Even better! I've got some special things available for you to buy with your seeds!
- **10569**: But here's the best part--If you try your luck with my grab bag enough times, you might win something really super!
- **10570**: One of the rules of the game is that you must be a mandragora, like me, or else you won't be able to collect any shards.
- **10571**: They can be found all around here. But if you don't hurry, someone else might gobble them up.
- **10572**: But once you've taken them from one place, you can't get any more from there by searching it repeatedly!
- **10573**: Shards of sunlight are really delicate, so they'll disappear if you leave this area or take too much time getting them back to me.
- **10574**: My friends'll also try to get in your way, so be sure not to get noticed!
- **10575**: I can fly you right to the starting point. Just say the word!
- **10576**: Ready for mischief? [The sun will bow before me!/The light...it burns us!]
- **10577**: Nononono, sunlight is your friend! Come back once you've decided to help me hunt!
- **10578**: Good luck! Collect as many as you can and bring them back to me!
- **10579**: Why, hello!
- **10580**: Inquire about what? [I want to play the game./I'm ready to turn in my shards./I want to exchange small seeds./Let me try the grab bag./How many seeds do I have?/I'd like the items you're holding for me./Dispose of what you're holding for me./Tell me how the game works./No questions for now.]
- **10581**: You look like you'll be able to try for even harder things in this game!
- **10582**: My friends'll try to get in your way even more. Are you sure you're ready?
- **10583**: Wow! I'll bet you're ready for the championship round!
- **10584**: My friends'll surely never let you get away now! Sure you want to try anyway?
- **10585**: Oh no...you mean you didn't find even one single shard? That's terrible...
- **10586**: I'll be waiting for you to play our game again!
- **10587**: You did such a lovely job! You brought me $0 shard[/s] of sunlight, so I'll give you $1 small seed[/s]!
- **10588**: I can give you so many pretty gifts in exchange for your small seeds!
- **10589**: Which would you like?
- **10592**: I've prepared a little grab bag you can enjoy for some small seeds.
- **10593**: Which would you like to try?
- **10594**: Pick your poison. ($30 seed[/s]) [The $0-seed grab bag./The $1-seed grab bag./The $2-seed grab bag./No poison, thanks.]
- **10595**: That grab bag contains prizes like $0, $1, and $2.
- **10596**: Press your luck? [C'mon, no whammies.../Not right now.]
- **10597**: You won $0! Congratulations!
- **10598**: ...But your bags are full! What do you want me to do with it?
- **10599**: What will you do with the $0? [Have Babban hold it./I don't want it.]
- **10600**: I'll make sure to keep it really safe! Come back when you've made room!
- **10601**: Then...you won't mind if I have it!
- **10602**: You have a total of $0 small seed[/s].
