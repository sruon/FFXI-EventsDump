 6749: Accept this mission? [Yes./No.]
 6750: You have accepted the mission.
 6751: (DEBUG) Flag raised, kupo!
 6752: Welcome, Master! This is your home, the "Mog House," kupo!
 6753: I'm a moogle! We moogles like taking care of houses and items! Nice to meet you, kupo!
 6754: I'll tell you all about your Mog House, kupo!
 6755: First, the basics, kupo! Open your main menu, Master. The button at the very bottom changes to "Mog House" when you're in your Mog House, kupo!
 6756: Press it and the "Mog House" menu will appear! Everything you can do in your Mog House is there, kupo!
 6757: There are lots of things you can do in your Mog House, kupo! It can be too much for some masters, kupo...
 6758: So I'll teach you about each one of them! Ask me what you want to know about, kupo!
 6759: Choose the Mog House command you want to know about, kupo!
 6760: What do you want to know about? [The Mog Safe./Storage./The Delivery Box./Changing jobs./Gardening./Changing the layout./Mog House invitations./I got it, thanks, kupo!]
 6761: The Mog Safe is where I keep items that you can't carry! It's an especially secure and solid safe, kupo!
 6762: You can only put so many items in it, kupo... But I'll guard them even if it means my life, kupo!
 6763: The Delivery Box is where you can send letters to friends and receive items from various places, kupo!
 6764: You should take the items from your Delivery Box and put them in your inventory when they arrive, kupo!
 6765: If your Delivery Box is full, no more deliveries can be made, and you can't send any mail either, kupo!
 6766: You can send items and gil to your friends with the "Send" command, kupo!
 6767: (Sometimes, if a special force takes hold, you can even deliver items with the "Exclusive" attribute, kupo...!)
 6768: Changing people's jobs is a secret ability only we moogles can use, kupo!
 6769: I take off all your equipment and take you to a mysterious place, kupo!
 6770: And...the rest is a secret, kupo!
 6771: All moogles like taking care of plants, kupo!
 6772: As long as you have a flowerpot and seeds, I'll make it my personal responsibility to look after the plants you raise, kupo!
 6773: This Mog House is your very own room, kupo! But it's still a little bare, kupo...
 6774: It needs some furniture and maybe some paintings to make it more cozy, kupo!
 6775: If you find any during your travels, I'll help you lay them out, kupo! I can't wait, kupo!
 6776: Storage space becomes available when you place furniture in your Mog House using the "Layout" command, kupo!
 6777: It's almost exactly the same as using your Mog Safe, kupo! Leave your items here for me to look after, kupo!
 6778: You can invite party and alliance members into your Mog House, kupo!
 6779: You can show off your expensive furniture, have tea parties, plan your next great adventure--the possibilities are endless, kupo!
 6780: Are you sure, kupo? You know everything about your Mog House, kupo?
 6781: Are you sure? [I'm sure!/Maybe I'm not so sure...]
 6782: And finally, a little bit of advice!
 6783: If you ever run into any problems, just ask your fellow adventurers for help!
 6784: If you type "/ae Hello!", then your message will be heard by many people.
 6785: If you type "/ae" followed by your issue or question, other adventurers will help you!
 6786: Remember that you can only do this while in town, kupo!
 6787: Okay, kupo! Good luck on your adventuring, kupo!
 6788: Do you want me to teach you about your Mog House again, kupo?
 6789: Ask about your Mog House again? [Don't ask./Ask.]
 6790: Over the mountains and the rolling hills, I'll go wherever my master wills.t
 6791: Master! I traveled all the way here at your bidding, kupo! Even a Rent-a-Room needs a moogle, kupo!
 6792: But there are a few things you can't do in a Rent-a-Room, kupo. Select "Mog House" from the main menu and check, kupo!
 6793: When you go back home, talk to the guard in front of the residential area to call me back to the Mog House, kupo!
 6794: Master! I have something to tell you, kupo!
 6795: I found this precious item under the $3 pillow, kupo!
 6796: It's all yours, kupo!
 6797: I used the $3 to write a song for you, kupo!
 6798: Here, kupo! Please think of the lonely moogle waiting for you back home when you hear this song, kupo!
 6799: I found this item in the back of one of the $3's drawers, kupo!
 6800: It's all yours, kupo!
 6801: I found this in the back of the $3, kupo!
 6802: It must be a gift from the heavens, kupo! Here, take it, kupo!
 6803: I found this item inside the $3, kupo!
 6804: Luck is on your side, kupo! Take it, kupo!
 6805: I fished this item out of the $3, kupo!
 6806: It was very hard work, kupo... I'm very tired, kupo...
 6807: I found this behind the $3 painting, kupo!
 6808: This must be what they mean when they say, there are many mysteries behind works of art, kupo! It's all yours, kupo!
 6809: Something clattered inside the $3 when I shook it! Look what fell out when I turned it upside down, kupo!
 6810: It's all yours, kupo!
 6811: I felt there was something strange about the $3, and when I looked into it, I found this, kupo!
 6812: We moogles have very good intuition, kupo! It's all yours, kupo!
 6813: Oh, Master! You won't believe what I found out on the doorstep this morning, kupo!
 6814: At once so glorious and so ghastly, and just for you! Think of it as a holiday gift from a humble moogle to his favorite (and only) master, kupo!
 6815: For your own safety, it is recommended you set the Mog House exit as your home point after changing jobs.
 6816: Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with [overwhelming/powerful/faint] [fire/ice/wind/earth/lightning/water/light/dark] energy, kupo!
 6817: Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with [the overwhelming/the powerful/the faint] energy of many different elements, kupo!
 6818: Each item of furniture you place using the "Layout" command corresponds to a different element, kupo! The type of energy that envelops your Mog House changes depending on those elements, kupo!
 6819: When that energy changes, my powers change as well, kupo! Master, you should try placing all sorts of furniture in your Mog House, kupo!
 6820:

 6823: mes9
 6824: TEST-No.$1
 6825: I found $6 inside the $3, kupo!
 6826: Kupo...? I sense that this $3 is very, very special! You should go to the store where you bought it and ask about it, kupo!
 6827: Master! Master! Look what I found underneath the $3 this morning, kupo!
 6828: It has been wrapped and everything! I wonder who it could be from, kupo!
 6829: Look what I found in your $3!
 6830: You seem quite dehydrated lately, so maybe you should have it. I'll try putting some more grapes in the barrel and see if I can make any more, kupo!
 6831: Your Mog Locker lease is valid until // ::, kupo.
 6832: The lease on your Mog Locker has expired, kupo. Please trade $0 to me or to Fubruhn in Aht Urhgan Whitegate.
 6833: Your Mog Locker lease has been extended until // ::, kupo!
 6834: Master, Master! I found this in the $3, kupo!
 6835: It must be a present from the smilebringers. Here, you should have it, kupo!
 6836: If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a woman named Alaune. She's at the Westgate in Southern San d'Oria, kupo.
 6837: If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a man named Gulldago. He's at the West Gate in Bastok Markets, kupo.
 6838: If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a woman named Selele. She's at Leviathan's Gate in Windurst Woods, kupo.
 6839: Master! What [an egg-ceptional specimen/egg-ceptional specimens] you have there! Now, if you'll just let me have a look-see, kupo...
 6840: We egg-tach this thingamajig to that thingamabob, just like so, kupo...
 6841: Now for the coup d'egg-grace...!
 6842: Voila! Isn't she a beauty, kupo? Utterly egg-squisite workmanship, I do degg-clare!
 6843: We egg-stract this doodad from that doohickey, just like so, kupo...
 6844: Voila! Your original egg-redients, entirely egg-tact, kupo! If you change your mind, just trade them back to me or one of my moogle egg-sociates!
 6845: Oh, Master, look at this! I was poking around in the drawers of your $3, when this $4 just popped out! I guess you never know what you're going to find until you look for it, kupo!
 6846: Isn't the aroma positively scrumptious? It's all yours, kupo! Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!
 6847: Here, I want you to have it. In fact, I insist, kupo! Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!
 6848: Look at what I found while cleaning out the $3: $4!
 6849: Here, I want you to have it. In fact, I insist, kupo! Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!
 6850: $3{$3^$3$97F$31V$P10i]\7
 6851: It all began with a raindrop, or so the legend says...
 6852: Master! Oh, master, look! We've sprung a leak, kupo! Just look at it drip, drip, dripping away!
 6853: What a terribly troubling turn of events, kupo! But have no fear! Sit tight and you'll see why I'm the most renowned handymoogle in the three nations!
 6854: Goddess have mercy on my moogle soul. Look at this mess! Rotting roof boards! Rusted nails, kupo!
 6855: Why, it's a miracle this tottering, tumble-down shanty--I mean, this beautiful abode of yours--is still standing, master!
 6856: Anyhow, this simply won't do, kupo. We must make repairs before we have water up to my little wings!
 6857: I figure all I'll need is a good $0, $1, and $2 to have this fixed up good as new, kupo!
 6858: Could I trouble you to track them down? While you're out, I'll patch up the other problem spots.
 6859: And do hurry, Master! Lest you return to find your poor moogle friend lying prostrate in a pernicious puddle of rainwater, kupo...
 6860: Thank you, Master, but our leak is in another Mog House! Bring this to me when we're back home in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst], won't you, kupo?
 6861: You've found them, kupo! I knew I could count on you. That's what I tell all my moogle buddies. "Why, my master is the boldest, brightest, bestest master of them all!" Now we just take these, and...
 6862: Kupoooooo`there you have it! Better than new! Why, a bevy of wild buffalo could barge in here this second and it wouldn't budge an ilm, I say!
 6863: Which reminds me, I went ahead and relayed the requisite reports to my manager at the MHMU.
 6864: But wouldn't you know it, kupo? It seems there's been a trifling bit of trouble at one of our Rent-a-Rooms in Jeuno as well!
 6865: You know the one, right across from Durable Shields. Whatever could have gone wrong, kupo?
 6866: Well, there's nothing to be learned lollygagging around here. Come, Master, we're off to Jeuno!
 6867: Little did anyone suspect that this would prove to be only the beginning of a harrowing nightmare unheard of in the annals of mooglekind...
 6868: Do something? [Read instructions./Change parameters./Teleport to key locations./Warp to home point./Receive items./Obtain 100,000,000 gil./Do nothing.]
 6869: Hail, adventurer! I am the most mighty of moogles, my miraculous magicks able to alter all manner of arcane attributes!
 6870: But be forewarned, kupo! Once modified by moogle magick, your parameters cannot be restored to their prior state!
 6871: Furthermore, you may trade a moogle storage slip to me to wipe it clean, or mystically entrust its entire contents to me. Quite convenient, wouldn't you say?
 6872: Adjust parameters? [Edit main job level./Reset ability recast timer./Obtain merit points./Receive all spells/rolls/attachments./Unlock all jobs and support jobs./Cancel.]

 6911: Hang on! I have an amazing announcement!
 6912: The hallowed halls of your house are even more exciting! Why? Because now there's a second floor, kupo!
 6913: But before you bash your way in, I've got a trifling task for you to tackle.
 6914: Capricious Mithra cubs have cajoled critical information out of the M.H.M.U., and I want you to wrest it from them!
 6915: Visit the three nations and question them, kupo!
 6916: Now you know the nitty-gritty, so enjoy your new floor, kupo!
 6917: Kupopo? You mean you already know?
 6918: Magnificent and marvelous! Then proceed without delay!
 6919: Enjoy extra space to store your sundries!
 6920: Remodel your room to fit your finicky tastes!
 6921: Incorporate ostentatious overseas objects! All this and more!
 6922: But only on the second floor, kupo. I like the first floor as it is.
 6923: And as for your potted plants--they only persevere on the ground, kupo.
 6924: And moghancement effects only activate for furnishings fitted to the first floor.
 6925: Wish we could help more, but we spend enormous amounts of energy on one floor already!
 6926: Go forth and frolic in your new abode, kupo!
 6927: You can access the antechambers from the front door. Enjoy!
 6928: $3 might bring a certain je ne sais quoi to your Mog House, kupo!
 6929: Ah, I never thought that this day would come, kupo...
 6930: Indeed, it seems like just yesterday that we first met here.
 6931: I have watched with wonder as you grew before my very eyes, kupo.
 6932: In fact, I heard many tales of your boundless bravery from my friends across the world.
 6933: Every time, it made me feel much like a proud parent would.
 6934: It was like I was right there with you, kupo.
 6935: That is why I ceaselessly cleaned your Mog House, merrily managed your belongings, and watered your plants.
 6936: I couldn't really think of any other ways to help you, kupo.
 6937: However, I heard about the trials and tribulations that you've been through.
 6938: Valhalla, the Maelstrom Mage, Chaos...
 6939: Kupopopo! Now I can actually assist you!
 6940: It is time for us to joyfully join forces, kupo!
 6941: We can discuss details at the stone circle in the La Theine Plateau! I'll be waiting for you there, kupo!
 6942: You go on ahead, and we'll see each other soon!
 6943: Hey therrre, [mister/miss]! Have you heard? Have you?
 6944: Well, have you? [What are you talking about?/Yes, I have!]
 6945: Reooow. Well, I guess I don't have to tell you, then.
 6946: Do you rrreally wanna know? Really? Really? Listen! I know the secrets of gar-den-ing.
 6947: What do you wanna know? What do you wanna know?
 6948: What do you want to know? [What is gardening?/What do I need to start?/How do I garden?/Are there any limits?/Bye-bye!]
 6949: Meowww...
 6950: Take a seed, plant it in a flowerpot, and leave the rest to your moogle! That's garrrdening!
 6951: Then, after a while, a prrretty flower blooms!
 6952: And then, and then the flower turrrns into fruit, and you can get all kinds of neat stuff!
 6953: % stares off into the distance.
 6954: Oops! I was just thinking about all that delicious fruit. Purrrrrr...
 6955: Um, okay, to start off, you're gonna need a flowerrrpot and some seeds.
 6956: You can buy flowerrrpots in town, but you're gonna have to go out and get your seeds from plant-monsterrrs.
 6957: And then guess what! Guess! Guess!
 6958: Give your plant a crrrystal and its frrruit will change! Really!
 6959: % stares off into the distance.
 6960: Oh! I was just thinking about all the different kinds of fruit and... Purrrrrr...
 6961: You can sit back, relax and do all your garrrdening in your Mog House!t
 6962: All you have to do is tell him what to do, and your moogle will do all the worrrk!t

 7210: This is Windurst's North Auction House. We can deliver your belongings to your home, or help you send presents to anyone in Vana'diel.
 7211: Our prices are most reasonable. There's no greater joy than the joy of giving, so ask one of my pretty little assistants to arrange your deliveries.
 7212: We are the local courier-wouriers. We deliver the goods that people leave with the girly-wirlies over therey-wherey.
 7213: If you wantaru participate in the auction, then step rightaru up to the counters lining the wall over there.
 7214: We deliver goody-woodies to your home, or the home of one of your friendy-wiendies!
 7215: I can arrangey delivery of your belongings to your Mog Housey or Rent-a-Roomy for you.
 7216: Did you hear? Did you hear? The auctioneer over there--one of his deliverymen was attacked by a monster! What terribliociousness!
 7217: Gee... An auction courier is a pretty dangerous job! It seems that every day you hear of another deliveryman getting attacked by some wild beasty-weasty or crazy customer.
 7218: This is the North Auction House. We would like to transport your belongings to your home, or help you send presents to people...but...we're having problems delivering on that promise.
 7219: Alas... A terrible occurrence has befallen us.
 7220: You see, the other day, one of my deliverymen was attacked by a monster. And...we seem to have lost several of the letters he was carrying.
 7221: If I don't do something to retrieve the mail and deliver it to its rightful owners, the reliable name of my courier service will be ruined! Dear adventurer, would you be so kind as to help us find our lost mail?
 7222: Help find missing mail? [Yes./No.]
 7223: I see... Guess I'll have to ask someone else. Oh, where's a decent adventurer when you need one!?
 7224: Thank you! Thank you! Our deliveryman was ambushed where the Tahrongi Canyon meets East Sarutabaruta.
 7225: So if you can search high and low in both the Tahrongi Canyon and Sarutabaruta, hopefully you'll be able to find all the pieces of mail that were lost.
 7226: Please bring me back whatever you can find! Through rain and shine, monsters and beastmen, the mail must get through!
 7227: Seems that all of our deliverymen let down their guard when crossing between the Tahrongi Canyon and East Sarutabaruta. They must think they can outrun the monsters there or something.
 7228: Anyway, even if you find a single missing item of mail, please bring it back to me. Through rain and shine, monsters and beastmen, the mail must get through!
 7229: The last time something like this happened, it was the Savanna Rarabs that made off with most of our maily-waily. Seems they think they can make a comfy-womfy nest out of our letters.
 7230: Look outaru for those Savanna Dhalmels. They just love to eataru our mail!
 7231: Thank you! Thank you! It's a miracle that even one of these letters came back to us safely. I had almost given up on the thought of seeing these ever again!
 7232: It's only a little, but please take it as a reward. We'll make sure that this mail gets delivered to the right person this time. Don't you worry about that!
 7233: Thank you! Thank you! You found $1 pieces of mail! I'm so glad to see these come back to me safely.
 7234: It's not much, but please accept this as a reward. We'll make sure that this mail gets delivered to the right person this time. Don't you worry about that!
 7235: Oh, thank you! Thank you! I can't believe you found four missing pieces of mail at once. Most delightful. Most delightful. Now this might not be much, but please accept it as a reward...
 7236: I can't wait to tell the deliveryman who was assaulted by those monsters that you found four pieces of mail! I'm sure the news will help speed up his recovery!
 7237: If you find any other missing pieces of mail, make sure you bring them to me. I'll do my best to make sure it's worth your while!
 7238: Oh, what's this? What's this? You've gone and found some more of my missing mail! Thank you! Thank you! Please accept this as your reward...
 7239: Oh, what's this? What's this? I can't believe you found four more missing pieces of mail. How splendid! Thank you! Oh, thank you! Here, please accept this as your well-earned reward...
 7240: Wait till the deliveryman who was assaulted by those monsters hears that you found four more pieces of mail! I'm sure the news will help speed up his recovery!
 7241: That we can now live here in peace...under the blessed shadow of the Great Star Tree...is all thanks to the great hero, Karaha-Baruha...!
 7242: Let the name of the great hero, Karaha-Baruha, not be forgotten! May we exalt the name of Karaha-Baruha on high!
 7243: Just in front of the bridge over to Heavens Tower, there's an old man who is always giving public speeches. I'm surprised he doesn't get ill from standing outside and talking from that rock, day in day out. How devotionilicious he is!
 7244: Gee... I sure would like to meety-weety that summoner who appears in all the tales of twenty years ago. They say he was one of the great genius-weniuses who only appear once every several hundred years.
 7245: Ha-hummm...we...arrrk...owe...our... <Cough>...peace...Hrmmm... A-hrmmm! <Cough> A-hrr-hrr-hrr-hrrmmm...!
 7246: Ha-hrr-hrr-hrrmmm...! A-hrr-hrr-hrr-hrr-hurrummm...!?
 7247: Oh, crumbs! The great, old teacher has lost his voice before he could deliver his famous public speech!
 7248: Are you all right, sir? Don't try and force yourself to continue. It might make your throat worse!
 7249: Oh, goodness-gracious me... I thought his audience's reaction was livelier than usual, but it seems that the old public speaker has gone and lost his voice.
 7250: Let me see... I guess this will have to make do. I was hoping to save it to make a nice drink out of, but that can wait. Here, give the old gent this and see if it helps...
 7251: If he swallows some of that honey, honey, it should fix his sore throat right up. Why, that's honey from the bees out in Sarutabaruta you're dealing with here!
 7252: Ack...<cough!?> What's... A-hrmmm! this...? A-hrr-hrr-hrr-hrrmmm...!
 7253: Mister speaker! Please lap up as much of that honey as you can so it fixes your throat up! Then you can tell us more about the great summoner!
 7254: Hey, did that honey help you to talk a little just now? Then it must be effective. Quick, bring him as much honey as we can find!
 7255: A-ha! Ha-hrrmmm... That's a... A-hrr-hrrmmm little better...A-hrr-hrr-hurrummm. Quick! <Cough> Need more honey! A-hrr-hrr-hrr-hrrmmm!
 7256: A-hrrmmm. Feels like it's getting a lot better! But there's still some irritation... A-hrr-hrr-hrr-hrrmmm. See! <Hack>
 7257: Oh......
 7258: He's gone silent all of a sudden! What's wrong, oh great teacher?
 7259: Maybe...? Maybe his throat is completely cured!? Wow. Now, can you continue with your stories, sir?
 7260: ......
 7261: My...tooth...
 7262: ...hurths...!
 7263: Your tooth...?
 7264: Hurts...?
 7265: Oh, great teacher! Allow me to speak for you. I've memorized every word you've said...
 7266: That we can now leave here in pieces...under the messed shadow of the Grated Star Tree...easel tanks to the great zero, Kalhua-Milkhua...!
 7267: Well, I guess a tooth-ache or two is to be expected when you go around eating that much honey. That's just nature's providence!
 7268: ...... Ouch...! My tooth hurths... Oo`hhwww...
 7269: Hmm... It's certainly got a lot quieter around here all of a sudden. I don't know whether to feel guilty or whether I did everyone a service by this.
 7270: Say... Just how much honey did you give the old guy? He must have sure enjoyed that honey if he ate so much it rotted his teeth!
 7271: Oh, but don't you be putting on that sad face now, dear. It wasn't your fault the old public speaker gave himself a toothache. Here, these will cheer you up...
 7272: ...!!!
 7273: Erch... How bitter!!!
 7274: <blah> What is this bitter medicine you've given me...!?
 7275: I'll nevther forgive you for the bittersweet ending you'thve given me!
 7276: Yeah! The great teacher's throat is better again!
 7277: What an effective medicine you have there. I say...well done!
 7278: I guess having a little rootin'-tootin' noise around this place makes it feel more like Windurst ought to feel.
 7279: Here, let me give you this as thanks on behalf of the great teacher. I hope you like it...
 7280: I guess having a little rootin'-tootin' noise around this place makes it feel more like Windurst ought to feel.
 7281: I just hope that old gent doesn't go overdoing his sermons again, lest he gives himself another sore throat.
 7282: This is Windurst Walls, the centermost of the four districts that make up the Federation of Windurst. It is also the political centaru of Windurst.
 7283: If you need directions to make your way around Windurst Walls, go ask Jack of Diamonds in the open area down thattaru way.
 7284: Help! I don't wantaruy be eaten by this angry Mithra womany! Please protectaruy me!
 7285: You have some kinda business with us guards here? Then first you've gotta speak to Zokima-Rokima on the top of the steps there. He's our leader-reader!
 7286: A foreigner, eh? Do you have business here, or are you just a lost tourist-bourist? You're in Windurst Walls, by the way, and this is the Heavens Tower gatehouse.
 7287: Head west from here to go to Windurst Waters, south to go to Port Windurst, or step onto the magical blue circle-hircle at the end of the hall here to teleport inside of Heavens Tower.
 7288: ERROR: SAYING A MASKED ANSWER!
 7289: You cannotaru accept more than one mission at a time. Please completaru your current mission before applying for the next.
 7290: Letaru me see... The missions you are able to receive...
 7291: Which mission will you accept? [The Horutoto Ruins Experiment./The Heart of the Matter./The Price of Peace./Lost for Words./A Testing Time./The Three Kingdoms./Mission 2-3-1A./Mission 2-3-1B./Mission 2-3-2A./Mission 2-3-2B./To Each His Own Right./Written in the Stars./A New Journey./Magicite./The Final Seal./The Shadow Awaits./Full Moon Fountain./Saintly Invitation./The Sixth Ministry./Awakening of the Gods./Vain./The Jester Who'd Be King./Doll of the Dead./Moon Reading./Dummy11./Dummy12./Dummy13./Dummy14./Dummy15./Dummy16./Dummy17./Decline mission.]
 7292: You came to inquire about missions, huh? Then ask our guard leader-reader up there. He's certainly-mertainly a man with a mission or two.
 7293: This is Heavens Tower's gatehouse, and we are the guards who protectaru Heavens Tower.
 7294: You look new around these partarus. Do you know aboutaru the role of the gatehouses?
 7295: Know much aboutaru gatehouses? [No, I don'taru./Yes, enough.]
 7296: Oh, so you know aboutaru us? Then let's give you a mission to try your hand ataru!
 7297: It's all aboutaru learning from experience. Don't worry aboutaru the details. Just accept a mission and see if you can completarue it.
 7298: Gatehouses are where we guards keep a round-the-clock vigil.
 7299: The role of guards is to protectaru Windurst from monsters and bad people. Or as we prefer to putaru it...we're the heroes of justaruice, libertaruy, and love.
 7300: Gatehouses also serve as the places where importantaru missions from the Federation of Windurst are received and handed out to adventarurers.
 7301: If you're a capable adventarurer, confidentaru in your own abilities, then why notaru take on a mission and serve to protectaru Windurst's justaruice, libertaruy, and love together with us?
 7302: Receive a mission? [Acceptaru./Decline.]
 7303: Okay then... Hey, Keo-Koruo...!
 7304: ...Looks like he's preoccupied. So, erm, hey Pakke-Pokke...! Give the newcomer a mission appropriatarue for [his/her] rank, please.
 7305: Roger-dodger! Let me see... What do I have for a first rank weakling...erm, I mean, newbie wanna-be adventurer like you...
 7306: How about helping the Orastery to conduct a magic experiment? You might make a good guinea piggy-giggy.
 7307: Seems like it's going down in the eastern magical tower-zower of the Horutoto Ruins out in Sarutabaruta.
 7308: I thought thataru Orastery mob was beyond help, but it looks like they're asking for a hand. Well, let's make this your first mission anyway, and see how you go with itaru.
 7309: Head over to the Orastery building in Port Windurst and ask the minister there for the mission details.
 7310: No greataru loss... If someone doesn'taru have their heart in it, then you can hardly expectaru them to provide good results, now can you?
 7311: Anyway, come back and tell us when you feel like doing something for your country for a change.
 7312: Head over to the Orastery building in Port Windurst and ask the minister there for your mission details.
 7313: Oh, and just in case you didn'taru know... The Orastery is one of the five ministries of Windurst. It is also known as the "Mage Academy," as itaru is the place where they train the most powerful magic users to help serve the Federation.
 7314: Gee...why didn'taruy they let me give you the mission briefingy? I'm sick of serving as the punching bag for this angry Mithra and her list of complaintaruys.
 7315: It's a long and higgledy-piggledy road to get the Orastery from here. First, you have to head south past the auction house and down the road that leads to Windurst Woods.
 7316: Then you have to pass through to the western side of Windurst Woods and head out the exit to Port Windurst. You should be able to find the building-duilding by the shore there.
 7317: I'm sure you're going to get totally-rotally lost, so make sure you check your map regularly, okay!?
 7318: Well done! We'll allocatarue you rank points according to our evaluation of your mission. Come back again soon and try your hand ataru another mission.
 7319: Well done! We'll allocatarue you rank points according to our evaluation of your mission. Come back again soon and try your hand ataru another mission.
 7320: Were the Horutoto Ruins as topsy-turvy confusing for you as they are for me? No matter how many times I go there, I still manage to get lost.
 7321: Somebody please do somethingy. I'm notaruy supposed to be the complaints desk, I'm supposed to be a hip and happening guardy!
 7322: Hmm... Nextaru we have a mission from the Manustery!
 7323: The Manustery is another one of the five ministries of Windurst. Seems they need assistance in the creation of automaton guards ataru their Cardian workshop.
 7324: Whataru do you reckon? Think you're up to this mission?
 7325: Acceptaru this mission? [Acceptaru./Decline.]
 7326: Greataru! Then head to the Manustery in Windurst Woods.
 7327: You should be able to see a building high on the hill when you look up from the Bomingo Round in Windurst Woods. Thataru's the Manustery, otherwise known as the Cardian workshop.
 7328: Go ask the staff who work ataru the Manustery's Cardian workshop in Windurst Woods for the details of your mission.
 7329: To getaru to Windurst Woods from here, just cross the bridge and head south. Keep heading south pastaru the auction house and across the bridge there. I recommend you keep checking your map so as not to getaru lost.
 7330: Windurst Walls is the scariestaruy district of Windurstaruy. Mainly because it is filled with Mithra like this oney.
 7331: Ooopsy! I'm sorry! I didn'taruy mean to speak ill of the Mithra! Nice lady! Don'taruy bite me, lady!
 7332: The automaton guards, known as Cardians, are the compilation of animation magic and are really-heally a remarkable invention.
 7333: When they are newly created, they are just like little baby-mabies. As we teach them how to speak and how to fight, they quickly grow smarter and smarter!
 7334: What's that you said? Don't you darrre rrrepeat that!
 7335: Seems like you've settled into your life in Windurst quitarue well. I hope your fighting skills have also improved.
 7336: We've prepared this nextaru mission for someone just like you.
 7337: Your destaruination will be Giddeus--home of the Yagudo beastmen--on the other side of West Sarutabaruta.
 7338: Windurst and the Yagudo have long been enemies, fightaruing over the riches of Sarutabaruta since ancient times.
 7339: But for the lastaru twenty years, since the war ended, Windurst has been working hard ataru maintaining peaceful relations with the Yagudo.
 7340: As a sign of our amicability, we provide them with food offerings. This is where your nextaru mission comes into the picture.
 7341: You are to go and receive some food offerings from the Rhinostery over in Windurst Waters and deliver them to Giddeus.
 7342: There are two altars for the offerings above ground before the entrances to inner Giddeus. In order to fulfill your mission, you are to place a food offering ataru each of these altars.
 7343: The problem is...even though we are supposed to have amicable relations with the Yagudo, they do not allow us people to enter Giddeus. So once you setaru foot in there, you're fair game.
 7344: I don'taru think we should have to risk our lives in order to deliver them a presentaru of food. But, oops, I've said too much. I never said thataru last bit, okay?
 7345: Head over to the Rhinostery in Windurst Waters and pick up the food offerings for the Yagudo. Then go deliver them to Giddeus.
 7346: Windurst Waters is west of where we stand in Windurst Walls. The quickestaru way to get there is to cross the bridge nextaru to Koru-Moru's manor.
 7347: It's only natural that we need to keep patience-matience and put forth constant effort in order to be friends with the Yagudo.
 7348: We're talking about a pack of beastmen. Their way of thinking is totally different from us people-beople. The first and foremost thing to strive for is to understand-ermand the other party.
 7349: Oh, greataruy! Now this Mithra woman is angry over the mission you were just assignedy.
 7350: Yes, we are providing notaruy only food, but weapons and armor, to the Yagudo. But such is the price of peacey.
 7351: Don't you dare tell me you agrrreed to that mission of carrying offerrrings to the beastmen in Giddeus!?
 7352: Grrr... And you think I'm going to stand by and let you do that without giving you a piece of my mind!?
 7353: Good, good... Thataru seemed to go withoutaru a hitch this time.
 7354: Oh, and congratarulations! Now thataru you've cleared three missions, you are entitled to advance to rank two!
 7355: Before I can issue you another mission, we require you to participate in the conquest campaign for a while in order to amass some rank points. Speak to the guard in charge of conquests for further details.
 7356: Let's keep working together to protectaru Windurst's justaruice, libertaruy, and love!
 7357: You were promotarued to rank two? Boy, thataruy was quicky! Before I know it, you'll be a higher rank than me.
 7358: Congratulations on advancing-mancing in rank! Say, now that you mention-bention it...just how many ranks are there? I've given up hope of further promotion so have forgotten-rotten.
 7359: I don't give a damn whetherrr you went up to rrrank two or not.
 7360: I only wish you'd hurry up and make these slackerrrs underrrstand just how overrrly apathetic and laid-back Windurst has become.
 7361: How unusual.. We have justaru received an urgentaru mission from the Optistery.
 7362: The Optistery runs the local Library of Magic and is the mostaru rigid of Windurst's ministries. They usually keep to themselves and don'taru cause any trouble.
 7363: Why don'taru you take up this rare chance of serving the Optistery, as it's sure got my interestaru plucked!
 7364: Acceptaru this mission? [Acceptaru./Decline.]
 7365: The Library of Magic thataru the Optistery runs is west of here, in Windurst Waters. To find out whataru the mission involves, speak to the Minister of the Optistery in the library there.
 7366: You remember how to getaru to Windurst Waters, rightaru? Head west and cross the bridge nextaru to old Koru-Moru's manor.
 7367: The Library of Magic thataru the Optistery runs is west of here, in Windurst Waters. To find outaru what your mission involves, speak to the Minister of the Optistery in the library there.
 7368: You remember how to getaru to Windurst Waters, rightaru? Head west and cross the bridge nextaru to old Koru-Moru's manor.
 7369: The books and scrolls made in Windurstaruy look justaruy like ordinary books and scrolls do. But what's inside is totally differentaruy!
 7370: It's kind of like the wands in the Mage Academy, in thataruy those library books are dangerous things to play withy. You simply don'taruy know what bizarre enchantment has been placed on themy.
 7371: I wonder-zonder if it is really true that all of the knowledge of Windurst is stored away in the Library of Magic?
 7372: I've even heard-deard that a book written by the very first Star Sibyl is still preserved as new in there!
 7373: A-hah!? Magic books, eh? I once hearrrd from someone that there was an uproarrr when a magic book fell into the hands of the Yagudo.
 7374: But that's beside the point. For crrrying out loud...would you shorrrties get out of my way and let me meet the Starrr Sibyl?
 7375: This mission will let you see the bestaru and worstaru of Windurst.
 7376: The Aurastery, the ministry thataru runs the School of Magic, has issued a large-scale mission. It looks like it'll consume a fair amountaru of time, but if you're still up for itaru...
 7377: Accept the mission? [Acceptaru./Decline.]
 7378: The School of Magic, as the name suggests, is where we educate our promising young magic users.
 7379: This mission will affectaru how these children will grow up, and therefore the whole future of Windurst. I pray you can putaru up a good fightaru!
 7380: The School of Magic is in the Windurst Waters district, west of here. Quitarue a number of child prodigies study within the school grounds.
 7381: Butaru to receive the details of this mission, you'll have to speak to the teachers in the staff room there. Good luck with this mission...for our children's future.
 7382: Did you know thataruy the Principal of the School of Magic is the renowned Professor Koru-Moru?
 7383: Years ago, the person Professor Koru-Moru appointarued as his successor to become principal ran away. What an awkward position that put him iny.
 7384: There are two grades of students in the School of Magic. The exceedingly brilliant children-shildren are placed in the advanced class.
 7385: On the other hand, the not-so-exceedingly brilliant students-dutents are placed into the beginners class. That's just the way the world works, I guess-fess...
 7386: If you have enough time on yourrr hands to do that silly mission, why don't you lend us Mithra a hand forrr a change?
 7387: Oh, come on. Give me a brrreak! Grrr...I've had it with these guarrrds!
 7388: Looks like your time has finally come! Now's the startaru of an adventure that will take you all over the world!
 7389: To be briefed on whataru your next mission entails, head on into the Heavens Tower Clerical Chamber. So chop-chop, you've gotaru a long way to go once you step inside here...
 7390: I'd like a chance to try one of these large-scale missions, but I don't really think-fink I'm up to it.
 7391: You see, I'm the type of Tarutaru who can't sleep on a different pillow-billow, gets seasick and airsick, and is disliked by every chocobo-kookobo he comes across. I'm just not cut out to travel-ravel.
 7392: Have you ever had the chance to talk to Ms. Kupipi up in the Clerical Chamber of Heavens Taruwer?
 7393: She may not look itaruy, but she has quite a noggin on her. Why, she's memorized all the names and faces of every guard and adventarurer in the whole of Windurstaruy!
 7394: Any adventarurer wants to travel around the whole world, butaru when you are asked to do itaru for your country, then it's like killing two jubjubs with one Stone spell!
 7395: Step inside Heavens Tower behind me and inquire ataru the Clerical Chamber to hear the full briefing of your mission. Hurry on up now!
 7396: Hey! Just wherrre are you heading now?
 7397: Well, when you speak to the Tarutaru inside of herrre, tell them to go see forrr themselves just how equipped otherrr countries are to fight off the beastmen.
 7398: Thank goodness you stopped by! You have been summoned to go inside Heavens Tower again!
 7399: And what's scarier still is thataru the person calling for you is none other than the Sibyl Guard Semih Lafihna, or as we at Heavens Tower call her...the defender of law and justaruice!
 7400: Hurry up and head inside Heavens Tower. Semih Lafihna is a busy lady, and notaru someone you wantaru to keep waiting.
 7401: As head of the Sibyl Guards, Semih Lafihna almostaru always carries out her investigations by herself.
 7402: Itaru is most unusual for her to issue a mission such as this. Itaru kind of makes you wonder whataru is going on...? But there I go saying too much again.
 7403: The Sibyl Guards are the Mithran warrior-borriors who serve the Star Sibyl.
 7404: They are all so serious-zerious and strong-drong and oh so cool-looking. Why, they are once...no, twice...no, thrice more fly than the other Mithra who stray about this town!
 7405: Whenever you mention the Sibyl Guards to the other Mithra in this town, they screw their faces up into feline frowns.
 7406: Don'taruy ask me why... You'll have to find out for yourselfy. Just don'taruy ask that Mithra woman therey. She'll scratch your eyes out with her tempery!
 7407: I hearrrd that! You'rrre talking about the Sibyl Guards, rrright?
 7408: They'rrre no Mithra, that mob. They werrre rrraised by the Tarutaru, so they have lost theirrr Mithran spirit! Why, they'rrre nothing more than a band of traitorrrs!
 7409: Woo-hoo... Guess who this mission is from!
 7410: Why, it's from the woman who has run the ladies-in-waiting with an iron fistaru for the last few decades, the oldest of the old guard, yes, it's the Star Sibyl's head lady-in-waiting, none other than Zubaba herself!
 7411: Anyway, she's waiting for you up in Heavens Tower's Vestal Vestibule. This is one old lady you don'taru want to keep waiting!
 7412: I don'taru think old Zubaba has ventured out from Heavens Tower for years now.
 7413: In fact, it may even be decades since she lastaru stepped out of there. Then again, Heavens Tower would never be the same withoutaru her, so I guess she feels she can'taru leave.
 7414: When I was selected to serve as a guard in front of Heavens Tower, I was over the moon-boon! Just the thought of becoming friend-priends with all those ladies-in-waiting...Hum-hmm...
 7415: That dream was soon shattered-splattered when mean old Zubaba cracked down on the young ladies-in-waiting going outside. It brings tears to my eyes-cries!
 7416: Zubaba's been running things in Heavens Taruwer since the currentaruy Star Sibyl was a child...which makes her pretty old when you think aboutaruy ity!
 7417: It's a wonder she hasn'taruy become bored, locking herself up inside Heavens Taruwer for all that timey. I'm surprised she hasn'taruy turned into a mushroom by nowy!
 7418: Hmm... This has to be a mistake. But I've checked itaru several times...
 7419: Itaru appears to be $6 addressed to you. A letter with the star emblem on itaru, signifying it's of the utmost importance, has been sentaru to you!
 7420: The mostaru revered person in all Windurst--if this isn'taru a mistake, thataru is--has summoned you!
 7421: Letters with the star emblem on them like this one are the most importantaru papers issued by Heavens Tower. Usually they are only sentaru to elite people such as the ministers of the five ministries.
 7422: Itaru is extremely rare for a star emblem letter to be issued to a lowly adventurer such as you... Hey, don'taru tell me you're an undercover agent checking up on us or something!?
 7423: I'm not the least bit jealous-mealous! I've delivered a document with the star emblem on it to the minister-pinister of the Orastery before.
 7424: I can remember I was so nervous-dervous back then. I was in a cold sweat at the thought of what punishment-bunishment would await me if I lost the darned thing.
 7425: The entrance to Heavens Taruwer is justaruy therey. Don'taruy stand out here wondering what to do. Hurry up and go insidey!
 7426: When you're up there in the Planetarium, could you please-blease make a wish for the peace of Windurstaruy?
 7427: What's all the rrruckus about? Has something happened in Heavens Towerrr?
 7428: Itaru's a pity I cannotaru welcome you back under better circumstances. If you haven'taru heard, Windurst is now officially in a state of emergency.
 7429: Emergency orders have been given to all guards and adventarurers most loyal to Windurst, and the issuance of missions has been stopped pending further instructions from Heavens Tower.
 7430: No matter how you look at it, you can't help but conclude something major-dajor is going down in Heavens Tower right now.
 7431: The head of the Sibyl Guards, Semih Lafihna, has been going-zoing in and out of here all day. My arms are tired from giving her the Windurstian salute-dalute each time she passes by.
 7432: The Minister of the Rhinostery, Ms. Rukususu, has come back to Windurstaruy.
 7433: Although she's been in the arctic for such a long time, she was still as beautaruful as every. Oh, gosh! I think I'm falling for hery...
 7434: This is an urgentaru mission from Heavens Tower!
 7435: Your destination is the cursed Northlands...the ruins of Fei'Yin, northeastaru of the Beaucedine Glacier.
 7436: There aren'taru that many adventurers who could survive a journey like this.
 7437: I'm just relieved an adventarurer as strong as yourself has volunteered to make [himself/herself] available for this mission.
 7438: It seems you need to collectaru a seal from within Heavens Tower before you go, so you had better go do thataru now.
 7439: I pray you have a safe journey!
 7440: Your mission's destaruination is the cursed Northlands...the ruins of Fei'Yin, northeastaru of the Beaucedine Glacier.
 7441: If you don'taru have the necessary seal yetaru, then you should pick it up from within Heavens Tower before you departaru.
 7442: Where in Vana'diel is this Fei'Yin place-blace? Huh? Way up north past-fast the Beaucedine Glacier?
 7443: That still doesn't tell-jell me where it is... All I can make out is that it's going to be a really cold-old place. Better pack-zack your long johns!
 7444: I just overheard a littarul from the people coming out of Heavens Taruwer.
 7445: Sounds as if the very importarunt talisman that sealed away the spooky old lord of the beastmen has been stolen! Don'taruy tell me... You're being sent to retrieve it, rightaruy?
 7446: I have a bad feeling about this, butaru another $3 is addressed to you.
 7447: Maybe you are destined to carry out great deeds like the hero Karaha-Baruha, who saved Windurst twenty years ago.
 7448: Anyway, you had better proceed on into Heavens Tower. I assume the Star Sibyl is awaiting you.
 7449: The Star Sibyl is waitaruing for you in Heavens Tower. You'd better hurry and go inside.
 7450: Go on to do great deeds, my friend. Just like the hero Karaha-Baruha did twenty years ago.
 7451: Don't you sometimes wonder whether people and beastmen can really ever understand one another-brother?
 7452: The Star Sibyl thought that someday we would understand-berstand one another and tried all manner of things to work to that goal, but nothing really changed.
 7453: I wonder-monder if it is, as they say, set in the stars? The movement of the stars never changes-shanges, does it?
 7454: It seems thataruy the meeting of the five ministries ended all too soony.
 7455: Professor Koru-Moru turned up on time for once, and Minister Ajido-Marujido didn't even complainy! It was too quietaruy. I don'taruy like ity!
 7456: Whether your name goes down in the history-mistory of Windurst or not doesn't matter. What you did was indeed a great deed-yeed!
 7457: Thank you, adventurer-henturer! Please keep using that mighty-righty power of yours for the peace of Windurst!
 7458: The ministaru of the Rhinostery, Ms. Rukususu, came out of Heavens Tower with the mostaruy cheerful look on her facey.
 7459: Now my heart, too, is as brightaruy and cheerful as Windurstaruy isy. There isn't a cloud in sightaruy nowy!
 7460: Why, hello`! And, oh...goodbye!
 7461: Well, excu`se me, [Mister/Ms.] So-and-so! You shouldn't be walking into these premises without permission, you know! Ohoho...Ignorance is no excuse. No, no!
 7462: This manor is where scholars, who have rendered many years of noble service to their ministry, can further enjoy the pursuit of knowledge in peace and quiet as a reward. It is not a place where plebeians like you should enter on your own accord!
 7463: The Tarutaru with titles such as doctor or professor are the learned ladies and intelli-gents who served as ministers of the five ministries of Windurst.
 7464: Do you know of the good Doctor Shantotto, my dear? Well, she was once the Minister of the Orastery, the ministry also known as the "Mage Academy," where all the most-powerful mages of Windurst train. That's what I call a "mage-or-leaguer"!
 7465: Gee... For safety's sake, I wouldn't recommend going-woing too close to Doctor Shantotto's manor! She thinks the whole world was made for her personal-wersonal pleasure.
 7466: Doctor Shantotto, the former Minister of the Orastery, or "Mage Academy," lives in this house here. I'm sure that she's hiding something-womething!
 7467: Who am I? Well, I'm the reporter who's waiting to get a tell-all interview with her! You see, I write for the Tarutaru Times' "Magic Paradise Weekly."
 7468: They say old Doc Shantotto's as high-and-mighty as Yutungah's firey mountain, and as rough-cut as the rocky Gustaberg Ranges-wanges.
 7469: I'm getting pretty nervous about meeting the grumpy old doc... If only I knew what kind of things she liked, I'd be able to buy her a little gift to make a good first impression-wession.
 7470: No matter how scary they say old Doc Shantotto is, I should be okay...so long as I don't make her angry-wangry.
 7471: Standing around here trying to ward off the heebie-jeebies is only delaying me from writing the story of the century-wentury. I've got to pluck up the courage and go confront-awont her!
 7472: Lately, my dear, I have the most unpleasant feeling, you see... I feel as though someone is constantly watching me!
 7473: It must be one of my many admirers, or maybe, I dare to think, even a spy! It is giving me the jimjams! I'm not a cheap street show, am I?
 7474: I say... Would you like to help me, my dear? I'm thinking of showing that Peeping Tom just who he's up against...you hear!?
 7475: Agree to help? [Yes./No.]
 7476: Jolly well! Now grab a quill and jot these down. I'll need $6 and two $7! Ohoho... This will be quite a sight to see, so stick around!
 7477: How dare you turn a poor, defenseless old lady like ME down? Do you think something so unpleasant will befall me that you'd rather watch from the sidelines than get involved? You clown!
 7478: Most unforgivable, [I'm glad I'm not your sister/you big sissy]! Perhaps you should watch your back too, [mister/missy]!
 7479: Ohoho... Still haven't found me my $6 and two $7 yet? Well, I'm incensed! Hurry up. I can't wait to show my little voyeur just who he's up against!
 7480: Oh, goody. You've brought me my $6 and $7, I see. Now to put these straight to good use... Ho`cus-po`cus, boogy-bogey fo`cus!!!
 7481: Here, dear, take this as your reward. Ohohohoho!
 7482: You should have a little check around town tomorrow and see who's not doing so fine. Whoever has been spying on me will be having a most bone-boogying time!
 7483: You should have a little check around town tomorrow and see who's not doing so fine. Whoever has been spying on me will be having a most bone-boogying time!
 7484: I've finally plucked up the courage-wourage. First thing tomorrow, I'm gonna walk in that door and conduct that interview with Doctor Shantotto!
 7485: Just standing here, staring at her house all day, every day... And I call myself a reporter? Well, as of tomorrow, it's no more procrastination-wation for me!
 7486: ...Erck! I haven't been feeling so good since the other night-wight...
 7487: Whenever I shut my eyes...like this, erck...I see these red eyes spinning around and around in the darkness...and, and my shoulders feel all weighed down-wown, and all...Woa`h!
 7488: Ohoho! Our peeping Tom's been enjoying that Skeleton Dance curse I placed on him, no? But don't feel too sorry for him, as it'll wear off within a day or so.
 7489: But, my, haven't I mellowed with age?
 7490: You should have seen me back when I was the Minister of the Orastery. I pulled no punches at that stage. Ohohohoho`!
 7491: Oh? You didn't see anyone doing the old Skeleton Dance, eh?
 7492: That's most strange indeed...I say. It sure felt as if my curse had taken effect...well, either way...
 7493: ...Erck...!
 7494: Ah! Thank goodness...there you are! I've been looking all over Windurst for you! Ha`h!
 7495: Say...you don't happen to have any dependents, do you? Like, would anyone be saddened if you were put behind bars? Would anyone grieve if you, er...disappeared to the stars?
 7496: If you went missing, people would... [Cry in despair./Cry out in joy!]
 7497: Well, no matter, either way. That doesn't concern me today.
 7498: Personally, I don't want to rot in prison, you see...! So, it's inevitable that you're the one who'll take the fall for me.
 7499: Hey, you were my accomplice, you know!? You cannot say that it's not so.
 7500: If you recall, without pride or plom... you're the one who helped me cast a curse on that peeping Tom!
 7501: You know...the Skeleton Dance curse, you cur!? I used your $4 and $5, along with my misery staff, to vex the voyeur.
 7502: Well, the truth is, that wasn't the "Skeleton Dance" curse I cast. It seems I did the old "Invoke the Grip of Death" curse, oh blast! (An honest mistake...that anyone would make...)
 7503: So, we actually have hexed the person to death, I fear. Quite a disagreeable aftertaste for an act of sweet vengeance, dear.
 7504: But maybe Death hasn't taken a complete hold of him yet. We might still have time to save him, so don't sweat!
 7505: Oh, but to undo the curse, we'll need two $6, $7 and next... a lock of hair of the unfortunate person we hexed.
 7506: $7 are quite hard to come by and it's impossible to remove a lock of the cursed person's hair without them noticing, I dread...
 7507: So I guess we may as well give up on that plan and just have you take the blame for the both of us and go to jail instead!
 7508: Of course it won't be forever that you'll be locked in the cage. I'm sure you'll be out, say, just before I die of old age. But hey, remember, notoriety can bring fortune and fame! So you can have that all...along with the blame!
 7509: Agree to go to jail? [No way! Not on your life!/Well, OK. If you say so...]
 7510: Ohoho! I'm glad you're so understanding. It makes matters as simple as you are, darling. All you have to do is go to the local gatehouse, confess to the crime, and turn yourself in.
 7511: O`h! You're making me lose my temper, dear!
 7512: Fine! If you want to avoid imprisonment, you'll just have to go find: two $6, $7, and a lock of hair of the cursed person...if you don't mind.
 7513: If you can do that impossible feat, I'll smooth things over for you, nice and neat!
 7514: If you want to avoid imprisonment, you'll just have to go find: two $6, $7, and a lock of hair of the cursed person...if you don't mind.
 7515: If you can do that impossible feat, I'll smooth things over for you, nice and neat!
 7516: ...Erck...k...k...!
 7517: Oh, wow! You really found all the things we need...but how?
 7518: Oh, and gee...! You even managed to obtain the hair, I see... Which means he's still alive, and well, is he?
 7519: Which means neither of us need to go to jail after all! Ohoho! I'm so glad I don't have to wear a chain and ball.
 7520: Here. Let me remove that nasty curse without a moment's delay. For even as we speak, the seconds to his death are still ticking away...
 7521: I hope I'm not too late, dearie... Here it goes... Wha`mm`y!!!
 7522: ...Ohoho. Well, that cleared that right up.
 7523: I'm glad I've a knack for undoing hexes. It sure gets me out of such little vexes.
 7524: Anyway, I've had enough of cursing for the time being. Here, I'll give you this Misery Staff...if you're agreeing.
 7525: After all, it won't hurt to dispose of the evidence. Especially if the victim takes offense...ohohoho!
 7526: Ohoho! Don't get angry with me for that little disgrace. It was the Orastery's mages who found that miserable staff in the first place.
 7527: But don't you worry about it. Control your lividity. I'll make sure they pay dearly for their stupidity. Ohohohoho!
 7528: Phew... I think I'm feeling a little better now-wow.
 7529: It's like the mist has cleared from my eyes and the weight has been lifted from my shoulders. Why, it's almost as if that mystery illness never happened-wappened.
 7530: Ergh... Why, diddly-doodley, do you bother me? I was just riding on the back of a fire dragon as she flew off into the starry night, too...
 7531: Ergh... Why, diddly-doodley, do you bother me? I was just in mortal combat with the Shadow Lord, and about to receive a good-luck kiss from the maiden I saved, too...
 7532: ...Hm? You must be the diddly-doodley one. You know, the adventurer who defeated the flan-dangle-wangled Shadow Lord. Yeah...
 7533: Well, damn, good for you! Actually, a super-dooper-wooper spell to X-zone the Shadow Lord for good was supposed to be my twenty-three thousand thirty-fifth study subject, but you had to diddly-duddely go ahead and defeat him before I could complete it. Argh!
 7534: You know the manor just in front of the bridge that leads out to West Sarutabaruta? Well, that's where an eccentriperculiar old man called Professor Koru-Moru resides. For a school principal, he's not that schooled or principled!
 7535: Gee... That Professor Koru-Moru sure is a strange one. But what's even strangery-wangery is that they made him Principal of the School of Magic.
 7536: Ergh... Why, diddly-doodley, do you bother me? I was just riding on an ice dragon as she flew around a silver moon, too...
 7537: Hm? Wait a cotton-pickin' seconderoony. Why do you smell like my sweetie-pie pen-pal Mojiji!? Are you into wearing the same perfectareeno perfume as her?
 7538: Oh my dearily-doorily-dear! It's no time to be lost in flights of fantasy. I must finish that research as soon-a-roon as possible...
 7539: ...Hey, you there, heidely-ho! For you to suddenly appear-aroo in front of me at this particular time-a-riner must have been the will of the stars.
 7540: Quick-aroo! At the speed-a-reedero of light! You must search around Sarutabaruta and find me a rough black stone!
 7541: Agree to help? [Yes./No.]
 7542: What!? Why, you [wanna-be warrior/warrior wanna-be/novice monk/immature mage/amateur mage/greenhorn mage/naive thief/newbie adventurer]! How dare you turn-a-rurn me down-a-roo!
 7543: Good-o, great-o! Then hurry up and-a-get-a-going! That black stone-a-roo is the first step of my great ambition! It'll make me more famouseroony than the stars! Wahahaha!
 7544: Say, hey, doodily-do. Hurry up and find me that "rough black stone"-aroo I'm looking for! I'm way too busy-a-whizzy with my researcheroony to search myself!
 7545: Hey! Why do you have my love letter to my pen-pal sweet-eroony sweetie-pie Mojiji!?
 7546: I want it back-a-reeno! Here, I'll give you this for it, so hand it doodily-over.
 7547: A rough black stone? Yeah, the professorrr who lives in this manorrr once tried to give me one of those in lieu of his debts.
 7548: Grrrowl! Just remembering it rubs my furrr the wrong way! The old fool claims those strange stones are really starrrs that fell from the sky or some such nonsense.
 7549: <Sigh> When I sawy the falling stary the other day I made a wishy. I wishyed that Principal Koru-Moru would stoppy acting like a baby and get overy his stubbornness.
 7550: Oh, dearie-dear? Has that spot-dotty Professor Koru-Moru got you running errands for him now? Typical of old Principal Koru-Moru...totally dependent on the grace of others. Most precarious!
 7551: Did you know? Did you know? If you say a wish three times before a falling star disappears, it will come true! However, I always screw it up and get angry... Perhaps I'm star-crossed?
 7552: Gee... The other night when I looked up at the starry-warry sky, a trail of lighty-wighty went "wooshy-wooshy," streaming down to the ground. I think it would have hit the earthy-wearthy out there in West Sarutabaruta somewhere.
 7553: Now that you mention-wention it, Professor Koru-Moru once showed me one of his rough black stones.
 7554: He said an adventurer went out and found it for him, but I wonder where in Vana'diel you'd pick up something-womething like that?
 7555: Oh, you know about those falling stars as well, huh?I've been fortunate enough to eye-spy and peek-a-boo a few of them myself, too.
 7556: What did I wish for? Naturally, I wished that Windurst would have everlasting peace and prosperity, joy and security, success and serenity!
 7557: Did you know thith? Did you know thith? When you thee a falling thtar, if you thay a withh three timeth before it dithappearth, then your with will come true!
 7558: Tho pleathe tell me... What happenth to the thtar when it fallth to earth? Can it find itth way home back to the thky again?
 7559: The Tarutaru go all silly over making wishes on falling starrrs, but we Mithra don't believe in such nonsense.
 7560: It's probably a harrrbinger that something really bad's about to happen. Heh, and about time, too. I've been yearrrning to run wild for a bit. Ahh, my blood is rrrushing already!
 7561: As for us Mithra, we call falling starrrs "tears from heaven." It is looked upon as a rrrather bad omen, though.
 7562: There seems to have been a minor earthquake-o out in West Sarutabaruta the other day-o. I s'pose an airship-o dropped its cargo or somethin' naff like that-o...!
 7563: Say-o, have you heard-o the old sayin'? You know-o, that the "Yagudo are the sweepers of Sarutabaruta"?
 7564: If there is anything a little odd-o, rare-o, or out of place-o dropped in Sarutabaruta, the Yagudo swoop in and sweep them up-o. Seems they like collecting stuff-o, or somethin'.
 7565: Oh, sweet-aroo! What's that stone-a-roney you have there?
 7566: This is flanddandildelyagily it! It truly is a gift from heaven-areeno! Oh, and here's a diddly-doodley gift from me to you-aroo...
 7567: Hold diddly on-aron...! Is this really-doodily the stone-aroo I asked you for...? There's something odd-diddly-oddly here... Hmm...
 7568: Well, it diddley-doodily appears to be a stone-a-roney of some kind of strange power-a-wowser. See-o...it's made me a tinsy-weeny-bit hungry-areeno just looking at it-aroo.
 7569: Hoo-hoo-hoo-ho-hoo! I'm giddly-goodily glad you were able to fiddly-fondily find this stone-a-roney! My dufferoony students think that the reason the stars twinkle-a-winkle in the night sky-areeno is because they are made out of giant doodily-do jewels.
 7570: But you uncovered-eroony the truth-areeno that was out there-a-where! As a reward-aroo, I'll share a titsy-witsy wee bit of my research with you.
 7571: Be surprised-aroo... Be very surprised-arised-areeno-roo! I believe this stone-a-roney has the power to grantily-wantily-grant a person's wishes!
 7572: Hoo-hoo-hoo-ho-hoo! With this stone-areeno, my diddly-daddly-dear Mojiji, I'll make you mine-aroo! Hoo-hoo-hoo-a-hoo-hoo!
 7573: Ergh... Why, diddly-doodley, do you bother me? I was just swimming back-aroo through the stream-areemo of time, groping for lost memories.
 7574: But, heidely-hoddily! You're coming-a-rumming here was probably a result-areeno of some chain of wiggly-woggly events I triggered in the past-aroo.
 7575: So...are you skilled-a-willio at searching for stuff-areeno? The adventurers I meet-aroo are all supposed to be goodily-godily-good at finding a thing or two...
 7576: Good at finding things? [Yes./No.]
 7577: Then why-oh-googilyly-eye, did you come-reeno into my place of research-aroo for?
 7578: Good-o! Neat-o! Now hurry up and find-a-rindo me a burnite shell!
 7579: Burnite shells are extremely large, pointy-a-rointy shell-areenos. You'll know-a-wow when you diddley-doddily find one!
 7580: Hurry up and get-a-going-ing! We've got to get one before-a-wore Yoran-Oran realizes what I'm up to-aroo!
 7581: If he finds out-a-rout, then he'll never stop nagging-wagging-hagging-a-ragging me! I have no diddley-doddily time for people's chit-chat-areeno-roo!
 7582: Don't make a mistake-aroony! Be sure-diddly-oddily to get me a burnite shell, now! They are really big-areeno and pointy-spointy!
 7583: "...Time flow-ethy ever on and on, but the past is never-ethy gone."
 7584: "The past unceasingly-ethy piles up in toil, The lower layers decomposing-ethy into soil, Which supports-ethy this world's future yon..."
 7585: ...Hmm. Put it into writing-ethy and it comes out like this-ethy.
 7586: Goodness gracious. Has that utter nutter Professor Koru-Moru got you running errands again? What's it this time...?
 7587: Oh, burnite shells? You don't say...? Well, sorry. Never heard of them. Hoo-roo!
 7588: Shells? What are you asking me about shells forrr? Go to the porrrt and ask the people on the fishing boats or the memberrrs of the Fishermen's Guild if you want to know about seafood!
 7589: A burnite shelly...? Where have I heardy that namey beforey...?
 7590: Oh, I knowy! Doctor Yoran-Oran once mentionedy it, I thinky.
 7591: "...There are many-ethy a place which now is land, That was in antiquity submerged-ethy under the sea and sand."
 7592: "A prime example of such a place-ethy is the Maze of Shakhrami. You can find-ethy an array of fossilized sea life in the rocks there-ethy..."
 7593: ...Hmm. Now all I have to do-ethy is add an illustration of an ancient shell here-ethy as an example...
 7594: How peculiar-ethy! Why can't I find-ethy my fossil of a Burnite Shell? Where-ethy did it go-ethy?
 7595: Just when I was on a roll-ethy with my writing, too... Oh, damn-ethy, now I've lost-ethy all motivation.
 7596: Ho-hoo! Well diddly-doodley done! This is it-aroo! This is the shell-areeno I was searching-a-urching for!
 7597: Will this doodily-do as payment-aroo for your labor? Come backety-back and help me out again-eroony someday, eh?
 7598: What-aroo? Would a fossil diddily-doodily-do? Hahaha! If you could find-a-wind a burnite shell that's not a fossil-a-fissil, you'd be a greater doctor-eroony than old Yoran-Oran and I put together-areeno!
 7599: Now to secretly return this to my neighbor-rino, Yoran-Oran's room, before he realizes his is gone-aroo... Mumble-grumble...
 7600: No, no! This ain't it-aroo! Didn't I tell-a-rell you? I'm after a really big-areeno and pointy-spointy shell!
 7601: What-aroo? Would a fossil diddily-doodily-do? Hahaha! If you could find-a-wind a burnite shell that's not a fossil-a-fissil, you'd be a greater doctor-eroony than old Yoran-Oran and I put together-areeno!
 7602: Now to secretly return this to my neighbor-reeno, Yoran-Oran's room, before he realizes his is gone-aroo... Mumble-grumble...
 7603: Diddily...doodily... Hmm? What's your hum-diddly business here? I was just searching the voidilly-void of nothingness to find the answer of how to make some-doodily-thing from nothing.
 7604: No bother-wother-aroo. So, why is it that you call-diddly-called on my home-areeno?
 7605: You couldn't be...a massager-messenger from the dark-doodily-voidilly!?
 7606: Well-eroony, before anybody-buddy takes-and-bakes me away to the other side-areeno, I need to fan-diddly-finish my project-aroo.
 7607: I'm on the verge-areeny of something big-aroo, but I first have to figure out what I needly-need to make my prod-proddily-project happen.
 7608: Long-dingly-dong ago, there was this scientificated scientist who was studilly-studying an ancient art-aroo called "alchemy."
 7609: This alchem-eeno sounds really-diddily close to what I'm trying to doodilly-do--make some-diddily-something out of nothing-eroo.
 7610: However, that scientist's project was a failure-eeno...
 7611: That's where I come in! Maybe I can succeed where that other guy couldn't!
 7612: And guess what? You're going to help me!
 7613: Help the professor? [Yes-areeno./No-aroo.]
 7614: You're not? Then why the flip-diddily-do did you come here?
 7615: Stupen-diddi-licious! Now go and find an authority on alchemy and squeeze all the secrets out of her.
 7616: Hmm? You say that alchemy is not an ancient art?
 7617: Wah-hah-hah! There is no past or present in science.
 7618: There's got to be somebodily-buddily out there secretly researching alchemy.
 7619: You go out there and find her and get her to spittily-spit out all she knows about the subject. I don't care if you have to tickle her to death.
 7620: My, oh my. Does that crazy-lazy professor Koru-Moru have you out working for him again?
 7621: "Alchemy"? Sorry, Charlie, but I've never heard of that. Is it some kind of super-trooper magic?
 7622: Why don't you try asking the othery professors abouty this "alchemy"?
 7623: One of them mighty be secretly researching it!
 7624: Ohoho! Your reason for bargy-wargying into my home like this had better be fitting.
 7625: Alchemy? Ohohoho! You've got to be kidding!
 7626: There is no place for such circus tricks in Windurst! Just the talk of the subject makes my side burst!
 7627: Long ago, there was a student who did give the crazy subject a try...
 7628: Well, if I was a professor at the School of Magic, I would fail that lunatic in the blink of an eye!
 7629: "Alchemy"... I'd love to see-ethy the face of anyone crazy-hazy enough to still be researching that outdated science-ethy.
 7630: What? You say-ethy Koru-Moru is working on the subject-ethy?
 7631: Well, that's just like-ethy him--chasing after whatever is on his mind-ethy at the time.
 7632: Now that you mention it, I recall-ethy that the professor wrote-ethy a paper on the subject when he was still-ethy a student.
 7633: That imbecile-nibicile hasn't changed one bit-ethy since his school days. He's probably already forgot-ethy that he wrote-ethy that paper.
 7634: 
 7635: 
 7636: 
 7637: 
 7638: 
 7639: 
 7640: 
 7641: 
 7642: Excellent-areeno! This is exact-diddily-idily what I was looking for! Hmm...wonderfullific writing! Whoever wrote this must have been one great-daidilly-straight-'A' student.
 7643: Hmmm... Uh-huh...didilly... Yes...doodily...
 7644: !!!
 7645: Eureka-riddily-roo! I've got it! Our little genius's theory-areeno goes something-a-ling like this:
 7646: Mix a little bit of "lifeforce" with a dibble-dabbledy-do of the "power of death," and don't forget to take "time" and "temperature" into consideration.
 7647: Lifeforce? Sounds like some kind of egg to me. And power of death? May-biddily-be a bone...
 7648: Well, you're the adventurer-eeno, not me. I'll let you handle the diddily-details.
 7649: Just bring-dingily-ding me back some "lifeforce" and some "power of death."
 7650: Bring-dingily-ding me back some "lifeforce" and some "power of death." I'll let you handle the diddily-details.
 7651: Lifeforce? Sounds like some kind of egg to me. And power of death? May-biddily-be a bone...
 7652: Ah-hah! I see! $1 is the lifeforce and $2 is the power of death.
 7653: Heh-heh-heh. While you were gone, I solved the mystery-eroony of "time" and "temperature." Now it is time to begin our twisty-turny-journey into the unknown!
 7654: This experiment will take some "time," so why don't you come smack-buggily-back in a few day-aroos?
 7655: So impatient, you adventurers. Greateriffic discover-iddilies take time!
 7656: Come back in a few day-aroos. I have nuttily-nothing to show you now... Mumble-grumble...
 7657: Ah, you're fine-dinally here! The experiment-eroony--it was a success-areeno!
 7658: Here, look! Lookity-look-a-look at this! Can't you see it?
 7659: I've created some-diddly-something out of nothing! Here, look at the little fuzzy green thingies. They weren't there last week-aroo!
 7660: Well, all the dat-daddily-data proves my success! As an expression of my grat-tittily-tat-itude, take this gil-areeno!
 7661: Now, where-illy where did I put my research notes? Ah, here they are...
 7662: ...Then it hip-hoppily-hit me--high temperature and high humidity were the missing link-eroony.
 7663: And after a week's time, little-bitty green fuzzy-wuzzy thingies started to materialize from nothing. Their appearance-areeno was not unlike the mold that grows on old bread...
 7664: The mold that grows on old bread...?
 7665: Huh? What business-ethy do you have with me-ethy? I'm Yoran-Oran, the former minister-ethy of the Rhinostery.
 7666: Have you been to see-ethy the Rhinostery's biological laboratory in Windurst Waters yet-ethy? Well, you should. It's like-ethy a magical botanical garden!
 7667: Come to think of it... have you been to Doctor Yoran-Oran's manor lately? Such a lovely place with all those flowers blossoming there!t Oh, but some say it's blooming horridly florid!
 7668: Gee... Everybody "nose" about the Rhinostery. That's the ministry-winistry that runs a biological laboratory to study plants and stuff.
 7669: Doctor Yoran-Oran used to be the Minister of the Rhinostery, but now he's retired-wetired and just vegetates here in Windurst Walls.
 7670: Huh? What business-ethy do you have with me-ethy? I'm Yoran-Oran, the former minister-ethy of the Rhinostery.
 7671: Have you been to see-ethy the Rhinostery's biological laboratory in Windurst Waters yet-ethy? Well, you should. It's like-ethy a magical botanical garden!
 7672: My old Rhinostery has come to resemble-ethy a botanical garden that specializes in plants, but it really is meant to be-ethy a biological laboratory.
 7673: Originally it was a biological research center that dealt-ethy with the entire ecosystem of plants and animals. Of course that included-ethy the roles of monsters in the system of things.
 7674: For example, take-ethy that wonderful little bean-being, the mandragora, that's found-ethy out in Sarutabaruta. Before the Great War they didn't exist-ethy in these parts, but their numbers have constantly increased-ethy over the last couple of decades.
 7675: That got me interested-ethy in where they're originally from and how they came to arrive-ethy in Sarutabaruta. So right now I'm thinking-ethy of carrying out a study on them.
 7676: If you come across-ethy any mandragora-related items that might assist me with my research, please bring-ethy them to me. I'll buy-ethy each and every one I can off of you.
 7677: I'm thinking of carrying-ethy out a study on where mandragora originally come-ethy from and how they arrived-ethy in Sarutabaruta.
 7678: If you come across-ethy any mandragora-related items that might assist me with my research, please bring-ethy them to me. I'll buy-ethy each and every one I can off of you.
 7679: That is a most unusual item, but it doesn't help-ethy me with my research. My research is not the collection-ethy of curiosities per se, now.
 7680: This is worthy of further investigation indeed-ethy. If you happen upon-ethy any more items such as this, please be sure to bring-ethy them to me.
 7681: Yes, yes! I was waiting-ethy for something like this. This is definitely not from-ethy Sarutabaruta.
 7682: Hmm...If you come across-ethy any more items such as this, please be sure to bring-ethy them here to me.
 7683: What are these-ethy? This-ethy is amazing-ethy! I never expected-ethy the mandragora in the Outlands would have evolved-ethy like this.
 7684: I'd better look-ethy into this right away. This could lead-ethy to some new discovery!
 7685: That is a rather rare mandragora-related thing, but it doesn't help-ethy me with my research.
 7686: However, they say these can bring-ethy luck, so I'll take it off of your hands. Who knows, it might just help me think-ethy things over a little better.
 7687: You say-ethy that mandragora had-ethy $1, eh? It would be strange-ethy enough-ethy for a Rarab to show interest in such-ethy a thing-ethy, but for a mandragora...!?
 7688: Interesting-ethy! No, intriguing-ethy! I think this could be the beginning-ethy of some remarkable research-ethy!
 7689: If mandragoras drop-ethy something that looks as if it could aid-ethy me in my research, then please be sure to bring-ethy it back here to me.
 7690: I'm sorry-ethy, but now is not the time-ethy for that.
 7691: This is Heavens Tower. Protected by the Great Star Tree that grew to encompass the original tower, it is the most sacred-wacred site in Windurst.
 7692: The thoughts and voices of people from all over the world pass through-wough this great tree to reach the Goddess of the Dawn. It is our job to protect this intermediary of people's prayers.
 7693: This is the gateway to Heavens Tower that serves as the political centaru of our town. The meeting of the five ministries has ended, so you are free to entaru the tower if you wish.
 7694: Cross this bridge and follow the path to reach-a-weach the entrance of Windurst's residential area.
 7695: In the residential area's Mog Houses and Rent-a-Rooms, you can put-a-wut important belongings into safekeeping or just store-a-wore away items that are getting in your way. These can be very convenient facilities if you make good use-a-wuse of them.
 7696: If you hear of any useful news-o, pass it onto me, won't ya? I'm hoping to give up this guard-o gig-o and try my hand at a spot of adventurin' meself.
 7697: It's just that lately, I hear reports from all over the place-o that the beastmen are on the move again. Come to think of it, perhaps it's not the right time-o to be either a guard-o or an adventurer, is it then!?

 7708: Hello. I am Esmeralda. I am the consul of the Consulate of Jeuno in Windurst.
 7709: Windurst and Jeuno formed an amicable alliance twenty years ago at the end of the Great War. It is for and on behalf of this alliance that we have consulates and embassies in each other's countries.
 7710: Our main function is to render assistance to citizens of Jeuno who encounter trouble in foreign lands. So, most of the people who visit here are from Jeuno.
 7711: As you are not a citizen of Jeuno, I assume this facility is of no immediate consequence to you.
 7712: It's been about ten years since I left Jeuno to come to Windurst. In that period, I haven't had much of a chance to prove myself.
 7713: This country is too easy-going, and it's begun to rub off on me. I can't let that happen anymore. It is my ambition that's made me what I am!
 7714: What is my ambition? Do you think I'd be so brash as to tell the likes of you?
 7715: Why don't you go first? Come on. Tell us all what your ambitions are!
 7716: What do you mean, where is Jeuno? Haven't you ever seen a current map of the known world up till now?
 7717: The Grand Duchy of Jeuno is midway between the continent of Mindartia and the continent of Quon. How could you overlook a country that is in the middle of the map?
 7718: Sure, compared to a country like Windurst, the history of Jeuno is really short, but...
 7719: Hey! Are you trying to be sarcastic in order to put Jeuno down? If that's what you're doing, then we won't let you off easy, you know?
 7720: Are you surprised that Consul Esmeralda is so young? That is because in Jeuno, we have the tendency to rapidly promote able young people.
 7721: Now is an era of great change. In such times as this, new ideas and vigor are essential.
 7722: We believe knowledge and experience are impotent without youthful energy. When youths are knocked down, they can stand up again. They can run at full speed toward their goals. It is such energy that we, the younger generation, have in abundance.
 7723: This is the entrance to Windurst's residential area, where there is a "Mog House" prepared for your use, taru.
 7724: Hey... I haven't told you about Mog Houses before, have I? Don't tell me you want me to explain it all to you, taru?
 7725: Listen to Mog House explanation? [Yes./No.]
 7726: A Mog House is your own personal apartment room provided for your convenience, taru.
 7727: Within your Mog House, you can store items, change jobs, heal your HP and MP, and so on, taru.
 7728: As you are a citizen of Windurst, you already have a Mog House prepared for you, beyond the entrance behind me, taru.
 7729: You are free to use the room as you please. Anyway, enough of my explanation. Go ahead and kupo-ing rest up, taru.
 7730: This is the entrance to Windurst's residential area where there is a "Mog House" prepared for your use, taru.
 7731: Hey... Don't tell me you want to hear my Mog House explanation again, taru?
 7732: Phew. Didn't want to put the both of us through that again, taru!
 7733: This is the entrance to Windurst's residential area, where there is a "Mog House" prepared for your use, taru.
 7734: Hey... You currently have a Rent-a-Room leased out in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Kazham/Rabao/Norg/Al Zahbi], right, taru?
 7735: I suppose you want me to return the Rent-a-Room in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Kazham/Rabao/Norg/Al Zahbi], and have all your belongings brought back from there to your Mog House here in Windurst for you, right, taru?
 7736: Move out of Rent-a-Room? [Yes./No.]
 7737: How typical! I knew you would make me do this...<Grumble-grumble>... There. The keys to your Rent-a-Room in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Kazham/Rabao/Norg/Al Zahbi] have been returned, and you are now free to kupo-ing rest in your Mog House here again, taru.
 7738: This is the entrance to Windurst's residential area, where there are Mog Houses and Rent-a-Rooms available for your use, taru.
 7739: Hey... You already have a Rent-a-Room leased here at the moment, right? Well then, you are free to go in and use the Rent-a-Room as you would your Mog House back in your own country, taru.
 7740: This is the entrance to Windurst's residential area, where there are Mog Houses and Rent-a-Rooms available for people's use, taru.
 7741: Hey... You're no citizen of Windurst! That means you can only lease a Rent-a-Room, taru.
 7742: When you lease a Rent-a-Room here, you can use it as you would use your own personal Mog House back in your home country, taru. All the convenience of home, right here in ol' Windurst, taru.
 7743: Lease a Rent-a-Room? [Yes./No.]
 7744: Damn, I knew you'd make me do more paperwork... <Sigh> There... You now have your own Rent-a-Room prepared for your use in Windurst's residential area behind me here, taru. Have a kupo-ing nice stay.
 7745: You were sent here by my editor-weditor? Oh, gee...I haven't been able to get the lowdown on old Doctor Shantotto yet!
 7746: We'll just have to run with what I've got-wot... Here, take this article back to the boss for me.
 7747: Getting back to the matter at hand-wand... How should I break the ice with Doctor Shantotto?
 7748: "I hope you're having a magical day-way?" ...Naw! "Thank you for sparing me your precious time-wime?" ...Nagh! Curses! What will become of me...?
 7749: ...Erck...!
 7750: My, my news s-scoop...? H-here...erck...t-take th-this...
 7751: ...Erck...!
 7752: S-some-b-body h-help m-me`!
 7753: Ergh... Why, diddly-doodley, do you bother me? I was just chasing a white rabbit deep down into its burrow, too...
 7754: Ho-hoo! Are these the School of Magic's exam paper-reenos you have there-diddly-ere? Let me looky-loo... Ah, a black-whack-dackidly-dack magic test, eh? What's that-aroo? A monster-ino had them after they were stolen from the staff room-a-boom-boom?
 7755: So that's why they are so tattery-splat-dattery! Well, you've brought them to the right person-eroony. I can grade these and fill-a-in the teacher's results table in an instant-aroo!
 7756: Miss Kirarara... 100%!
 7757: Master Mashuu-Ajuu... 96%!
 7758: Miss Akkeke... 77%!
 7759: Master Foi-Mui... 81%!
 7760: Miss Koko Lihzeh... 65%!
 7761: Miss Rukuku... 88%!
 7762: Master Chomoro-Kyotoro...
 7763: Hmm? Oh, my-diddly-die. Master Chomoro-Kyotoro's seems to be missing-aroo.
 7764: My dear adventurer-ino. Can you go diddily-doddely back to the School of Magic and tell the teacher, Ms. Fuepepe, to make young Master Chomoro-Kyotoro take the test again-amain?
 7765: Oh, and also give-aroo Chomoro-Kyotoro this from me. Tell him he must hold-eroony on to it until he graduates from the School of Magic.
 7766: Off with you, now-arino. Can't you see I'm busy-a-wizzy? Oh, so biddily-boddily busy.
 7767: What's that-a-wat? Exam paper-inos from the School of Magic? Looks like the answer sheets to a black magic test-aroo to me.
 7768: If that's the case, then you should probably diddily-doddly take them to Ms. Fuepepe at the school-eroony.
 7769: The doors are firmly sealed shut.
 7770: You can feel a strange power. Perhaps it is better not to open the doors.
 7771: Ahoy! Ahoy!
 7772: I was able to make some pretty cool stinky-bombs with the $1 you brought us!
 7773: Star Onion Brigade, attentio`n! "Operation Onion" will now begin!
 7774: The trap is set, and we're all in position! Now all we have to do is wait for the Cat Burglar to show!
 7775: Oi! Whoever's in charge of candy provisions! How about you deal out some candy now?
 7776: Oopsy-daisy!
 7777: You idiot! You're pushing for a dishonorable discharge from the Star Onion Brigade for forgetting your candy responsibilities!
 7778: Shhh...! Everyone quiet! She's coming!
 7779: Wait till you see the whites of her eyes, then let her have it with our onion stinky-bombs!!!
 7780: Three!
 7781: Two!
 7782: One!
 7783: Bombs away!
 7784: Everybody, CHAAAAARRRGE!
 7785: Yippee!
 7786: Hi-ho Silver!
 7787: Up and at 'em!
 7788: Herrre we go again!
 7789: Meow!
 7790: (I think we knocked her out...!)
 7791: (Good. Now let's quietly approach her and tie her up with our ropey-rope!)
 7792: Ooo`h!
 7793: <cough> <cough> Grrr... Pe-ew! Wh-what hit me?
 7794: Not you S.O.B.'s again! What in blazes did you do that for?
 7795: Boy, am I going to get you!!!
 7796: Grrrowl!!!
 7797: Waaa`rgh!
 7798: Run for your li`ves!
 7799: Oh, the Cat Burglar got away...
 7800: ...but she dropped a pretty little ball.
 7801: I wonder if everyone will get angry with me if I take it?
 7802: Ahoy! Ahoy!
 7803: Good! Now that we're all here, it's time for the final showdown with that Cat Burglar!
 7804: Star Onion Brigade, are you ready already? Then CHAAAA`RRGE!
 7805: Ta-da`! The Star Onion Brigade is on the scene!
 7806: Nanaa Mihgo! Otherwise known as the Cat Burglar! We're on your tail now!
 7807: We're not letting you out of here until you promise to give up your evil ways for good!
 7808: Not you brrrats again! Don't you have betterrr things to do all day than to rrrub my furrr the wrrrong way?
 7809: Bite your tongue! We're very busy-wusy fighting crime, you know?
 7810: We're the ones who solve all of Windurst's problems that grown-ups turn a blind eye to!
 7811: Oh, you'd betterrr be carrreful then. Sounds like you'rrre making me out to be some kind of baddy, or something?
 7812: If you're out to stop baddies, then you should be chasing after the Minister of the Orastery, Ajido-Marujido, not me! He's the one to watch, you know?
 7813: Huh? Is that true?
 7814: Don't ask me! I don't know...I don't pay much attention to wumors.
 7815: Then allow me to fill you in. The ministerrr of the Orastery is trying to revive "summoning magic"--the verrry magic that the Star Sibyl has forrrbidden.
 7816: That evil little magician is abusing his authorrrity as ministerrr and acting out of line. But because he's a ministerrr, the Tarutaru grrrown-ups let him do as he pleases.
 7817: Is this the kind of thing the Starrr Onion Brrrigade can allow to happen?
 7818: ......
 7819: Perrrhaps you had betterrr learn morrre about the ways of grrrown-ups beforrre you go too farrr. The adult worrrld isn't as simple as your children's worrrld is...
 7820: See you arrround, I suppose!
 7821: Did the door just lock...?
 7822: We've been had!
 7823: Grrr... We've been shut in!
 7824: A-ha-ha! If you don't hurrrry up and learn the ways of grrrown-ups, you'll meet worrrse fates than this! I hope this has prrroven to be a valuable lesson!
 7825: Goodbye, my little kittens! This house is enchanted, so no matterrr how much noise you make, no one will everrr hearrr you!
 7826: I hope the ghost of the summonerrr doesn't eat you! Farrrewell!
 7827: Did she say "g-ghost"!?
 7828: ......

 7830: E-e-e-every-one re-m-m-main c-c-calm!
 7831: Th-there's no-no-no s-s-such th-things as g-ghosties! The C-cat Burglar is j-just trying t-to s-scare us!
 7832: Th-there's got to be a perfectly reasonable explanation for this! L-let's check out where the s-sound came from...e-everyone!
 7833: Looky-see... There's a gap behind this bookshelf!
 7834: The sound we heard was just the wind blowing in from there...
 7835: Phew...
 7836: Don't scarrre us like that!
 7837: So da ghosty's twue identity was just da wind!
 7838: It's pwetty dark and hard to tell, but if dere are a lot of gaps in da walls, den dey might give us a clue to get out of here!
 7839: Arrrrrgggghhhyaaaa!!!
 7840: Dere's a c-c-corpse!
 7841: A corpse!
 7842: A corpse!?
 7843: You mean ath in...a dead body!?
 7844: No, Pichichi! Keep back! It's too dangerous!
 7845: But a dead body ith not dangerouth, ith it?
 7846: I, erh, guess not...but a ghosty may come out of it!
 7847: But a ghothty ith an undead body, not a dead body, right?
 7848: Um... Either way, I don't think it's wise to find out!
 7849: Ah...!
 7850: Huh...?
 7851: Wo-wo-wo-wo-whoah!
 7852: Wee! He came back to life again!
 7853: ......?

 7862: Yet another close call for the Star Onion Brigade!
 7863: I thought we were goners when we were twapped in dere with dat ghosty!
 7864: But it was no ghosty-whosty, it was a Cardiany!
 7865: So ghosties don't rrreally exist! Now that's a rrrelief!
 7866: But it was still frightening enough! I swearrr my tail has shrrrunk an ilm!
 7867: And thanks to Joker, we were able to escape!
 7868: Well, that was more than enough adventure for today... Let's all head back to Star Onion headquarters at the port.

 7878: Come on! Hurry up!
 7879: ......!
 7880: These dolly-wollies with the starfruit heads are called Cardians.t
 7881: Cardians come from the Great Star Tree, so they speak the language of the stars!t
 7882: Hullo-wullo! Are you from Windurst yourselfy-welfy? Or are you just another adventurer passing throughy-woughy?
 7883: Either way, it's a dangerous place outside of this towny-wowny. If you intend on venturing outside, then you had better make sure your armor and weapons are properly equipped firsty-wirsty!
 7884: Welcome to the magical town of Windurst.t Home of fun-loving Tarutaru and free-willed Mithra.
 7885: You are now in Windurst Walls. It's a holy site revered by us Tarutaru since ancientaru times. I hope you enjoy your visitaru here.
 7886: According to Principal Koru-Moru, there was once a great beasty that occasionally appeared in Sarutabaruta and ate any Tarutaru who happenedy to wandery by.
 7887: I'm sure gladdy I livey in an age when such beasties no longer existy!
 7888: You're not a childy anymore, so stop behaving like a spoiled bratty! I refuse to recognizey your notice of retirementy, Principal Koru-Moru!
 7889: All the othery ministers have already gatheredy at Heavens Towery! So pleasey come outy, Principal Koru-Moru!
 7890: Professor Koru-Moru, the old minister who lives in that manor there, is more famous for being the local ding-a-ling than for serving as the School of Magic's principal! I just know he's up to something in there!
 7891: I came over to call in and have a little chitchat, but it seems as if he is, how shall we say...otherwise occupied...?
 7892: Windurst Walls is the coolest-woolest place. Not only do we have Heavens Tower and a consulate, but all the ex-ministers have manors here!
 7893: When the ministers of the five magic ministries of Windurst retire, they gain the title of doctor or professor, and are allowed to live in special-wecial houses so they can continue their studies without worries.
 7894: Oh, no! That old gent those groupies call the "Great Teacher" has started up his speech again. I swear, my ears are suffering from repetitive strain injury from listening to him repeat the same old thing every time I have the misfortune of passing by here.
 7895: The great summoner Karaha-Baruha is the savior of Windurst. Just when we were completely surrounded by beastmen and faced certain doom, BAM!, he instantaneously blew them all away.
 7896: If it weren't for him, we Windurstians would have all been goners! A summoner is really someone, huh?
 7897: I hear that the beastmen are on the move in every region lately. Even though Windurst has amicable relations with our local beastmen, the Yagudo, we still can't be sure if or when we are going to get pulled back into a full-scale war.
 7898: That we can now live here in peace...under the blessed shadow of the Great Star Tree...is all thanks to the great hero, Karaha-Baruha...!
 7899: Let the name of the great hero, Karaha-Baruha, not be forgotten! May we exalt the name of Karaha-Baruha on high!
 7900: Our Federation of Windurst is governed-woverned by the great Star Sibyl and the five ministries of magic.
 7901: Major decisions are made by the five ministers who head the ministries, but the divinations of the Star Sibyl are the most important determinant.
 7902: It was a courageous decision by the Star Sibyl when she set out to make friends with the beastmen. It was because of her actions that we are now able to restore Windurst to the beautaruful place it once was.
 7903: Glory to Windurst! Glory to the great Star Sibyl! May this peace continue for ever and ever!
 7904: That place called Giddeus where all them Yagudo beastmen live and dwell is downright dangerous! If you take one wrong step, then it's bishy-bashy, cracky-whacky, and crunchy-munchy!
 7905: Come on! The beastmen have been fighting and slighting with Windurst for hundreds of years! How can anyone expect them to suddenly become all cute-and-cuddly or lovey-dovey?
 7906: The Star Sibyl permitted the Yagudo beastmen to live in Sarutabaruta. Thataru's why there is a Yagudo nest called Giddeus out in West Sarutabaruta.
 7907: But the Yagudo don'taru seem the least bit thankful. Annoying, isn'taru it?
 7908: Why are there so many hot-blooded Mithra? They shouldn't worry so much about winning or losing-wosing.
 7909: What's done is done. Don't you think-wink that it's better to forget the past and concentrate on improving your relationships with others now?
 7910: Doctor Shantotto, the former Minister of the Orastery, or "Mage Academy," lives in this house here. I'm sure that she's hiding something-womething!
 7911: Who am I? Well, I'm the reporter who's waiting to get a tell-all interview with her! You see, I write for the Tarutaru Times' "Magic Paradise Weekly."
 7912: They say old Doc Shantotto's as high-and-mighty as Yutungah's firey mountain, and as rough-cut as the rocky Gustaberg Ranges-wanges.
 7913: I guess it was wrong of me to start off by interviewing the people around her. The more I hear about the doctor, the less I want to meet her-wer.
 7914: That building up there-o-ere is a foreign country's consulate. There is an agreement between Windurst and the other countries that they help each other out when they are in trouble-o-rouble.
 7915: So I don't see why we need-o-eed consulates or embassies. If someone is in trouble, we should be helping them out regardless of whether they are Windurstian or not-o-wot!
 7916: I feel so sorry for nasty old Zonpa-Zippa's daughter, Miss Apururu. With a father like thaty-watty, not to mention that horrible-worrible brother of hers...! Well, it just goes to show that you suffer-wuffer your whole life when you come from a bad family.
 7917: The professor thataru lived in this manor was kidnapped several years ago by those automaton guard creations of his that he named "Cardians." No one's heard anything of him since the day he was spirited away.
 7918: But it serves him rightaru, as that professor was the biggest liar Windurst ever knew. He's probably in the stomach of some nut-headed Cardian by now...or at leastaru one can hope.
 7919: We lost all too many-wany loved ones during the Great War, two decades ago.
 7920: However, the Great Star Tree and the Star Sibyl survived unharmed, so we Windurstians were able to rebuild our lives without losing all hopey-wopey.
 7921: The Star Tree is like a guardian angel-wangel, who, together with the Star Sibyl, looks after Windurst and the Tarutaru who dwell herey-werey.
 7922: My heart feels at peacey-weacey whenever I pray to the Great Star Tree, as I am doing now.
 7923: Have you ever heard-weard about the great summoner, Karaha-Baruha, who saved Windurst twenty years back?
 7924: See the empty house on the hill here? That's the manor where the genius-wenius was supposed to live after he retired as Minister of the Optistery. The town's children think it's haunted-waunted and call it the "ghosty house."
 7925: Whataru? Don'taru tell me someone is searching for us already? Oh...? Phew...! Don'taru you dare tell head lady-in-waiting Zubaba about it, butaru, we sortaru of snuck outaru of Heavens Tower for a bitaru.
 7926: Lately the Star Sibyl's divinations have been a little off the marky-warky. Of coursey-woursey, this has put the head lady-in-waiting in rather a bad mood, to say the leasty-weasty. It's simply dreadful-weadful!
 7927: My dream is to become a lady-in-waiting and serve the Star Sibyl, but I keep getting turned down by the head lady-in-waiting every time I ask for an interview. How dare she keep me waiting like this with those silly excuses of hers!
 7928: Flibbertigibbet, my word! What's wrong with a little gossiping, anyway? Actually, I think my spreading of information is a vital community service. Wouldn't you agree?
 7929: Gee... May the Goddess help us if a gossiper-wossiper like Ms. Mehruru ever became-ewame a lady-in-waiting. There'd be no secrets-wecrets left in Heavens Tower-wower!
 7930: The Star Reading ceremony is a special rite that entails the gathering of the five ministers and the Star Sibyl together to listen-wisten to the will of the stars in the skies above. The last Star Reading said that Windurst would have everlasting peace-weace.
 7931: I'm just glad-wad we didn't have an ill-boding omen come up, like the ones we got during the Great War twenty years ago.
 7932: Ithn't it biggy-wiggy? Ithn't it hugey-wugey? Can you thee it? Can you thee it? That'th the "Great Thtar Tree" that grew-and-grew out of and all over Heaventh Tower!
 7933: It grew thith big thankth to the magical blething of the thtars in the thky! I with they would help me grow up big thoon too!
 7934: Sorry-dorry! I'm in the middle of escorting a researcher from the Rhinostery's bio lab around here. But gee-weez, I sure wish he didn't have to come at such a busy time as this. <mumble-grumble>
 7935: Hmm... Tsk-tsk... This is more serious-derious than I thought-dought...
 7936: ...Ah? ...Oh! ...Huh? If you're looking-dooking for the entrance to Heavens Tower, it's on the other side-dide of this poor old star tree that encases it.
 7937: After years of trying, I was finally given the privilege of serving the Star Sibyl, but I gotaru fired for being too clumsy and a scatterbrain.
 7938: Now I don'taru know whataru to do-woo! How can I ever face my mother and father, my brothers and sisters, or my grandfather or grandmother ever again? Oh, and then there's my cousins and my friends, and my family's friends, and their friends' friends and...
 7939: Come on, Professorrr Koru-Moru. I'm not moving until you cough up the gil forrr yourrr overdue accounts at the Boneworkers' Guild. As both a ministerrr and the principal of our local school, shouldn't you be setting a betterrr example?
 7940: If you need to enter Heavens Tower, then you'll have to crrross that bridge over there. Look around you, and you'll realize that the ruins of the once-grrreat walls of Windurst are prrractically filled with water.
 7941: It was twenty years ago, during the Grrreat War, when the walls were destroyed and the place became flooded. But betterrr to have an abundance of waterrr than none at all, eh?
 7942: When I was just a kitten, the Star Sibyl came out and gave a speech to everrrybody.
 7943: She said two things: that we should all play nice with the beastmen, and that nobody could use summonimoning magic anymorrre. What's summonimoning magic?
 7944: I'm looking for baddie-waddies. When I catch 'em, I throw 'em in a scary-wary jail.
 7945: You're not doing anything bad, are you? If you are, you have to tell me, you know!
 7946: I'm sure you've seen the automaton guards positioned all around Windurrrst. You had better take carrre when dealing with those Cardians.
 7947: This is just between you and me, but those machines go crrrazy sometimes. I've even heard that there have been Tarutaru kidnapped by the malfunctioning Carrrdians!
 7948: <Hiss!> Get out of herrre.
 7949: We kids keep our tails out of you adults' business, so you keep your big noses out of ourrrs!
 7950: Not only the Star Sibyl lives in Heavens Towerrr. Her ladies-in-waiting and the Mithra Sibyl Guards also serrrve her there.
 7951: Out of all the guards protecting the Star Sibyl, Semih Lafihna is the most powerrrful. And why shouldn't she be? She is the only Mithra worrrthy enough to accept our chieftainness's bow.
 7952: I came herrre to give that Star Sibyl a piece of my mind! Why do we have to be frrriends with those filthy Yagudo?
 7953: They continue rrravaging the countryside just because no one herrre in Windurst has the guts to stand up to them!
 7954: Twenty yearrrs ago, the allied forrrces succeeded in defeating the lord of the beastmen. Howeverrr, they were not able to take the beastman forces out completely.
 7955: If Windurst had only a little more powerrr then, we could have taken care of our birrrd problem, and there would be no need to fake a happy coexistence with the Yagudo.
 7956: Gnyah ha ha! What a mighty queer country this here Windurst is! The people are smaller than dogs and the trees are as big as mountains.
 7957: And that big honkin' thing over yonder... They say that some star-lady is all living up in there. I wonder if she's into sophisty-cated guys like yours truly.
 7958: It's just lovely here, away from the smoke and bustle of Bastok. Take a deep breath and smell that fresh air.
 7959: Whenever I need to relax, I just kick back and take in the scenery.
 7960: I heard from that consulate over there that Windurst has formed a peace pact with the Yagudo.
 7961: Can you believe it? Have they already forgot what happened twenty years ago?
 7962: Hmm... I was just talking to Aromu-Oromu here about the Windurstian government.
 7963: Can you believe that all the goings-on in this country are decided by the Star Sibyl's fortune-telling? They say that it's tradition, but I just don't see the logic in it...
 7964: Howdy-dowdy! You're in Windurst Walls, [buddy/missy]. I can warp you to Port Windurst if you want me to!
 7965: Warp to Port Windurst? [Yes./No.]
 7966: Have you already been inside Heavens Tower? I came all the way here to see this strange spring inside. They say you can see the stars in it.
 7967: The Star Reading ceremony is a special rite that entails the gathering of the five ministers and the Star Sibyl together to listen-wisten to the will of the stars in the skies above.
 7968: The last few years' Star Reading-weadings didn't say much either way...neither good omens, nor bad.

 7996: You're on a mission from the Optistery? Oh, so you're the foolhardy adventurer who accepted that one.
 7997: Do you really think that the Book of the Gods could actually fall into the hands of that petty thief, the Cat Burglar?

 7999: Wait a minutaru... This mark...
 8000: The pages...they're blank...!
 8001: It can'taru be... The time for the Book of the Gods to lose its magic has come...
 8002: You! You must hurry back to the Optistery!
 8003: Tell Tosuka-Porika that the pages of the Book of the Gods have turned blank. Tell him the Book of the Gods is no more!

 8007: Welcome to the auction house. Do you have any questions about our establishment?
 8008: What do you want to know? [What is the auction house?/How are auctions run?/Are there any fees?/Are there any limits?/How do you check up on merchandise?/How do you remove an item?/My "Sales Status" list is full!/Nothing right now.]
 8009: Auction houses can be found in all of Vana'diel's major cities. Here adventurers gather to bid on battle spoils, unwanted items, old armor...almost anything.
 8010: Currently, the auction houses in Bastok, San d'Oria, Windurst, and Jeuno all work independently. Therefore, prices differ from city to city.
 8011: Adventurers may use any auction house regardless of nationality.
 8012: The first adventurer to bid at or above the asking price will automatically purchase the product.
 8013: Once put up for auction, merchandise will remain there for a maximum of thirty weeks Vana'diel time (nine-and-a-half days Earth time).
 8014: If merchandise does not sell within this time limit, it will be returned to the seller's current residence.
 8015: Transaction fees are proportional to the amount for which an item is put up on auction. The method of calculating this fee is different for single items and stackable items.
 8016: A transaction fee is collected when any merchandise is put up for auction. This fee is nonrefundable.
 8017: The International Auction House Committee, or IAHC, has declared that a maximum of seven items may be put up for auction at one time.
 8018: However, the IAHC has recently removed the limit to how many items one may purchase.
 8019: A small amount of time is required before new merchandise appears on our bid list.
 8020: Once an item appears on your "Sales Status" list, it may not immediately appear on the bid list. If you do not see your item on the bid list, try looking again at a later time.
 8021: If you would like to withdraw an item from an auction, you must travel to the auction house, and select "Stop Sale" from the "Sales Status" menu.
 8022: To remove an item from your "Sales Status" list, you must visit an auction counter to acknowledge the sale or return of your merchandise.
 8023: Otherwise, previously sold or returned items will fill up your list and prevent you from selling any more merchandise.
 8024: At any auction counter, open the "Sales Status" menu and acknowledge the transaction to clear it from the list.
 8025: Press the confirm button to remove any transaction colored yellow (sold) or red (returned).
 8026: Is there anything else you would like to know?
 8027: In the past, many have amassed great wealth through the auction house. I hope you find fortune, too!
 8028: You receive nothing from the moon rabbit...
 8029: The moon rabbit has brought along a monster!
 8030: You have to do something about those crazy trees, kupo!
 8031: You're done fighting trees, kupo?

 8061: Sleeping on that $3 has made me homesick, kupo. Will my benevolent master give [his/her] moogle some time off to visit with Mama and Papa Moogle, kupo?
 8062: Give your moogle a vacationH [Sure, kupo! /No, your time is mine!]
 8063: Oh, what a cruel, cruel master, kupo!!!
 8064: Thank you, kupo! I...have one more favor to ask. It's almost time for the festival in the moogles' hometown, kupo!
 8065: Papa Moogle will be entering the archery contest, so I want to bring him $5 as a gift, kupo!
 8066: Mama Moogle always likes to dress up for the occasion, and $6 would make the perfect present, kupo!
 8067: But I have no idea how to go about finding $5 or $6, kupo... I can't go home empty-handed, kupo...
 8068: Papa Moogle will be entering the archery contest, so I want to bring him $5 as a gift, kupo!
 8069: Mama Moogle always likes to dress up for the occasion, and $6 would make the perfect present, kupo!

 8074: Here's your present--a shiny new Mog Safe, kupo! Now you can store as many as 60 items, kupo!
 8075: Looking at that shabby old bed makes me feel homesick, kupo. Will my benevolent master give [his/her] moogle some time off to visit with Mama and Papa Moogle, kupo?
 8076: Master, Master! I have a favor to ask, kupo!
 8077: Sleeping on that $3 has made me homesick, kupo. Will my benevolent master give [his/her] moogle some time off to visit with Mama and Papa Moogle, kupo?

 8079: Thank you, kupo! I have one more favor to ask... I want to take my family on a picnic, kupo!
 8080: Papa Moogle is mad for fishing, so I want to give him $5, kupo!
 8081: Mama Moogle would bake a scrumptious mooglepie to take with us, but she'd need $6, kupo!
 8082: But...I haven't the foggiest idea of how to get either of these things, kupo... Whatever am I to do, kupo?
 8083: Papa Mog is mad for fishing, so I want to give him $5, kupo!

 8092: After resting on the $3, I noticed a letter had arrived from some old moogle friends, kupo! Will my magnanimous master give me some time off to go visit my old buddies?
 8093: Give your moogle some time off? [Have fun, kupo!/No, I am your only friend now!]
 8094: Oh, thank you, master! My moogle friends live across the seas, so I have another favor to ask you, kupo!
 8095: The sun beats down mercilessly in the land beyond the west sea, so I need to take $5 for my friends there, kupo!
 8096: And my other buddies need $6 for the torrential rains that scour the lands across the east sea, kupo!
 8097: I can't help out my friends if I don't have $5 and $6, kupo...
 8098: I'll be sure to bring you a souvenir from my overseas trip, kupo! See you in a few days, master!
 8099: Master! I'm back from visiting my old moogle friends, kupo!
 8100: We all got together and made you a new Mog Safe, kupo! Now you can store as many as 80 items, kupo!
 8101: Ah, it's you again, my dear. And to tell you the truth, I'm glad you're here.
 8102: Right now I am looking for someone who can do me a favor... Namely, anyone who can manage to reach the Beaucedine Glacier.
 8103: Do you have a friend who is a black mage? One worthy of meeting me, the "Great Sage"?
 8104: Introduce a black mage friend to her? [Of course!/Ask if you're worthy.]
 8105: When you see that friend, tell them to hurry. There is no need for you to accompany them, so please don't worry.
 8106: Now, off with you, dear, my schedule is very tight. Ohoho-whoo! I have no time to waste changing the diapers of total losers like you.
 8107: Yo`u!?
 8108: Ohohohohoho! A marvelous joke! Ohoho! You adventurers are such amusing folk!
 8109: The place is terrible, as far as I can tell. From the beasts to the weather, the Northlands are a snow-white hell.
 8110: It's a place where an onion adventurer like you could perish, and you probably would. So, go on home now, and act like a total loser should.
 8111: Act like a total loser should? [Yes, mommy./Whatchu talkin' 'bout Shantotto?]
 8112: Ohoho! Well, I expected you to step back and cower. But, I guess I will put a little faith into your loser power.
 8113: You know of those magic towers in Sarutabaruta? Well, the Beaucedine Glacier has some, too. Go there and you will find researchers working with the Rhinostery minister, Rukususu.
 8114: I want you to ask her something, if you'd be so kind. Please inquire if that new magic of mine is working fine.
 8115: Oh, and one more thing I'd like you to tell her before you come back to Windurst... Tell her if she doesn't reply soon, she'll find herself cursed.
 8116: Ohoho! Rukususu is terrified of onions and ghosts. So, I'll conjure up a curse with the things she hates the most.
 8117: Ohoho! I am so evil!
 8118: You know of those magic towers in Sarutabaruta? Well, the Beaucedine Glacier has some, too. Go there and you will find researchers working with the Rhinostery minister, Rukususu.
 8119: I want you to ask her something, if you'd be so kind. Please inquire if that new magic of mine is working fine.
 8120: Oh, and one more thing I'd like you to tell her before you come back to Windurst... Tell her if she doesn't reply soon, she'll find herself cursed.
 8121: Dear, did you come to apologize for your failure?
 8122: Ohoho! My new curse will work just as fine on you, I'm sure.
 8123: What is this you're saying? The tome vanishes after fighting the golems in Fei'Yin?
 8124: Those brutes don't know what a nuisance they're being!
 8125: By the way, I hate to admit it, er... But, you did fairly well...for a total loser.
 8126: So, how was Rukususu, the old air-head? For being deathly afraid of the undead, she's sure spent much time away from her Windurstian bed.
 8127: It must be the thought of getting revenge...I dread... for what happened to her professor, Iru-Kuiru, that drives her instead.
 8128: I guess I must present you with a reward for your deed. I will bestow upon you my special magic, which I'm sure you'll need.
 8129: Ohoho! This version should stand up to even the strongest golem magic.
 8130: Use it well, and maybe your days as a total loser won't be so tragic.
 8131: Ohoho! Have you been using my magic?
 8132: Use it well, and maybe your days as a total loser won't be so tragic.
 8133: I doubt a total loser like you would have noticed if it was true what they were saying... But I wonder if that magic tome really vanishes when you fight the golems in Fei'Yin...

 8288: (Meow meow meow meow...)
 8289: (Meow meow meow meow...)

 8291: But don't tell anyone, okay?
 8292: % looks very happy.
 8293: Secrett Secrett It's our little secret!t

 8295: Wow! I'll take this and plant it in the garden rrright now!
 8296: ... Umm, but I don't have anything to give you in returrrn.

 8308: You haven't forgotten about our business at the star tree, have you, you big lard?
 8309: Throw $2 into the aurora crevice in Xarcabard. Then, take the $1 that comes out to Chumimi... That isn't so hard.
 8310: Listen close, [Mister-arister/Miss-a-riss] Adventurer-wer-er. During the Great War twenty years ago-go, there was this Tarutaru researcher named Rasusu in Jeuno, y'know?
 8311: I want you to find-fiddily-ind her and tell her to return the $1 she has-a-was-waz. She'll know what you're flum-diddely talking about.
 8312: Then you take that $1 on over to Chumimi and tell-a-roo her you found-dillily-dood it under a rock somewhere.
 8313: Wowzer wowzy wow! I can't diddly-dant believe you found Rasusu! No, no, don't tell me. I don't diddly-don't want to know all the details.
 8314: Now all you have to do is scoot-dootily-doot over to the orchard in Heavens Tower and give that to Chumimi.
 8315: How many times must I inform you of your task? Go to Castle Zvahl, and find that magic doll, blast! It's probably in one of the rooms there, if you must ask.
 8316: And when you retrieve it, do not bring it to me, please. Take it straight to the Tarutaru in Heavens Tower who are raising the little star trees.
 8317: Hey! Hey-a-roo, you! Bring that $1 to my homely-home-ome!
 8318: If I'm right-a-roo, and I always am, there's no point-dointily-doint in you taking that to Chumimi.
 8319: This should fix the doll-doddily-do.
 8320: Well, your services are no longer needly-need-needed here. Why don't you go to Heavens Tower and try cheering up-a-roo-woo that worrywart Chumimi?
 8321: Good luck, [citizen/comrade]. I will bestow upon you your nation's Signet.
 8322: I cannot help you. You should go find a guard from your own country.
 8323: I cannot accept crystals from someone whose rank is still 1. I advise you to either keep them until your reach rank 2, or to use them in craftwork.
 8324: Since we are allied with San d'Oria...
 8325: Since we are allied with Bastok...
 8326: Since we are allied with Windurst...
 8327: I am sorry. I am too busy with other matters to be speaking with you.
 8328: Ah, you have brought us supplies. These will help us indeed. I thank you.
 8329: Hmm... These supplies you have brought us are too old to be of any use. We will dispose of them promptly. I do commend you for your effort. May you succeed next time.
 8330: You've earned conquest points!
 8331: You've received your nation's Signet. You are now taking part in your nation's conquest campaign!
 8332: I am %, a Temple Knight. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing San d'Oria's conquest campaign.
 8333: I am %, an Iron Musketeer. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Bastok's conquest campaign.
 8334: I am %, a War Warlock. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Windurst's conquest campaign.
 8335: What is your business? [Would you cast Signet on me?/I want to spend my conquest points./[I want to join the Expeditionary Force./Teleport me to the E.F. area.]/I want to quit the E.F./change my E.F./I want to go on a supplies quest./I have some questions.../Nothing, sorry to bother you.]
 8336: What do you wish to know about? [Nothing./Conquests./Conquest results./Donating crystals./Conquest points./The effects of controlling regions./Regions controlled by other nations./Regions under beastman control.]
 8337: All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call "conquests." You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.
 8338: Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.
 8339: Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.
 8340: So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.
 8341: Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control. They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.
 8342: Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.
 8343: Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.
 8344: So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike. We expect you to do your best to serve your country.
 8345: You can see the current state of conquests by selecting "Region Info" from the main menu. Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.
 8346: Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank. The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.
 8347: You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2. Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.
 8348: We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on. Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.
 8349: You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet. Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.
 8350: Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.
 8351: You also receive rank points for completing missions. Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.
 8352: You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests. Select "Region Info" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.
 8353: You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.
 8354: When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.
 8355: If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.
 8356: Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.
 8357: Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.
 8358: Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.
 8359: As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.
 8360: But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.
 8361: Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions. If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.
 8362: If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.
 8363: The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.
 8364: We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.
 8365: There is one outpost in each region. Select "Region Info" from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.
 8366: Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete. Now, choose which outpost you want to go to. We give different rewards for each region, so choose carefully.
 8367: Where do you wish to take the supplies? [@/@/@/@/@/The Ronfaure Region.[/ (Done)]/The Zulkheim Region.[/ (Done)]/The Norvallen Region.[/ (Done)]/The Gustaberg Region.[/ (Done)]/The Derfland Region.[/ (Done)]/The Sarutabaruta Region.[/ (Done)]/The Kolshushu Region.[/ (Done)]/The Aragoneu Region.[/ (Done)]/The Fauregandi Region.[/ (Done)]/The Valdeaunia Region.[/ (Done)]/Qufim Island.[/ (Done)]/The Li'Telor Region.[/ (Done)]/The Kuzotz Region.[/ (Done)]/The Vollbow Region.[/ (Done)]/The Elshimo Lowlands Region.[/ (Done)]/The Elshimo Uplands Region.[/ (Done)]/Tu'Lia.[/ (Done)]/@/The Tavnazian Archipelago.[/ (Done)]/@/@/@/@/@/@/@/Cancel.]

 8369: So be it. You have until the next conquest results announcement to complete this mission. Good luck.
 8370: We will dispose of those unusable supplies.
 8371: You can only undertake one supply mission per day. Come back later.
 8372: I am sorry. We seem to have a problem. Let me cancel it.
 8373: You do not need to donate any more crystals at your current rank. Speak to the guard at the gatehouse for further instructions.
 8374: Your rank points are full. We've added the excess to your conquest points. You do not need to donate any more crystals. Go to the gatehouse for further instructions.
 8375: Good work, citizen. We've awarded you rank points for the crystals you've donated.
 8376: You currently have $0 conquest points. Would you like to use them to purchase items?
 8377: Which item do you wish to purchase? [Common items (all ranks)./1000-pt. items (rank 1 required)."000-pt. items (rank 2 required)./4000-pt. items (rank 3 required)./8000-pt. items (rank 4 required)./16000-pt. items (rank 5 required)."4000-pt. items (rank 6 required)."2000-pt. items (rank 7 required)./40000-pt. items (rank 8 required)./48000-pt. items (rank 9 required)./56000-pt. items (rank 10 required)./Cancel.]

 8379: Currently there are no items available for that rank.
 8380: Due to its special nature, you can only purchase or recharge $2 once until the conquest results tally is performed. Also, you cannot purchase this item if a similar item is already in your possession.
 8381: It is possible to fully recharge $2 by trading it to one of your nation's guards, including outpost guards. One charge requires 50 conquest points.
 8382: It is possible to fully recharge $2 by trading it to one of your nation's guards, including outpost guards. One charge requires 100 conquest points.
 8383: It is possible to fully recharge $2 by trading it to one of your nation's guards, including outpost guards. One charge requires 200 conquest points.
 8384: During the time of the Great War, it was possible to have this item recharged in exchange for Allied Notes. From my understanding, that practice has recently become commonplace in the Near East. Though you'll be needing Imperial Standing credits if you wish to use the service there.
 8385: You do not possess the $1 [conquest point/conquest points] required to fully recharge the $0.
 8386: Please be aware that you can only purchase or recharge $0 once during the period between each conquest results tally.
 8387: The $0 is already fully charged.
 8388: Your $0 has received $2 [charge/charges] in exchange for $1 [conquest point/conquest points]. It is now fully recharged.
 8389: I will trade you $0 for your $1. May it serve you well.
 8390: You do not meet the requirements to purchase the $2.
 8391: Your rank is too low to purchase the $2.
 8392: You do not have enough conquest points to purchase the $2.
 8393: You cannot equip the $2. Do you still wish to proceed?
 8394: Your level is too low to equip the $2. Do you still wish to proceed?
 8395: You seem to be able to equip the $2. Do you wish to proceed?
 8396: Are you sure you want to purchase the $2?
 8397: Proceed? [Yes, purchase item./Cancel purchase.]
 8398: Proceed? [Yes, even though I can't equip it./Cancel purchase.]

 8402: Which service do you request? [Buy/Sell items./Teleportation./Nothing.]
 8403: Do you really wish to be teleported? [Yes./Teleport with gil./Teleport with conquest points./No.]
 8404: Welcome to the border shop! If you trade me unused equipment, I'll add their value to your country's region points!
 8405: It should please you to know that I now also deal in $0. Bigger pieces will earn you more points for your nation, and I'll even toss some gil into the equation!
 8406: I see that your home country has control of this region. Feel free to browse through my wares.
 8407: I see that your home country is allies with the country in control of this region. Feel free to browse through my wares.
 8408: I can teleport you to your home country for $1 gil or $3 conquest [point/points].
 8409: Word has it that the entire set of mog tablets has been recovered. Oh, happy day! In honor of the occasion, I can teleport you to your home country free of charge.
 8410: I am terribly sorry, but it seems as if you do not have enough gil.
 8411: I am terribly sorry, but it seems as if you do not have enough conquest points.
 8412: However, due to your home country's lack of influence in the region, this is the only transaction I am authorized to perform with you at the moment.
 8413: I am looking forward to doing business with you again in the future!
 8414: Thank you. This will increase your nation's region points by a small amount. If you have anything else, by all means, trade them to me.
 8415: Thank you. This will increase your nation's region points moderately. If you have anything else, by all means, trade them to me.
 8416: Thank you. This will increase your nation's region points greatly. If you have anything else, by all means, trade them to me.
 8417: I could not accept one or more items you tried to trade me. Please remove those items and try again.
 8418: Sorry. I can only take certain types of weapons, shields, or armor.
 8419: Thank you. This will increase your nation's region points [by a small amount/moderately/greatly]. For this transaction I will also furnish you with $0 gil.
 8420: My apologies, but this type of item needs to be individually appraised. Please trade them to me one at a time.
 8421: (DEBUG) Back to hometown!
 8422: What do you want? [Would you cast Signet on me?/I'd like to set my home point here./Nothing.]
 8423: What do you want? [Pay $7 gil and set my home point here./Nothing.]
 8424: Your home point has been set.
 8425: You do not have enough gil to set your home point here.
 8426: I will set your home point here.
 8427: We are currently on a beastman-purging campaign. We support adventurers from all nations. Do your best to rid the world of those vile creatures.
 8428: We are currently conducting an international exchange campaign. You may spend your conquest points to purchase items from foreign guards.
 8429: Thanks to you, our nation is now first in the conquest race! Here is a small token of our appreciation.
 8430: Adventurers from nations that are ranked higher than ours in the conquest race may purchase items from us, but at a higher rate.
 8431: You cannot currently purchase this item. Please choose another.
 8432: Currently our nation is dispatching Expeditionary Forces across Vana'diel, and requests the participation of brave adventurers such as yourself.
 8433: Requirements for participating in an E.F. are simple. Your party must consist of $5 members. Each member must be from this country, rank 3 or higher, and have reached a sufficient level.
 8434: Once your party is ready, come to me and I will teleport you to the nearest outpost.
 8435: There, you will receive an insignia of the Expeditionary Force. When you succeed in taking control of the area, you can exchange the insignia for your reward.
 8436: Join the E.F. in [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]? [Join the E.F./Not this time.]
 8437: Your party doesn't have enough members, or some of the members are not in this area. Gather all those who are participating and return here.
 8438: One of your party members is not a citizen of this country. We do not allow any foreign participants in the E.F.
 8439: One of your party members has not achieved rank level 3. We cannot reveal any of our tactical strategies to those who have not shown their loyalty to our country.
 8440: One of your party members is below level $6. For the safety of the adventurer and those accompanying him or her, we cannot allow anyone below the limit to participate in the E.F.
 8441: I see that you are ready. I grant you permission to join the current Expeditionary Force. When you are ready to teleport to the outpost, talk to me once more.
 8442: Are you ready to be teleported to [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]? Remember that party members who have not been granted permission to attend the E.F. will be left behind.
 8443: Teleport to [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]? [Ready!/Wait just a minute...]
 8444: Cancel your participation in the E.F. to [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]?
 8445: Quit the E.F.? [Yes./Change locations./No.]
 8446: Are you sure?
 8447: Really quit the E.F.? [Yes./No.]
 8448: I see. If you ever wish to participate in the future, I will be waiting here to take your application.
 8449: Your EF Badge vanishes!
 8450: Katsu-yaku pointos : $0!
 8451: This $3 is no longer valid. We will dispose of it here.
 8452: Your invalid ensignias have been disposed of.
 8453: Welcome back from the expedition. Our nation was successful in its campaign. Let me give you your reward.
 8454: You received $1 conquest points!
 8455: When participating in an Expeditionary Force, concentrate your efforts on fighting foes that give you the most experience points. And don't forget to confiscate the contents of any beastman treasure chest you happen to come upon.
 8456: I will now hand you your insignia. Be sure to read the inscription on the back before you begin your duties. Once Signet has been bestowed upon you, prepare to be teleported.
 8457: You could not be teleported. Ask me again, please.
 8458: The conquest results are currently being tallied. Come back later.
 8459: You have received permission to join the Expeditionary Forces!
 8460: Currently we rank first in Vana'diel's conquest, but that must not be taken for granted. We must continue our fight to remain on top.
 8461: We had first place in our hands, but we let it slip away. If we want to be ranked first in Vana'diel, each and every one of us must do their part. I look forward to hearing of your achievements.
 8462: Our country has fallen to third in the conquest of Vana'diel. We must step up our efforts to improve the situation.
 8463: You must fight in battles that gain high levels of experience. This is the only way we can bring areas under our country's control.
 8464: Currently, our country is the dominant force in this region. If we can maintain this level, control of this area will be ours.
 8465: Currently, our country is a major force in this region. However, we cannot take this for granted. If we let down our guard, we will surely lose control of the area!
 8466: Currently, our country has only minor influence in this region. We're counting on you to get us out of this hole we've dug ourselves into.
 8467: Currently, our country's influence in this area is minimal. If we do not act quickly, control of this region will certainly be taken by a rival country.
 8468: Take care when passing through, as this area is currently overrun with beastmen! Something must be done, or the enemy will have control of the entire region.
 8469: Your inventory is full. You could not accept the $0.
 8470: You already possess a gate glyph. You cannot hold any more.
 8471: I am Jeunoan Ducal Guard, %. My duty is to support the conquest efforts of Windurst, San d'Oria, and Bastok.

 8661: PAUSE
 8662: $1
 8663: You obtain three $0.
 8664: ...You...
 8665: ...<Player>...
 8666: You Are The One.
 8667: You are the star that shines in the center of the vortex of time.
 8668: I Have Been Waiting. The $1 You Carry...
 8669: I have been waiting here, ready to guide you. That $1 that you carry...
 8670: Incredible Force Remains Sealed Within That Gem.
 8671: An incredible force remains sealed within that tiny gem.
 8672: Gem Holds Power To Change Life From Within.
 8673: And that tiny gem holds the power to change your life from within.
 8674: It Is Calling You.
 8675: It is calling you.
 8676: Close Eyes And Open Heart.
 8677: Close your eyes...and open your heart...
 8678: Do Not Fear Voices. Accept And Become One With Them.
 8679: Do not fear the voices. Accept and become one with them.
 8680: Seek and gather...
 8681: ...the seven colors...
 8682: ...that cover the sky...
 8683: ...and embrace the earth...
 8684: Could You Hear? You Must Fulfill Its Wish.
 8685: Were you able to hear it? That voice believes you can fulfill its request.
 8686: When You Do, You Will See True Vana'diel... That Is When You Will Realize That You Are...
 8687: And when you do, you will see the true Vana'diel...and that is when you will realize that you are...
 8688: ...The Key...
 8689: ...the key...
 8690: ...!
 8691: What? Notaru you again!
 8692: Huh? Who are you?
 8693: Why do adventurers always have to go sticking their noses into places they don'taru belong?
 8694: Can'taru you see I'm busy here? I don'taru have any time for idle chit-chat. So why don'taru you make like the wind and...
 8695: Hm? What's that you've gotaru in your grubby little hands there?
 8696: Anything in your grubby hands? [Maybe.../Just dirt.]
 8697: Oi! I can tell a fib-meister when I see one. Open up your hands, young [man/lady]!
 8698: Oh, shutaru your trap and show me!
 8699: $1, you say? Well, this thing sure talks a lot to be an ordinary gem...
 8700: I'll let you in on a little secret. If you wantaru to know what it's saying, close your eyes and open your heart.
 8701: Let down your guard and accept all things and everything around you. Come on, now!
 8702: So? What did the gem have to say?
 8703: "Seek and gather the seven colors"? Well, at least it doesn't sound like a trap. And I'm not sensing a whole lot of energy from within this ruby, anyway.
 8704: But I need to tell you this--when you let down your guard to hear the voices around you, you should probably have a strong black mage by your side...just to be safe.
 8705: Those voices around you aren'taru always going to be weak ones like just now. You had better be careful. You won'taru always have me there to protect you!
 8706: Did you get all that, [Mister/Miss] Adventurer?
 8707: The voice from the $1 rings in your head.
 8708: ...The seven colors...
 8709: ...Seek and gather...the seven colors...that cover the sky...and embrace the earth...
 8710: <Pshoooooowaaaaa> I'm goood Goblin from underwooorld. I find lotshhh of gooodieshhh. You want try shhhome chipshhh? Cheap for yooou.
 8711: Kupipi was saying that there is no huge-luge difference between adventurers whose names go down in history, and those who are not mentioned at all-fall.
 8712: The only difference-mifference between them is that the adventurers whose names go down in history are the ones that remain in people's memories.
 8713: ...So, if it was you who we were talking about-pout, you would sorta be remembered. Vaguely.
 8714: This is justaruy between you and me, but... I saw an adventurer passing throughy the Priming Gate here in Windurst Walls.
 8715: The Cardian guard justaruy let him throughy without a wordy. I guess thataruy means he had permission from Heavens Tower. I don'taruy really know, thoughy.
 8716: I've been thinking that the Star Sibyl must have some kind of strrrategy in mind for dealing with those treacherous Yagudo.
 8717: This whole "Okay, here's your tribute!" facade is just a stalling tactic. Or at least, that's what I'd like to think.
 8718: The Minister of the Orastery, Ajido-Marujido, has issued a mission specifically for you.
 8719: I don'taru really like to say it, but... From where I stand, it looks as if he is in some sort of conflictaru with Heavens Tower.
 8720: You've acceptarued the mission and have to carry it out, but please be careful notaru step on anyone's toesy-wosies.
 8721: Minister Ajido-Marujido awaitarus you in the Orastery.
 8722: It's notaru my place to interfere, but... Please be careful notaru step on anyone's toesy-wosies.
 8723: Minister Ajido-Marujido has asked for you? My condolences. He really-deally bosses people around. The Ministers of the Orastery have always been meany-beanies.
 8724: Although with the members of the Mage Academy always on the front line of battle, I guess you gottaru be tough-rough or you couldn't cut it as the head honcho-poncho.
 8725: Minister Ajido-Marujido is notaruy as popular with the more hot-blooded Mithra as you would thinky.
 8726: Ajido-Marujido? Yeah, I know him. He's the one that's always looking for Nanaa Mihgo.
 8727: I don't want anything to do with lowlives who willingly deal with the Cat Burrrglar.
 8728: Ergh... Why, diddly-doodley, do you bother me? I was just cornering an evil wizard by the bank of a black stagnant pond...
 8729: Positively shocking. Did you hear aboutaru Minister Ajido-Marujido?
 8730: How many years has it been since someone was incarceratarued in the Dark Dungeon?
 8731: Apparentaruly, an adventurer was with Minister Ajido-Marujido when he was caughtaru.
 8732: Should that adventurer be sharing the blame, I wonder?
 8733: Anyway, leaving that talk aside, you have been summoned by the Star Sibyl.
 8734: Please proceed into Heavens Tower.
 8735: There is a summons for you from the Star Sibyl. Please proceed directaruly into Heavens Tower.
 8736: Will the adventurer who was with Minister Ajido-Marujido share his punishmentaru, I wonder?
 8737: The D-Dark D-Dungeon! Brrr, brrr, brrr!
 8738: I would rather becomey a guard in Windurst Woods than be throwny in there!
 8739: Even if he is Minister of the Orastery, Ajido-Marujido cannot be forgiven his transgressions. The word of Heavens Tower is the law of Windurst.
 8740: With Ajido-Marujido in the Dark Dungeon, who will become the next Minister of the Orastery? It will have to be a super-dooper wizard who can coordinate both the mighty-fighty War Warlocks and the Operations Division. ...Nobody really spring-pings to mind.
 8741: What did you just say? You wanna try rrrepeating that?
 8742: I've been hearing rumors from Miss Kupipi. Sounds like you've been through a tough time.
 8743: Luckily, this nextaru mission from the Optistery is a little easier. They wantaru you to help with tidying up the book vault, so it should be a walk in the park for you.
 8744: But to ask a rank seven adventurer to help them... It may be thataru there's more to this mission than meets the eye.
 8745: The Optistery has issued a mission for a book vault tidy-up. You've acceptarued missions from the Optistery before, haven'taru you?
 8746: They seem to have been impressed with you. It's very rare for the Optistery to ask for an adventurer by name.
 8747: I havetaru clean my house, too. Adventurers have it easy, since they have moogles to look after their rooms. I'm so jealous-bealous.
 8748: I've heard that if adventurers put furniture in their rooms, the moogles sometimes find hidden items. Lucky-duckies!
 8749: Have you heardy of the great genius Karaha-Baruha? Karaha-Baruha was the previous Minister of the Optistery.
 8750: In the northy of Windurst Walls you can find the House of the Hero. That is where the Ministers of the Optistery livey when they retirey. It's where Karaha-Baruha would have been livingy...
 8751: I was told a lot of stories about the Grrreat War as a child, but only those that centered on Chieftainness Perih Vashai.
 8752: Although I did hear a story that Windurst was saved by a grrreat light that flowed out from the magic towers. I wonder what could've caused that light?
 8753: Are you acquaintarued with Minister Rukususu of the Rhinostery? The nextaru mission is from her ministry.
 8754: All it says here is that the Rhinostery is looking for your help. Please ask Leepe-Hoppe on the second floor of the Rhinostery for the details of the mission.
 8755: They seem to be in a quite a fluster-wuster, so please hurry on over to the Rhinostery.
 8756: The Rhinostery is a research facility where they study all living things. They have a greataru number of researchers scattered all over Vana'diel carrying on various investigations.
 8757: It's a difficult field, but as Yoran-Oran always says, "There's nothing-ethy like the feeling of solving-ethy the world's little mysteries."
 8758: Were you listening properly-doperly? You need to go ask the mission-fission details from Leepe-Hoppe on the second floor of the Rhinostery.
 8759: The Rhinostery probably wants you to help them with their research... They usually have their own adventurers to assist-list them though.
 8760: Speaking of the Rhinostery, how's Miss Kerutoto?
 8761: From the time she was a tiny Tarutaru, Kerutoto would come outy with the most frighteningy things all of a sudden. Such a strange little poppet.
 8762: The Rhinostery? They have a long history with the Mithra.
 8763: Didn't you know? The first Tarutaru to visit us in our southern homeland were researchers from the Rhinostery.
 8764: Wowy-wow, you've reached rank eightaru already? Congratulations on your promotion.
 8765: Your nextaru mission has been issued by the Aurastery. Please ask the teachers at the School of Magic for the details.
 8766: This is a mission from the Aurastery, which basically means a mission from the School of Magic. Please talk to the teachers in the staff room.
 8767: Principal Koru-Moru resides in Windurst Walls, but... There probably wouldn't be much pointaru in asking him about the mission.
 8768: Out of the five ministries, the Aurastery issues the least mission-bissions.
 8769: When Professor Koru-Moru was actively performing his role as principal, there was all manner of trouble-bubbles... But these days it's been relatively quiet.
 8770: I never went to schooly. But with all my intense training-waining, I've become a top-notchy guard.
 8771: I've even made friends with this Mithra lady-wady. All as a result of my hard worky and discipline!
 8772: I've just given in. Every time I talk to these little Tarutaru, I just can't seem to keep the edge on my words. I've lost my bite completely.
 8773: Maybe I need to focus myself and rrredo my basic training...
 8774: Firstaru, I must get you to promise something. You can't say anything aboutaru this mission to anyone.
 8775: This is a mission from Minister Apururu of the Manustery, but it hasn't been submitted to the Sibyl Guards for approval.
 8776: It's not very likely that the Sibyl Guards would allow this mission to be issued... After a lengthy discussion-wussion amongst the gatehouse guards, we decided to keep it quiet from them for the sake of Minister Apururu.
 8777: Please make your way to the Manustery. Minister Apururu is waiting for you.
 8778: This is a mission from Minister Apururu of the Manustery. Please take care not to blabby-wab to anyone about it.
 8779: Please hurry to the Manustery and keep a look out for any Sibyl Guards sniffing around.
 8780: After the Great War twenty years ago, the Cardians started a rebellion-mellion and carried off the previous Manustery minister...
 8781: Following that chaos, the Manustery came to a complete standstill. Minister Apururu has worked extremely-zemely hard to get her ministry back into operation.
 8782: The Cardians created by the Manustery are made to act as shields for the guards. It's time we returned the favor!
 8783: Our biggest worry was Captain Rakoh Buuma in Windurst Woods. Being a Mithra, I didn'taru think she would understandy our desirey to help Minister Apururu.
 8784: But she was all for it! Now I think Mithra are the cat's pajamas!
 8785: I don't want to burst their bubble, but I think the reason Captain Buuma is helping the Tarutaru is because she wants to tick off the Sibyl Guards.
 8786: ...I Have Waited For You, <Player>.
 8787: I Know Why You Are Here. You Have Come To Take My Mana Orb.
 8788: It Is Normal For A Cardian To Die For His Master.
 8789: But I Am Not Willing To Die. Why Is That?
 8790: I Don't Know What It Is, But There Is Something I Must Do.
 8791: It Is Very Important. I Must Do This Thing Even If It Means Defying My Master.
 8792: ...Please Help Me Search For The Answer.
 8793: I Believe That Answer Will Be Found In Torai-Marai Canal.
 8794: Please Search Torai-Marai Canal In My Place. Find What I Am Looking For.
 8795: You give the $3 to Joker...
 8796: Yes... I understand now. I know who I am. I know why I am here.
 8797: I know that there is something I must do.
 8798: I must see. I must see what has become of Vana'diel.
 8799: And I must know. I must know what I need to do, and what path I need to take.
 8800: And so, <Player>, I cannot allow you to disassemble me as Honoi-Gomoi has asked you.
 8801: I offer this to you. I ask you to accept this from me and refuse the request from Honoi-Gomoi to take me apart.
 8802: Accept the offer? [When you put it that way.../The hammer or the axe?]
 8803: ...Please understand. If you try to carry out his request, then I must disassemble you. I ask you again, please just accept this.
 8804: ...<Player>. ...Thank you...
 8805: ...Hello? <Player>?
 8806: What are you doing here? This is the house of the great genius Karaha-Baruha. Well, to be perfectaruly accurate, this would have been his house...
 8807: Someone was saying they had seen a Cardian lurking around here, so I came to check it out for myself.
 8808: We can have a look around together! I'd feel much safer with a mighty-wighty adventurer like you to accompany me!
 8809: What's that you've got there?
 8810: It looks like one of the boxes used to store Cardians.
 8811: It must be one of the old Cardians if it's being kept here. I wonder if it's one of the models my father made twenty years ago...
 8812: Oh, there's something written here. Let's see now, "...to Toraimarai Canal..."?
 8813: Toraimarai Canal? Does that mean that the Cardian from this box has some connection with that place?
 8814: Adventurer, would you go and search Toraimarai Canal for me? You may be able to find some clues to solve this little mystery!
 8815: If you find anything even the leastaru bit strange I want you to bring it to me at the Manustery. I'm very curious-wurious about the events of twenty years ago!
 8816: If you find anything even the leastaru bit strange I want you to bring it to me at the Manustery. I'm very curious-wurious about the events of twenty years ago!
 8817: ...Hm? Just a momentaru. What's that you have there?
 8818: This is... This is a terribly-werribly old Cardian card...
 8819: But there's something strange about it. There's no mark, just this odd-bodd picture. I can't sense any magic from it, either.
 8820: How unusual. Ordinarily, Cardian cards are imbued with powerful magic.
 8821: The Cardian cards were a creation of my father, the previous Minister of the Manustery. The holder of the card could use it to remove the magic animating the card's respective Cardian.
 8822: Do you understand the ramifications of this? The older Cardians could use the cards in their possession to deactivate other Cardians.
 8823: ...My father had essentially made it possible for Cardians to kill each other, just like people can. Isn't that horrible-worrible...?
 8824: Ah, forgive me! I seem to have drifted onto a darker topic. Enough of that, back to this card!
 8825: This card holds no power over its respective Cardian. Which means it's most likely just a reject.
 8826: Either that...or it could be... This card has no respective Cardian? That would mean that this is a unique card...
 8827: <Player>, please let me buy this card off you! I'm sure there's more to this than meets the eye!
 8828: YoU$26hAVe aUthOR-iZat-iON$26FrOM$26rHinOsTEry?
 8829: IF$26aN Em-ERg-EncY$26liKE yOu$26SAy,$26SeVeN$26WiLL oPEn$26tHE gAtE$26fOR yOu.
 8830: Enter the Priming Gate? [Here we go.../Not just yet...]
 8831: ...Oh, $6! You have Rhinostery authorization-nation.
 8832: ...I heard aboutaru the theory that the withering-dithering of the Star Tree is caused by insects chewing-zewing on the roots.
 8833: We'll leave the extermination-termination of the bugs in your capable hands.
 8834: ...Yes, I heard-ethy the whole story from one of the young lads from the Rhinostery. Toraimarai Canal may be infested-ethy with starmites, he said.
 8835: That's my Rhinostery! Those young ones took-ethy fastaru and appropriataru action for the situation at hand. Coming to me for help-ethy was the right decision...
 8836: It's a critical situation, but working-ethy under pressure is one of the thrills of research, ha-ha-ha!
 8837: I'm making-ethy progress on my research into starmites, thanks in partaru to the information I had gathered-ethy on mandragoras. You see, all living things are connected.
 8838: You should-ethy remember this from time to time: You are connected-ethy to all other beings in Vana'diel.
 8839: Pass through the gate? [Yes./No.]
 8840: Enter the gate? [Yes./No.]
 8841: You said something!? You've collected all five of the minister rings!?
 8842: ...Well, well, well. I never believed you would actually get them all. Come on then, let's have a look at them, don't stall.
 8843: This $3 is worthless. It looks like $6 from an older age, more or less.
 8844: This mission will create quite a stir. We must involve Minister Apururu and all the ministers.
 8845: The Minister of the Optistery is the oldest and most stubborn of the lot. Make sure you get the $3 from that old crack-pot.
 8846: ...You've done well. But the fact that a ragtag adventurer such as you could bring together all five rings... Something about that just chills my bones and makes me cringe.
 8847: This undertaking will most likely leave a mark on Windurst's history.
 8848: And now that we have all of the ministers in on the act, Apururu won't have to shoulder all the blame, will she?
 8849: ...Right, then. Let's complete the final preparations.
 8850: Hocus-pocus circularum-focus!
 8851: Ohohoho! Behold, the forbidden $3! Now all that's left is for you to take this to Apururu.
 8852: Wearing all five ministry rings at once is something I wouldn't recommend. The combined power consumes your body and you go up in flames--meaning your end.
 8853: To prevent this, I have created the $3. I've always wanted to try out this power for myself, but Karaha-Baruha would never lend me his $3...
 8854: Ooh! Just thinking about that makes me want to lash out and curse someone! If only I'd had that $3 back then... Oh, what I would have done!
 8855: This mission will create quite a stir. We must involve Minister Apururu and all the ministers.
 8856: The Minister of the Optistery is the oldest and most stubborn of the lot. Make sure you get the $3 from that old crack-pot.
 8857: Ohohohoho! It looks like my $3 had the desired effect!
 8858: Ajido-Marujido's failure to regain consciousness is the only slight complication I was able to detect...
 8859: But you don't need to go and start worrying. Why, it would take more than that to finish off a mage that had survived my tutelage and training!
 8860: ...Now, about the $3.
 8861: Due to a slight miscalculation on my part, the rings have become fused to the glove, I see. But don't worry. With a few twists, I'll soon have them free.
 8862: I'll just hold on to the ministry rings for a little while longer. Ohohoho!
 8863: A blue energy wells up within you...!
 8864: ...The energy that pours down from on high, flowing over the victors of the challenge...
 8865: Have you not noticed, <Player>? The energy that filled you has been stolen.
 8866: <Player>, look within yourself. The energy that had been granted to you and your adventurer brethren has been stolen.
 8867: My gaze sweeps the world, and I have glimpsed the plunderer of that power.
 8868: A detestable puppet. Cursed prayer. Warped logic... The common people stand in the center of that maelstrom.
 8869: Yes... Now, in the western city of Bastok...
 8870: You remember the voice of Carbuncle.
 8871: ...What diddly-doodley can I do for you? You met a slam-dangly talented Tarutaru named Ildy-Goldy in Bastok, and he wants you to ask me about Uran-Mafran?
 8872: Not sure I can hip-helpily help you. I only remember the name-a-roonies of the cute girls who are connected with my research.
 8873: Uran-Mafran, Uran-Mafran... I'm sure I've heard that name around-a-doodily somewhere before.
 8874: Argh! I just can't remembereeno!
 8875: If you give me a little more time to think-dinkily-dink, you can have this. I get asked to do-a-diddy-do so many things, my brain is fit to bang-bustingly-burst!
 8876: ...Ergh! Just give me a little more time-a-rime. I get asked to do-a-diddy-do so many things at once, my brain is fit to bang-bustingly-burst!
 8877: ...Quickly... The stolen energy grows in strength...
 8878: If my humble power can be the key to open the rusted door of memories...
 8879: ...Diddly-darn it! I don't get it... How do I complete this...?
 8880: Hmm...? Can I help you...? Right now I'm riding the train-areeno of depression into the wall of frustration.
 8881: At this rate, Professor Shantotto will...
 8882: The $3 falls to the ground and sparkles brilliantly.
 8883: Ah, that light!
 8884: ...Ah! That's it!
 8885: Bring me four $2! That's the key! The solution to my problem is at hand-aroony.
 8886: Back already? You adventurer-types know your stuff.
 8887: Now it's diddly-down to business. With these, I should be able to...
 8888: <groan>...
 8889: This shouldn't have...
 8890: Wait! I just remembered something!
 8891: Yes, it was diddly-definitely... Uran-Mafran was a student in the advanced class-aroo when I was still actively working as the Principal of the School of Magic.
 8892: He was an exceptional student with impeccable test results and a bright-ariffic future. The other students called him the "Puppet Master."
 8893: At that time, the pre-prep-position of Manustery minister was viddily-vacant, with Minister Zonpa-Zippa having been abduc-tapily-ducted by the rogue Cardians...
 8894: Apururu, the current Minister of the Manustery, and her brother-eeno, Ajido-Marujido, were still just children.
 8895: And so I chose two stoop-stupily-students from the advanced-diddily-do class. Before they graduated, I had to doo-diddly-decide which would become the new Manustery minister.
 8896: One of those students was the person you mentioned, Uran-Mafran.
 8897: However... The reason I didn't rang-dangly-remember him was because he suddenly uppity-up and disappeared not long after becoming the Minister of the Manustery.
 8898: On top of that, Uran-Mafran used a mojo-mad-magic doll to erase all memories of himself from the people of Windurst before he left. That kind of enchantment-aroony is strictly forbidden-areeno...
 8899: Principal Koru-Moru!
 8900: Principal Koru-Moru!
 8901: Well, dang-diddly-doodily! Ildy-Goldy and Rukususu!?
 8902: Have you heard zee whole story from zis adventurer? Uran-Mafran has been seen lurking around near zee protocrystals zat are zee current study topic of zee Rhinosterie.
 8903: That svine is up to no good. He's using a magic doll to manipulate-vate a constant stream of adventurers into entering the crystals.
 8904: Hold on, hold on! I only just manly-managed to remem-demily-member who Uran-Mafran was.
 8905: What was that you were chat-tattily-talking about? Those protocrystals? What doodily-do they have inside them?
 8906: Avatars. Zey're similar to zee great beast zat used to roam Sarutabaruta on nights of zee full moon.
 8907: Avatars are generally in a deep-veep slumber, but if they are approached with the tuning forks created by the Rhinostery, they come raging forth, looking to do battle-vattle.
 8908: Oho, how very exciting-ariffic. And if you defeat them in battle-o-rama?
 8909: I don't really know. Something is supposed to happen, but I never felt anything...
 8910: Hmmm. Curious, very curious indeed-aroony. Ildy-Goldy, you mentioned how Uran-Mafran was manipulating adventurer-eenos with a magic doll...
 8911: Yes. But I have no idea vhy. I vould like to ask him about that, but he alvays runs from me.
 8912: Hmmm...
 8913: Right, then! I have a doot-doot-duty to look out for my students, no matter how old and crumbly-mumbly they get!
 8914: First off, we need to inform-aroo the graduates from Uran-Mafran's class of his reappearance. If they've forgotten about him, you must jiggly-jolt their memories!
 8915: Vhat a blast from the past. That nagging-vagging old Fuepepe continued on to the Aurastery, didn't she?
 8916: And let's see... Furakku-Norakku is probably half-asleep at his desk in the Optistery.
 8917: Right. And lastly, zere's the fiery Sunny-Pabonny who went on to zee Orastery just like he wanted.
 8918: Ah, he's Minister Shantotto's... Vait, it's Professor Shantotto now, isn't it? Anyvay, Sunny-Pabonny was a hugey-vuge fan of hers, as I recall.
 8919: ...Okey-doodily-day. We can leave that task to this adventurereeno.
 8920: Go and meet with those three people, and speak to them about Uran-Mafran. They should remember who he is.
 8921: I have a diddly-different job for Rukususu and Ildy-Goldy to do. Come this way.
 8922: Oui, Principal!
 8923: Coming, Principal!
 8924: Ildy-Goldy. Rukususu. Fuepepe. Furakku-Norakku. Sunny-Pabonny.
 8925: And lastly, Uran-Mafran.
 8926: These are the names of all the student-aroos who were in that advanced class. With all the terrible-ariffic goings-on in that generation of students, they became quite a tightly-knit bunch.
 8927: You must informly-form my formerly-former students of the reappearance of Uran-Mafran. Unlike me, they should remem-memberly-member who he is.
 8928: You want to know where to find Sunny-Pabonny? How am I supposed to know where he is at?
 8929: He went off last month... Or was it earlier than that?
 8930: Anyway, he went to San d'Oria to find some sort of armor, and I haven't heard from him since.
 8931: Ohohoho! He'll show up when you least expect it, I'm convinced.
 8932: Everyone is up to ding-dangly-date on the situation? I should think no one had forgotten about Uran-Mafran.
 8933: When Uran-Mafran left Windurst, he cast an enchantment that would cause everybod-boddily-body in town to forget about him. However, it had no effect-aroo on my students and me.
 8934: If zee principal hadn't shielded us, we too would have forgotten about Uran-Mafran.
 8935: Ve really appreciate that, Principal.
 8936: I'm terribly flang-diddly-forgetful to start with, so I would have forgotten about him anyway. Ahahaha!
 8937: So, Rukususu, Ildy-Goldy. What did you fine-doodily-find out?
 8938: Well... I talked to people who were working at zee Manustery at zee time of Uran-Mafran's disappearance, but not one of zem remembered him.
 8939: And of course, Apururu and zee other current Manustery staff were not aware of any of zis.
 8940: If you defeat the avatars that reside vithin the protocrystals, then you are granted a portion-vortion of that avatar's power.
 8941: It appears that Uran-Mafran offers a reward to adventurers who have besty-vested the avatars, and then steals the power that they have gained.
 8942: Hmmm. What is Uran-Mafran ping-doodily-planning to do with this power of the avatars...?
 8943: It has me worried. You don't think he's going to attempt a...summoning...like Karaha-Baruha did...?
 8944: No, Uran-Mafran's power is dang-diddly-delicate and subtle-ariffic. He wouldn't be capable of controlling the avatars...
 8945: I wonder if this has any connection-aroo with his sudden withdrawal-areeno from his position of minister?
 8946: ...Principal Koru-Moru, ve need to talk to Uran-Mafran directly. I vill see if I can track him down.
 8947: And I will search for clues in places other zan zee Manustery. I will see what I can find.
 8948: Hmmm. I didn't really want to say this, but Uran-Mafran always had the potential to become a destructariffic force.
 8949: My student-areenos may be threatened by more than just the loss of their memories. I have this for you, just in case.
 8950: The power googily-gained from dip-doodily-defeating an avatar... Why would Uran-Mafran be gathering that energy?
 8951: I wonder if this has any connection-aroo to his sudden withdrawal-areeno from the Manustery minister position!
 8952: ......
 8953: Help me...
 8954: Oh, it's you. Accordily-cording to the staff at the Rhinostery, there's been an incident with one of their researcher-areenos.
 8955: It might be Uran-Mafran's diddily-doing. Hurry on over and see what's hap-happily-happened.
 8956: What the ding-daddily-doodily did you say!? Ildy-Goldy's was ensorcelled by some magicified doll, and taken away by Uran-Mafran!?
 8957: That slime-slamming-scoundrel! His sense of diddly-decency has completely rot-totily-totted away!
 8958: Principal Koru-Moru!
 8959: I've discovered something very suspicious!
 8960: Rukususu!
 8961: What doodily-do you mean, suspicious? What did you find out?
 8962: Zee only time zee Manustery wasn't in zee red was when Uran-Mafran was minister! It appears zat a trader in Windurst Waters called Honoi-Gomoi was making donations to zee ministry...
 8963: Honoi-Gomoi...!? The dang-doodily-descendant of the famous Maelstrom Mage!
 8964: Ooooh, I've got a really bad-daddily-dad feeling about this!
 8965: The Manustery and the Maelstrom Mage! Uran-Mafran, you black-heart, what evil schemeroo are you half-bakingly hatching!?
 8966: Rukususu...adventurer...take this and go. Use it on Ildy-Goldy, and it should bash-bangingly-break whatever spell-aroo Uran-Mafran has over him.
 8967: Get out there and fine-diddly-find Uran-Mafran. We must prevent him from using the energy he's stored in that Mana Orb before it's too lateroo...!
 8968: The Manustery and the Maelstrom Mage! Uran-Mafran, you black-heart, what evil schemeroo are you half-bakingly hatching!?
 8969: Find Uran-Mafran! We must soop-stoopily-stop him from using the piddily-power he's accumulated...!
 8970: Did you did-diddily-discover anything?
 8971: Greatily-greatified Goddess! Ildy-Goldy! You're okay!
 8972: Oho...! You were able to swoopily-swipe the Mana Orb from Uran-Mafran? That takes care of one problem-areeno.
 8973: So this is the Mana Orb he was using. There is an awesome power sing-speedingly-seething within...
 8974: Yes, zee intensity is dreadful. I cannot even bear to hold zee orb itself.
 8975: Hmm. With this kind of power, you could bring a person back from doom-daddily-death's domain.
 8976: Bring somevone back to life!?
 8977: A spell of resurrection...!?
 8978: Indeedily-doo. In everyday circles, it's referred to as the "Legend of the Magic Doll."
 8979: If the creator of a magic doll diddily-dies, that magic doll will lose its magic and passingly perish. By the same logic-aroo, if you were to restore life to the doll, the creator would return from the jaundiced-jagged-jaws of doodily-death.
 8980: But this fordiddily-forbidden practice really does exist outside of legend. Only the Manustery minister knows the root-tootin-ritual, and the dark-doodily-details have been a closely-guarded secret for generations. Naturally, the use of this magic-aroo is prohibited, even to the minister.
 8981: I see...it makes sense now. Uran-Mafran became Minister of zee Manustery long enough to learn zee ritual, zen left once he had gleaned its secrets...
 8982: But if all that is true... Who on Vana'diel is Uran-Mafran trying to resurrect...?
 8983: Principal...
 8984: ...I know who it is. As soon as I heard about Rukususu's discoveroos, I immediately took action.
 8985: The dolls of history's great magereenos are stored under heavy-doot-doodily-duty guard in Heavens Tower. After these events, that security has been strengthened even furtheroo.
 8986: Great mages of the past... You mean...
 8987: Yes. For the moment-aroo, we've foiled Uran-Mafran's ambitions, but you can be sure he won't give up that easily.
 8988: Ildy-Goldy, you are the only one who can stand against Uran-Mafran's sorcerer-iffic power. Can I count on you to doodily-do your part?
 8989: Of course, Principal.
 8990: The Rhinostery researcher-areenos who are under the control of Uran-Mafran pose another problem. I am looking into a solution with the help of Professor Yoran-Oran, but this may take some time...
 8991: You have our support, Principal.
 8992: And lastly, there is you, adventurer-eeno. By helping us in this matter, you will be poopity-putting yourself in dang-diddly-danger.
 8993: Take this. At long last I've com-doodily-completed it... Karaha-Baruha's experimental armor.
 8994: You noodily-need this more than Professor Shantotto does. Make shoobidy-sure you look after it.
 8995: Few mages have fallen as far into black-broodily-darkness as Uran-Mafran.
 8996: He reminds me of that villain-areeno of the past, the Maelstrom Mage. Sends tingly-shivers down my spine-diddliy-hind.
 8997: I can't stand waiting here, sitting on our hands. It's taken months to reconstruct those plans. Months to decipher the code. Months to journy this far down the road...
 8998: How long is it going to take until the brilliant armor designed by Karaha-Baruha is done!?
 8999: I'll never forgive Professor Koru-Moru if I'm not the first to try it on!
 9000: ...... I can't really go into too much detail about this mission right in frontaru of Heavens Tower...
 9001: Minister Apururu wants you to hurry over to the Manustery.
 9002: It seems that Minister Ajido-Marujido may be on the verge of waking up from his coma...
 9003: That mightaru just be hopeful speculation on my part, but Miss Apururu has been seen hurry-scurrying back and forth between Windurst Woods and Windurst Walls.
 9004: This is a mission from Minister Apururu of the Manustery. Please keep the details tip-top secret.
 9005: Sibyl Guard Semih Lafihna has returned to Heavens Tower, but hopefully she won'taru be visiting the Dark Dungeon any time soon.
 9006: According to the gossip-dossip of the ladies-in-waiting, Semih Lafihna has been to-ing and fro-ing all over the place trying to find information on the bearer of darkness that appeared in Heavens Tower.
 9007: I was standing rightaru here when all the fuss erupted, and I have no memory-zemory of letting such a creature pass into the tower. It must be some sort of ghosty-toasty...
 9008: You gotta hand it to those Mithra. She goes off in search of the thing when most normal people would be running in the other direction. Ghosties give me the shivers...
 9009: I've heardy some disturbing rumors. Apparently Doctor Shantotto has been trying all sorts of things to rousey Ajido-Marujido from his slumbery...
 9010: The poor minister is probably in much more danger now than when he was languishingy in the Dark Dungeon... I'm terribly-werribly worried for him, but I'm petrifiedy of what I might see if I go to check!
 9011: You know, I've been thinking. If the Sibyl Guards are orrrphans of the Great War, then wouldn't they hate the Yagudo even more than us other Mithra?
 9012: I suppose that as a race, the Mithra don't hold much with grrrudges. Maybe their anger has cooled off over the years?
 9013: Hooray! I never thought that Minister Ajido-Marujido would be forgiven so quickly-trickly for his transgressions!
 9014: Were you there when he talked with the Star Sibyl? I heard that Minister Apururu said she has a lot to thank you for!
 9015: The Orastery mages are relievedy that Minister Ajido-Marujido will be back to run the ministry just as he always has.
 9016: The boys in Operations were so afraidy that Doctor Shantotto would returny as minister, they started planning out Code E emergency procedures. ..Ahahaha... ...What? You think they were serious?
 9017: Chieftainness Perih Vashai is to seek an audience with the Star Sibyl concerning the events surrounding Orastery minister Ajido-Marujido.
 9018: Don't get me wrong--it's not like the chieftainness is a close friend of the minister or anything. These events have set something in motion. And I think we're about to find out what that something is...
 9019: I'm worried-ethy about Miss Apururu. I wish I had time to listen-ethy to her woes, but this thesis I'm writing takes up all my waking hours...
 9020: It concerns the research-ethy I'm doing on the mandragora that you adventurers have been helping-ethy me with. I've reached the point-ethy where I'm almost ready to publish-ethy my findings.
 9021: Let me tell you something I've discovered in my research. It appears that the Mandragora derive nourishment-ethy from $1.
 9022: They also have a great-ethy love for $2, but I have no idea where you might find one.
 9023: How disappointing. Ajido-Marujido woke up on his own before I could think of some new spells to fling.
 9024: I'm achy-waking to grill him on what he saw in the Book of the Gods, but I supppose I'll give him some time to recover.
 9025: The word "restraint" doesn'taru exist in my dictionary, you'll discover. Ohohoho!
 9026: <Player>, you have orders to reportaru to Heavens Tower. Those pesky Yagudo are causing trouble again.
 9027: There has been a proposal addressed to the Star Sibyl for a revision-wision of the peace treaty between the Yagudo and Windurst.
 9028: Each proposal the Yagudo send is more demanding than the lastaru. It's like they're deliberataruly picking a fight with us.
 9029: ...With all this going on, how can we say that Windurst is really in a state of peace...? Um, please forget I said that. I was justaru thinking out loud...
 9030: A proposal has been sentaru to Heavens Tower for a revision of the peace treaty between the Yagudo and Windurst.
 9031: I justaru can't understand why the Yagudo are being so agressive-wessive. Is this their way of pulling a fastaru one on us?
 9032: I heard from the ladies-in-waiting that they haven't seen the Star Sibyl around lately-dately.
 9033: You know, with Ajido-Marujido forgiven for his crimes and we guards going unpunished-bunished, I get the feeling that something more importantaru must be going on...
 9034: Maybe, just maybe... She's taking a secretaru vacation!? Hmm, not likely, huh...?
 9035: Oh, good griefy, the Mithra are getting all firedy up again. You can'taru mentiony the word "Yagudo" around them without sparks flying out of their ears!
 9036: Those black-blooded, back-stabbing Yagudo scum! We Mithra should wipe out the entire rrrace!
 9037: What is the Star Sibyl afrrraid of? Taking rrresponsiblity for a war? That Windurst would lose?
 9038: If fighting brrreaks out on the streets like it did twenty years ago, we should just blast the hell out of 'em with that summoning magic stuff.
 9039: I mightaru be a guard for Windurst Walls, but no one loves the entire city of Windurst more than me.
 9040: And that is why you have my most sincerest-werest gratitude. I can barely put into words how much I appreciataru what you have done.
 9041: I still remember hiding with my mother in Heavens Tower when the war was raging all aboutaru Windurst. I will never forgetaru the scene that met my eyes when I looked back from this spot.
 9042: Your adventures may take you to distantaru lands, but please don't forget the gentle breeze, clear blue skies, and beautiful vistas of Windurst.
 9043: Lady Zubaba is being all naggy-haggy about the guards helping out with the Dark Dungeon jailbreak.
 9044: As soon as she has any free time on her hands, she uses it to picky-stick on other people's faults. I knew it was too good to lastaru...
 9045: Oh, <Player>! I heardy you were the one who saved the Star Sibyl!
 9046: Can I have your autography? It'll become a family heirloom! I'll keepy it locked in a treasure chest!
 9047: We Mithra are going to be rrrunning wild in Windurst Woods again, so don't forget to stop by. Oh, and before you go...
 9048: ...can I have your autograph?
 9049: Ah, it's such a waste. Such a wonderful glove that can never be replaced.
 9050: I would have gladly blasty-wasted a hundred people to keep it mine to use... But since Apururu offered me three years' worth of the Manustery's budgetaru, how could I refuse?
 9051: Things have worked out for the bestaru. I'm not even upset that I wasn't called to join the Full Moon Fountain battle.
 9052: I'll just weave some curses to give their nerves a little rattle. Ohohohoho!
 9053: I heard-ethy from Apururu that Karaha-Baruha was brought-ethy back to life by the forbidden ritual of the Manustery.
 9054: Zonpa-Zippa had-ethy been in Karaha-Baruha's shadow ever since he was a studentaru. I wonder if he was the one who leaked-ethy the ritual?
 9055: If that's the case, Zonpa-Zippa is guilty of violating-ethy a law. It mightaru be best for him to stay where he is--locked-ethy up in the Boyahda Tree.
 9056: Ergh... Why, diddly-doodley, do you bother me? I was just with a diddly-dear old buddily-buddy under a fling-dangly-full moon...
 9057: Oh, it's you, adventureeno. I heard from Karaha-Baruha how you play-doodily-played a major-mojo part in resurrecting the Great Beast-aroo.
 9058: Hrm? That's wang-diddly-weird. Karaha-Baruha's doot-doodily-deceased, isn't he? Did I dream-ify all that?
 9059: Well, even if it was a dazy-diddly-daydream, Karaha-Baruha wanted to thank you.
 9060: And he told me to goopily-give back the magicified doll I borrowed. Ahahaha!
 9061: V $3P An age passed, and a time of destruction drew near. The moon fell into shadow, the stars grew silent, and the people lost their way.
 9062: d $3TThose who found the light again were those who knew themselves. Those who knew courage. Those who knew justice. Those who knew truth.
 9063: R $3TAnd then there came one whose determination would create a new future. That radiance would be as a beacon for all that lay ahead.
 9064: V $3P Once again, a star of hope has been born to this earth...
 9065: R $3TA new tale will begin here, woven by the myriad stars of this universe...
 9066: You there. You appear to carry yourself with a certain flair.
 9067: The snap in the wrist, a sturdy arm. Your breathing, controlled and calm...
 9068: Justaru the type for wielding heavy, blunt, pain-inflictaruing objects... I would even go so far as to say you were born to swing the staff. You'll be the perfect addition to my team of test subjects!
 9069: For someone like you, I have just the thing. Here's a new toy. Go on, give it a swing!
 9070: Beyond what you'd expect? The rightaru length, the rightaru weight, and the balance is perfect... What you now hold is my made-to-order, specialized training staff!
 9071: Don'taru just stand there like a doe-eyed calf! Go out and pound with that pole until you can pound no more! Go on! Shoo! What are you waiting for? Ohohohohohohoho!
 9072: What's this? There's no chat-watting during training. Is something amiss?
 9073: Is something amiss? [No, everything's justaru fine./I lostaru the $1.../I can'taru go on.]
 9074: You lostaru it!?
 9075: Let me think for a bit. Could you perhaps have been swing-winging too hard? I myself have been known to send a staff flying into someone's backyard.
 9076: Well, it's good to see that you have fight-smiting spirit. Even if you are somewhat lacking in wit. Ohohoho!
 9077: You're giving up!?
 9078: Give up on the quest? [I've had enough./Not just yet.]
 9079: This kind of specialized training is not for everyone. Only the very bestaru staff-wielders are left standing when the day is done.
 9080: I understand your position. Allow me to leave you with these words of wisdom:
 9081: Give up, you loser! Throw that staff away! That poor length of wood mustaru be ashamed to be swung by such a wimp, anyway!
 9082: Ohohoho! I'm really getting the hang of this evil coach deal! You get rid of that staff, and this time it's over for real.
 9083: When that staff can be swung no more, bring it here to me. Now get back out there and train harder, my little prodigy! Ohohoho!
 9084: What's this I see? Justaru glancing at that staff tells me your training lacks intensity!
 9085: Oho! You've done a masterful job of demolishing that staff! After watching your maniacal training, I hope your friends were still able to laugh...
 9086: Well, your friends are not importantaru now. Let's see what you've learned. Show me some ka-pow!
 9087: The test of your newfound proficiency will take place at the Cauldron of Ifrit. Make sure to bring back $6, and try not to get turned into mincemeat.
 9088: Train hard, and ka-blam, you've suddenly learned a new technique. That's what tests are greataru for--along with my detailed critique. Ohohohoho!
 9089: The time for the test is upon you. Journey to Ifrit's Cauldron and discover that new skill. Ta-taru!
 9090: Oh, my poor little adventurer... Startaru your training again from the beginning, you total loser!
 9091: Oho! The triumphantaru hero has returned! Let's see what amazing-wazing new tricks you've learned!
 9092: Were you hit by a bolt of inspiration-wation? Absolutaruly nothing? Did the battle lack the required level of desperation?
 9093: You really are a sorry case. Well, let me teach you a technique I discovered, a fight-wighting move with both power and grace.
 9094: When your back's against the wall and there's no escape from the dragon's lair, justaru pretend this skill was taught to you by a beautiful goddess that appeared out of thin air.
 9095: Ohohohoho! Another member for my team with a wondrous tale to tell! We're really gonna give those Orastery mages hell!
 9096: The Martial Mages Mortal Mashfest will be a grand affair! Those weakling wizards need a good blood-soaked battle to toughen them up, a little scare!
 9097: You have too many items. You cannot carry the $0. Sort your items, change areas, and try again.
 9098: You have learned the weapon skill "Retribution"!
 9099: The minstrel of melodies is my name, For a mere $6 gil I'll recall your past. Your stories of love, anger, triumph, and shame, The river of memories runs deep and vast.

 9121: You cannot enter Dynamis - [Dummy/San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Beaucedine/Xarcabard/Valkurm/Buburimu/Qufim/Tavnazia] for $0 [day/days] (Vana'diel time).
 9122: You hear a mysterious, floating voice: The guiding aura has not yet faded... Bring forth the $0.
 9123: Players who have not reached level $0 are prohibited from entering Dynamis.
 9124: Players who do not possess $6 are prohibited from entering Dynamis - [Dummy/San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Beaucedine/Xarcabard/Valkurm/Buburimu/Qufim/Tavnazia].
 9125: % and $1 cannot be used here.
 9126: <Player>... Now that I have passed from the mortal realm, I have only you to turn to. The time left to me is short.
 9127: Thirty years ago, I came into contact with the insidious power of this land, and rose from the grave. However, at the same time, this world laid claim to a part of my soul...
 9128: I have been released from the hate that consumed me, but the half of my soul that was taken captive all those years ago is calling to me... It has become a towering darkness. A raging hatred, spawned from the depths of my being...
 9129: Very soon I will be drawn into that soul. I no longer have the strength to resist. The soul that was divided will become whole once more, and that rage will take on physical form.
 9130: A new Shadow Lord will be born. Surely you have sensed the growing evil? The beastman armies that are imprisoned here are massing for battle. They plan a return to the world of their origin, the realm that exists beneath the light of hope.
 9131: My link to you will soon be severed, so listen carefully. Thirty years ago, an expeditionary squad formed from the elite soldiers of each nation was sent to investigate the Northlands. You must have seen their memories when you first laid your hand upon the chunks of magicite.
 9132: Seek out the markings that the expedition members left behind. They will aid you in gaining entrance to this world. You must defeat the Shadow Lord before our unification is complete. My hopes go with you, <Player>.
 9133: There is an unusual arrangement of branches here.
 9134: There is an unusual arrangement of pebbles here.
 9135: The strands of grass here have been tied together.
 9136: There is an unusual arrangement of leaves on the ground.
 9137: I see you have met with Raogrimm. His soul is no longer confined to that incarnation of rage, the Shadow Lord, yet the fact remains that he has committed sins beyond redemption.
 9138: In spite of those sins, I still wish to rescue him from the darkness. I no longer have a mortal body with which to act, and so the most I can do is guide you in my stead.
 9139: You will need the $3, a key that bridges the void between Vana'diel and that other world.
 9140: It is said that there are items in this world that gain a soul of their own through contact with the thoughts and dreams of other living creatures. The $3 is one of those items.
 9141: You must look for the Goblin peddlers. They are certain to have knowledge of the $3. When you have it safely within your grasp, seek out the markings that we left behind...
 9142: That world is a land now draped in the blackest night. We can pass from one world to the other, but without the physical forms lost to us thirty years ago, there is little we can do to intervene.
 9143: Raogrimm is the one who... No, the world has been divided into separate realms through the machinations of the new Shadow Lord.
 9144: The Shadow Lord resides in the Xarcabard of the other reality. However, I fear you would be marching to your death should you go to confront him... I ask you to first obtain trophies from four of the alternate realms.
 9145: We understand that there is little time to spare. But without a certain degree of power, it will be impossible to traverse the land the Shadow Lord holds in thrall. Show me your strength with the four trophies you bring back.
 9146: Those whose fate is linked to his world will empower the $3 to guide you...
 9147: I never believed that my indifference to the state of other nations would cause harm to my beloved San d'Oria...
 9148: As part of my penance, I will infuse the $3 with what guidance I can.
 9149: I betrayed him... And now I am needed, the one who cut down poor Cornelia. The man cursed with the brand of traitor...
 9150: Sure, I got everything I wanted, but what was left to me in the end? For one rash action, all I gained was an empty title and irreconcilable guilt...
 9151: I doubt you'll listen to the words of a traitor, but please, help free him from the bonds of his eternal night...
 9152: Our expedition was supposed to have been an allied effortaru, but not one of us was interested in the fate of the other nations. In our hasty-waste to outdo each other, we failed to see to the heart of the mattaru.
 9153: Our attitudes led to the death of two of our members, and precipitated the birth of the Shadow Lord... This sin does not belong on Raogrimm's shoulders alone. We all mustaru atone for our actions.
 9154: Please help him. Help Raogrimm escape from his horrid-worrid darkness, forever this time.
 9155: Humes and Galka have never been the best of friends. I used to think that was just the way it was, and always would be.
 9156: I figured I'd be causing myself grrrief if I stuck my whiskers into other nations' problems. My next catnap was all that mattered to me in those days. Ignorrrance is bliss, as they say.
 9157: Responsibility for Raogrimm's trrransformation lies with all of us who traveled with him on that expedition. By sharing the blame for the crimes he committed as the Shadow Lord, we can finally call ourselves his trrrue companions.
 9158: Let me help you on your path. May guiding light fill this $3! Raogrimm's fate is in your hands.
 9159: There is a broken branch thrust into the ground here.
 9160: There is a symbol carved into the rock here.
 9161: I have been waiting for you.
 9162: Do you remember the last words Raogrimm spoke to you? "The link will soon be severed"... Do you understand the significance of these words?
 9163: When the soul that was divided is whole once again, towering rage will take on physical form... Yes, a new Shadow Lord will be born. Even I will no longer hear his voice.
 9164: Even now, I can barely feel the emanations of Raogrimm's faltering spirit. When those emanations fade completely, he will be...
 9165: The Xarcabard of that other realm is shrouded in a vast darkness, preventing contact from the outside. Even those of us without material bodies are unable to penetrate that mist of eternal night.
 9166: Until that mist clears, I cannot guide you to Xarcabard. The next place you must venture is the twin of Vana'diel's Beaucedine. There you will find the last trophy to complete the set of keys we need.
 9167: You must obtain the last trophy. All five trophies combined with our power will create a synergistic force, allowing us to part the shroud for a few precious moments. It will open a path between worlds.
 9168: Take care, my brave adventurer. May the blessings of Altana guide and protect you...
 9169: Even after the blackest night, the golden sun always rises to begin a new morning. This troubled land will soon have its dawn...of that I am certain.
 9170: I never thought to walk this land again, not even in death. Is this what they call karma...?
 9171: This land has borne the weight of my sins. I will not beg for forgiveness, but accept my responsibility...
 9172: So this is the reason for that unspeakable terror I feltaru here when I was still alive. It's possible that the other realm has existed for much longer than anyone ever dreamed... Keep your wits aboutaru you, <Player>.
 9173: I'm not rrreally fond of touching platitudes. Snap Raogrimm to his senses with a big ol' smack to the head for me.
 9174: It is time! Put an end to this thirty-year nightmare, <Player>. 3! Show us the path to Xarcabard!
 9175: Death does not exist in that realm. You might call it a "prison of souls."
 9176: Even those who fall in battle will rise again after a time as if nothing had happened. Like a flame returning to a candle whose light has been extinguished...
 9177: It is an endless succession of life and death. How many times has that cycle repeated itself in that damned abode?
 9178: There is one thing that bothers me. Whatever happened to the original wielders of the weapons and armor that the beastmen there now possess? If the statues in the shape of Orcs and such were once actual beastmen, then...? But I get carried away with my musings.
 9179: Please pay no mind to my ramblings. You have secured the $3. An incredible feat. It proves the strength of your conviction, and is one of the keys you will need to enter Xarcabard.
 9180: You will need four such trophies. Once you have them within your grasp, make your way to Beaucedine Glacier in the Northlands. Cornelia awaits you there.
 9181: I don't know about the other four, but I can't hear his voice anymore...
 9182: Is this another brand I must bear for my treachery? I must truly be hated if that's the case.
 9183: It is something I would wish for at the moment, however. I pray this silence is just a continuation of our incompatible personalities. If not, then it means his pronouncement has become reality...
 9184: 3. This is more than just a testament to your strength. It is one of the keys that will lead you to Xarcabard, along with the trophies of the other realms.
 9185: When you have all four trophies, travel to Beaucedine Glacier in the Northlands. You will find Cornelia waiting for you there. That is all the wisdom I have left to give you.
 9186: What is the true nature of that other world? I can only explain it as a place that lies beyond the limitarus of our knowledge. But I'm sure I've feltaru that aura somewhere before...
 9187: That's it. That protocrystal I came across when I was doing research in Elshimo. The magical emanations coming from the crystal gave me a similar impression. An avatar? No, that can'taru be...
 9188: Oh! Oh, I'm terribly-werribly sorry! I appear to have driftarued into my old habits.
 9189: Now, <Player>. This $3 is both a symbol of your fortitude, and one of the keys that will help you gain access to Xarcabard. The trophies from the other three realms carry the same importance.
 9190: Gather all four trophies and hurry yourself on to Beaucedine Glacier. Cornelia will be waiting for you when you get there. But be wary, <Player>. The blackness enveloping that world grows ever deeper, ever darker...
 9191: The beastmen of that world carry the spoils of prrrevious battles. Equipment that you or I would use.
 9192: I'm not able to touch them in my prrresent form, but I feel something about those weapons and armor...something extrrraordinary.
 9193: Wait, wait, wait! I don't mean that they're currrsed or anything like that! It's something more like, um, not ominous, but... How can I explain it?
 9194: Anyway! They're not evil, just...you know? Different from other normal swords and things. Being all ghostlike and stuff, you can feel things like that.
 9195: But enough of that kinda talk--congrrratulations are in order! You've got your paws on the $3! It shows you've got the goods in the hero department, and it will also help you get into Xarcabard.
 9196: But first you've got to collect the other three trophies and then hightail it to snowy Beaucedine Glacier. Cornelia should be up there waiting for you.
 9197: 3 and the four trophies. These artifacts have long been lost to that other world. The Hydra Corps was a unit formed after our expedition to the Northlands.
 9198: It must have been in the time of the Great War... Nobody knows how the Hydra artifacts came to be there, but those five trophies will open the path for you.
 9199: Each of these items holds a measure of power. However, the strength of a single artifact is limited.
 9200: The $3 and the $3. Combining these separate entities created a bridge from Vana'diel to the other realms. Xarcabard, I'm afraid, is another matter entirely...
 9201: Unless the shroud of darkness is lifted, that power alone will not be enough to open the way. However, the five trophies resonate with another artifact that lies within his land. If we can join our strength to theirs...
 9202: Let us make haste to the land where this all began. To Xarcabard...
 9203: Is it over...?
 9204: No, the rage has merely been dispersed.
 9205: As long as I exist, he will never truly die...
 9206: Or perhaps an eternal soul is something beyond the concept of death?
 9207: <Player>... You have achieved an incredible feat--the unification of the Shadow Lord has been prevented. I have not the words to express my gratitude.
 9208: The power of the crystal has faded, but I will be drawn into that towering rage no more. I have heard the voice of the one who holds sway over this realm...
 9209: The one who holds sway...?
 9210: Yes. From the center of infinite darkness. I was in a place beyond comprehension when those words reached into my mind...
 9211: You who have touched the crystal, the one who holds immortal power within a mortal shell. The rage that has arisen from your twisted core will devour my world.
 9212: It was an error in judgment to shelter you... The order of my realm has been disrupted.
 9213: I give to you a duty... You will stand vigil until an age without hatred has dawned.
 9214: No matter what terrible power you might wield, there is no escape from Dynamis for an incomplete soul. No return to the land of blessed light...
 9215: What manner of being was this who spoke from a pit of blackness? As this question gnawed at my mind, the voice grew quiet, leaving me in unanswered silence.
 9216: Of one thing I was certain. This voice belonged to the ruler of Dynamis.
 9217: A flow of energy exists in Vana'diel that has escaped the notice of those who dwell there.
 9218: Thirty years past, my contact with the crystal caused an accelerated change in this flow. It was as if it had leapt forward, rushing along a deliberate course.
 9219: Nobody knows what lies at the end of this journey. Perhaps it will reveal the true nature of Vana'diel.
 9220: <Player>, you may be the one to witness this truth.
 9221: The power stored in the $3 will soon be drained. And I must remain in this world in my role of observer.
 9222: Do not forget who you are, <Player>. I bid farewell to a most heroic adventurer.
 9223: My old companions...?
 9224: This duty is too much for just one to bear. If you will have me, I will stand at your side until an age without hatred has arrived. It pains me to see the depths to which my country has fallen.
 9225: That is my only reason for staying. Do not misunderstand my motivations.
 9226: Blessed light and the ruler of Dynamis? I do believe you've rekindled my long-forgotten sense of adventure.
 9227: Once I've gotten all firedy-up, even you can'taru keep me back, Raogrimm. I'm sure my incomparable research skills will be of use in your task.
 9228: C'mon, let's see a little excitement! This is our expedition's thirty-year rrreunion.
 9229: It's not the Northlands this time. None of us are going to grow old and die, so who else would you want with you on a task as long as this one?
 9230: I'm not gonna back down, no matterrr how much you complain. Better just give in and accept the fact that you're stuck with me.
 9231: I thought this would be the end of you for sure... Hmph. You're just as thick-skinned as you used to be.
 9232: What, no words for an old friend? Thinking about testing your theory on whether or not a soul can be killed?
 9233: I betrayed you! I extinguished the light of your precious Cornelia! The man responsible for this entire nightmare stands right before you!
 9234: Everything began thirty years ago. And there were things that came to an end... Even though I was a prisoner of uncontrollable rage, the fact remains that I took the lives of my companions with my own hands.
 9235: And yet, my old companions, you are the ones who have saved me from falling into that pit of hatred a second time.
 9236: I have words of gratitude, but do not stand in a position to blame anyone for their actions. No matter who that person may be.
 9237: Raogrimm...
 9238: Are you sure you want to do this? This duty will continue until hatred has faded from the land. As long as my divided soul remains, there may never be an end to that rage...
 9239: Raogrimm. There is no need to suffer alone anymore. Our presence here should answer your question.
 9240: There are crimes that must be atoned for. And if that means staying on after death and watching over this world, then we who were your companions will share the burden along with you.
 9241: Until the dawn of an age without hatred... No, as long as this world continues to be, I will remain by your side.
 9242: Cornelia...

 9244: $3U$3 [$3J$3o[$3h$3N$3$3A$3C$3x$3$3g]
 9245: There is a strange symbol drawn here. A haunting chill sweeps through you as you gaze upon it...
 9246: You hear a mysterious, floating voice: Present the $0...if you wish to pass into...my dream.
 9247: You hear a mysterious, floating voice: The sands of time yet fall... Present the...$0.
 9248: I am the ruler of Dynamis.
 9249: Are you lost? Or are you here by your own reckless designs? Either way, this is not your dream.
 9250: The dreamer of this realm is a separate entity than he who dreamt of that wasteland of malice, Xarcabard.
 9251: Who would dare bring a new dream into my world of Dynamis?
 9252: I divided my form in order to find the answer, but my counterpart has yet to return to me.
 9253: While wandering through this realm, you may come across another semblance of myself.
 9254: The memory of our encounter will become a guide to my shadow as it wanders this dream.
 9255: Search for my counterpart, and unite this realm with your own dream.
 9256: A nightmare curses this land yet again.
 9257: Take heed, dream traveler.
 9258: I have been watching your dream.
 9259: But you cannot grasp the identity of this realm's dreamer from there. This land will continue to devour its way into Dynamis.
 9260: You must find my counterpart and crush the dreamer of this realm.
 9261: I see that you have gathered three slivers of black crystal...
 9262: The Emptiness is sealed inside of them. Those are no mere fragments.
 9263: Those pieces of crystal have led you to this place... The source of this nightmare is near. I can feel the dreamer's presence.
 9264: The entrance to the dream has already been opened. Find and destroy the source if you wish to protect my realm.
 9265: I am...a unique entity...
 9266: We are...comprised of all entities...
 9267: Intermingling with one another...dividing among each other...
 9268: And devouring one another...
 9269: The shadow that you defeated had been consumed by the dreamer of this realm.
 9270: It seems that this nightmare was dreamt into existence by beings who have come into contact with the Emptiness.
 9271: It seems that this nightmare was dreamt into existence by beings who came into contact with the Emptiness.
 9272: Could it have been that girl...? When I next see her, she will pay dearly.
 9273: Could it have been that girl...? No, there was one more, transformed after death...
 9274: Her malice will not perish as long as this dream continues, using my shadows to revive countless times.
 9275: You must confront the nightmare and continue to fight them to keep this realm from spreading.
 9276: The dreamer is not the girl who once harbored the Emptiness... Could it have been transferred to another girl...?
 9277: You know this girl well. I could take care of her easily, but if you wish me to spare her, then you will lend me your power.
 9278: "Trade" the $6 to the "Hieroglyphics" found in each area. The $6 will be transformed into $7.
 9279: From that point on, one of the areas of Dynamis will be reserved by the bearer of the $7. The destination and time to be spent in Dynamis will be recorded in the help text of the $7.

However, the moment the maximum allowable number of players have entered Dynamis, all extra hourglasses will become void. Please take this into consideration when deciding to whom, and how many, copies are to be handed out.
 9284: To warp to Dynamis - [Dummy/San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Beaucedine/Xarcabard/Valkurm/Buburimu/Qufim/Tavnazia], "Trade" the $7 to the "Hieroglyphics" where you originally received it.

 9357: <Match $0> Entry period begins: Briefing begins:
 9358: I apologize, but your level is too low to participate in an official Brenner match.
 9359: Official matches are scheduled to begin at the following times: Match 1: Match 2: Match 3:
 9360: Teleportation to the Isle is free of charge, but a participation fee of $0 gil is required before each match.
 9361: Travel to the Isle? [Yes./Not yet.]
 9362: What would you like to know about? [Basic rules./Official/private matches./Flammen-Brenner./Flamme./Match score./Petras and quarrying./Sprint./KO./Return.]
 9363: The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:
 9364: First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of "Flammen-Brenner."
 9365: At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with "Flamme," or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.
 9366: Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.
 9367: The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.
 9368: The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.
 9369: If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The "match score" section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.
 9370: Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.
 9371: You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.
 9372: No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.
 9373: The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed $0 members, or if there are fewer than $1 members in a match where the two sides' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.
 9374: Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The Master of Ceremonies (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.
 9375: "LS Liga" is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.
 9376: A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.
 9377: The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.
 9378: If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.
 9379: After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.
 9380: Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.
 9381: In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.
 9382: Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.
 9383: Like Ballista, quarry (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up Petras and temporary items.
 9384: However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can trade a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.
 9385: Sprint cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the scout ability cannot be used in Brenner.
 9386: Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.
 9387: The sprint (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player's speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.
 9388: In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.
 9389: In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.
 9390: I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?
 9391: Can I help-ethy you? I am Yoran-Oran, former Minister of the Rhinostery...
 9392: Father!
 9393: Dad, we missed you!
 9394: Daddy, your beautiful children are here!
 9395: Wh-wh-what...what-ethy?
 9396: What is the meaning of this barging-ethy into people's homes? And why are you calling-ethy me "Daddy"?
 9397: You probably didn't know it, Father, but we were in Mother's tummy when you were separated.
 9398: In Mommy's tummy!
 9399: And that's why we've been looking for you all this time!
 9400: Looking for you, Daddy!
 9401: Why, Doctor-doodly Yoran-Oran! Who would've thought you'd have such cute-tootlin' kiddly-winks!?
 9402: So many children, you devious creature! We must have the Tarutaru Times write up a feature!
 9403: I have-ethy no idea what's going on here! There must-ethy be some sort of mistake!
 9404: Ohoho! You men are all the same. Not one of you ever wants to take the blame!
 9405: I understand-ethy now. Yes, I did travel to Tavnazia once, many years ago.
 9406: But that was only for the purpose-ethy of appraising a rare discovery.
 9407: Pirates, thieves, and all kinds of treasure hunters had brought-ethy unusual items from all over the world to the Marquisate...
 9408: These items had been hidden-ethy in a chamber beneath the Tavnazian Sacrarium.
 9409: I was led-ethy to that reliquiarium only after agreeing-ethy to never speak of the objects I would see.
 9410: When we entered the chamber, I was asked to look at a frightening-ethy statue that had been dug up from some goddess-forsaken labyrinth...
 9411: Frightening statue? Well, spring-spillingly-spill it, man! What kind of slap-daddily statue was it?
 9412: I...I'm not sure.
 9413: You were invited to the faraway land of Tavnazia and you gave them a "not sure"? All I have to say is, "What an amateur!"
 9414: An embarrassment to the ministers of Windurst, an absolutaru disgrace. You've gone and smeared mud on our collective face.
 9415: And now hear these poor fatherless children's wailings. Is there no end to your dismal failings?
 9416: I'm telling-ethy you, I am not their father!
 9417: And I was not called-ethy to Tavnazia to appraise the nature of that statue.
 9418: My task was to discern-ethy where it had been excavated from by analyzing the traces of soil that still clung-ethy to its surface.
 9419: And did you flang-fig-figurey out where the soil was from?
 9420: Of course I did. It was silt from the bottom-ethy of the sea. From the Sea of Shu'Meyo, I believe.
 9421: The Sea of Shu'Meyo... The inland-ified sea north of Jeuno.
 9422: Isn't that body of water non-stoppingly-notorious for ships sinking on even the calm-balmiest of days?
 9423: It is indeed-ethy. What's more, the statue was said to be found-ethy not in the sea, but deep-ethy within the earth.
 9424: What a fascinating tale, I must conclude. And after unfurling this mystery, you were elated enough to start your own brood?
 9425: Would you give it a rest-ethy!
 9426: Do you see-ethy what you've done! My reputation is in ruins!
 9427: Now explain-ethy yourselves!
 9428: We're sta`rving.
 9429: I feel...faint. No energy...to talk.
 9430: I feel dizzy...
 9431: Fine! There's a restaurant in Windurst Waters. Come back-ethy after you've had something to eat!
 9432: Yay!
 9433: All right!
 9434: Food!
 9435: Why me...?
 9436: What-ethy a calamity! My pristine-ethy image has been sullied!
 9437: No good-ethy! No good-ethy! I must restore-ethy my high standing in the community!
 9438: That's it! The Mimeo Mirror! Its memory-viewing powers are perfect-ethy for this situation!
 9439: I'll use the mirror to show-ethy all my memories of Tavnazia! I'll prove-ethy my innocence to the world!
 9440: Now if I can just remember-ethy the person who owned a Mimeo Mirror. I seem to recall-ethy a rather unpleasant personage boasting about his possessions a while back...
 9441: Calm-ethy yourself, Yoran-Oran. You're too worked up-ethy to think straight...
 9442: This story would surely be a scoop for the press. How will he get himself out of this mess?
 9443: A doctor is expected to show a good example to the up and coming mages. I'm sure he doesn't wantaru this recorded in Windurst's history pages.
 9444: Of course, I asked his children what kind of curse I should cast on their dad. But they don't seem to want to cause harm to the cad.
 9445: That's what you call familial piety. Another chance lost to increase my notoriety! Ohohohohoho!
 9446: I must-ethy remember before those children return-ethy from the Windurst Waters restaurant...
 9447: What-ethy a calamity! My pristine-ethy image has been sullied!
 9448: Hm!? Honoi-Gomoi entrusted-ethy you with $6? But this is no good-ethy if it's broken!
 9449: No good-ethy! No good-ethy! Think-ethy, Yoran-Oran! Think-ethy!
 9450: I have it! To fix the Mimeo Mirror, we will need-ethy $6 formed from $6. Better make that three of them!
 9451: Adventurer! You must-ethy go to the Attohwa Chasm and obtain-ethy yourself some Mimeo Jewels!
 9452: Then take-ethy them to the tippity-top of Parradamo Tor to transform-ethy them into Mimeo Feathers! Remember, I need-ethy three of them!
 9453: It will take-ethy all your skills and more to accomplish-ethy this task, but I know you can do it! You must-ethy be able to do it! I need-ethy you to be able to do it!
 9454: Excellent, this is everything I need-ethy! I'll get straight-ethy to work!
 9455: Oh, and make sure you find-ethy those three troublemakers before I finish repairing-ethy the mirror!
 9456: I must fix-ethy this mirror! I need to fix-ethy this mirror! I will fix-ethy this mirror!
 9457: It's fixed! I've fixed it! I've repaired-ethy the mirror!
 9458: Now, adventurer, it is time to put-ethy these false accusations to rest.
 9459: We must bring-ethy everyone here. Professor Koru-Moru, Doctor Shantotto, the Tarutaru Times, and of course, those three reputation-ruining children from Tavnazia...
 9460: What-ethy? They've already left!? What about-ethy this matter of questionable parentage!?
 9461: Simply astonishing-ethy. Who would've guessed-ethy they were the children of Karaha-Baruha...
 9462: Oh dear-ethy. I think-ethy all this excitement has finally caught up to me... So, what was it you wanted from me, then?
 9463: The Rhinostery directed-ethy you here? Ah, you wish to know-ethy about the allied expedition to the Northlands?
 9464: Since you assisted-ethy me in my recent crisis, I suppose-ethy I can tell you what I know. I must-ethy warn you, though, that precious little was discovered.
 9465: That expedition mostly served to prove-ethy the evil of the Northlands when two of the musketeers from the Bastokan contingent failed-ethy to return.
 9466: The terrible power in that land has been whispered-ethy about for many years, but I do not believe-ethy that anyone has yet managed to discern where or what this power truly is.
 9467: Minister Rukususu of the Rhinostery is continuing the investigation of the Northlands, but has discovered-ethy nothing more than a few trivial elements...
 9468: All I know-ethy is that it was the suspicious actions of Bastok that interfered-ethy with the original expedition.
 9469: But as for the details of what really happened-ethy back then, you should take-ethy your questions to Bastok or San d'Oria.
 9470: All I know-ethy about the Multinational Expedition is that it was the suspicious actions of Bastok that interfered-ethy with the research of the other members.
 9471: But as for the details of what really happened-ethy back then, you should take-ethy your questions to Bastok or San d'Oria.
 9472: Hm? Hm? Hm? Now that you mention-ethy it, I seem to recall-ethy that Karaha-Baruha was only a child when he visited-ethy Tavnazia...
 9473: I remember-ethy fighting with Minister Shantotto over who got to eat the tasty souvenirs he brought-ethy back... But that would mean-ethy...
 9474: Aren't you the adventurer that brought-ethy those three catastrophes to my doorstep!?
 9475: What disasters do you have-ethy in store for me today!?
 9476: I might have been caught-ethy off-guard by past events, but this time I'm ready for you!
 9477: Pardon my intrusion, but would this be the residence of the former Rhinostery minister?
 9478: <Player>! Thank the Goddess you're here. It seems you were one step ahead of me.
 9479: Well, well. Who is this enchanting-ethy young lady?
 9480: Hahaha! Did you think-ethy this would be enough to startle me silly?
 9481: I'll have you know-ethy I'm one of the calmest, most unshakable...
 9482: Is this the rrresidence of Doctor Yoran-Oran!?
 9483: Is the doctor arrround!?
 9484: I am the Mithran Tracker, Shikaree Y. Are you ready to meet your doom, Doctor Yoran-Oran?
 9485: A M-M-Mithran Tracker!?
 9486: Ordinarily, I would have you faint in terrorrr after you've heard what I've come to say.
 9487: Doctor Yoran-Oran. Surely you already suspect the reason I am here?
 9488: Come, come, there's no point in hiding it. We Mithran Trackers are able to sense that abhorrent power.
 9489: Abhorrent power...?
 9490: You Tarutaru have had little experience with this type of magical energy.
 9491: But the Mithra know it all too well. A stone pulsing with that darrrk power was the cause of bloodshed within my tribe.
 9492: You will hand the stone over to me immediately. The magicite. Now, sweetheart.
 9493: M-M-Miss Mithran Tracker... I understand-ethy your concerns. B-b-but are you sure you don't have me confused-ethy with somebody else?
 9494: I am an avid-ethy researcher of all things earthen, but I have-ethy no samples of this dreadful "magicite" you speak of...
 9495: Is that right, sugarplum? I don't usually like to say this up front, but I do so love the sight of brrright, gushing blood.
 9496: ...! I told you, I don't know anything about-ethy this stone! I can't give-ethy you what I don't have!
 9497: Eeek!
 9498: Enough of this! How dare you threaten this poor man with violence!
 9499: Do you truly believe this tyrannical method will lead to any sort of justice!? He swears that he does not have the magicite...!
 9500: If he doesn't have it, then maybe you carry the stone?
 9501: Or maybe this adventurerrr?
 9502: Heh heh heh... You're way off the mark, ladies!
 9503: !?
 9504: The only person carrying magicite here...is me!
 9505: For I am the great Prishe!
 9506: Prishe!
 9507: Hey, guys! Sorry to keep you hanging. But now that I'm here, everything'll be just peachy.
 9508: Just peachy!? Look at the situation we're in, you ninny!
 9509: That's far enough. You kitties play far too rough!
 9510: Doctor Shantotto!?
 9511: Shikaree Y, you rabid feline. You may be a Mithran Tracker, but I'll be a Cardian's mother before I let you run amok in this city of mine!
 9512: How I loathe complications.
 9513: And you, Yoran-Oran. Since I have the floor, I'll speak while I can!
 9514: This story's going to the press. Another illegitimate child, and Elvaan, no less!
 9515: Wha-!? No! You've got it all wrong-ethy!
 9516: Now to the heartaru of the matter. Prishe, show everyone the stone and end this meaningless chatter.
 9517: Show them why the magicite is not yours to give. Show them why it would be impossible for you to hand over the stone--and live.
 9518: What does she mean?
 9519: If that's what it takes. Nobody blink, now!
 9520: (How... How is this possible...?)
 9521: (The magicite...imbedded in herrr flesh...)
 9522: ...
 9523: Magicite is a stone that awakens an overwhelming darrrkness within the possessor.
 9524: The possessor eventually sheds any vestige of mortality, becoming an anathema to other living creatures.
 9525: Tell me, cutie pie. Why do you have that stone imbedded within you? Why have you not become an abhorrent being, feared by all?
 9526: An "abhorrent" being, huh? I just can't get away from that word, can I?
 9527: Well, I've stayed in this place long enough.
 9528: I gotta go throw down with Bahamut. The fate of Vana'diel is at stake!
 9529: Bahamut? You mean the Wyrmking, Bahamut?
 9530: No, my uncle Bahamut. Of course I mean the Wyrmking!
 9531: Under normal circumstances, it would be my duty as a Mithran Tracker to gain possession of that magicite by any means necessary, even if it meant carrrving it out of your hide...
 9532: But why don't you accompany me to Attohwa Chasm instead, honeybee?
 9533: There's someone there who should know a lot about that black magicite you have...
 9534: Hmm. That could be fun.
 9535: Prishe? What are you thinking!?
 9536: Ulmia, I'm gonna go with this cat-lady. She might be able to help me find the Star of Tavnazia.
 9537: Prishe!?
 9538: <Player>, take care of Ulmia!
 9539: And thanks for your help, Docs!
 9540: Docs...!?
 9541: Why is that cursed stone in Prishe's chest...?
 9542: And why has she decided to seek out the Star of Tavnazia after all this time? I must go to Attohwa Chasm as well...
 9543: I wish you would stop-ethy using my house as a stage for your exhibitions!
 9544: Those three evil children... That nasty Mithran Tracker... Have you ever heard-ethy of trespassing!?
 9545: Now unless you want me to call-ethy the Sibyl Guards, I suggest-ethy you be on your way to Attohwa Chasm!
 9546: We couldn't allow that Elvaan girl to stay with old Yoran-Oran. He has enough child problems to fill his little hands.
 9547: I brought her to my house, but I found myself in the proverbial rut. It took quite a few Fire spells to thaw out her frozen butt.
 9548: But I guess it was all worth my while. In the end I was able to hear the wonderful tale of her meeting with Diabolos and the following trial.
 9549: The magicite locked in her chest is more than what it seems. That stone is what pulled her into Diabolos's land of dreams.
 9550: However, her potty-mouthed highness obviously made the ruler of dreams quite upset. She lost her right to live in the strifeless world of Dynamis like that!
 9551: But she had the right idea, if you ask me. Where's the fun in living within a world without curses or misery!?
 9552: What now!? You want to know-ethy where the statue in Tavnazia came from?
 9553: I thought-ethy I already told you. The statue was covered in traces of soil similar to that found-ethy on the bottom of the Sea of Shu'Meyo.
 9554: But wait-ethy just a moment... Now that you mention it, there were also traces of Gustaberg soil mixed-ethy with the samples. I did not think-ethy anything of it at the time...
 9555: Why would-ethy there be two types of soil on the statue...?
 9556: Hey! You're an adventurer, right? You're supposed to help people with stuff, right? Take this letter to that [cool guy/cute lady] in the red hat, okay?
 9557: Excuse me, [mister/lady]. Would you take this letter to the [guy/lady] in the red hat?
 9558: Adventurer-[man/lady]! Could you take this letter to that funny [guy/lady] in the red hat?
 9559: I would like to take this letter to a certain [fellow/woman] wearing a red chapeaux; however, my parents do not allow me to stray far from home. Kind adventurer, might you deliver it in my stead?
 9560: Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
 9561: Whoa! Thanks, [misterrr/lady]!
 9562: Thank you so very much, [sir/ma'am]!
 9563: Another present? Sorry, but I only have two hands, [Mr./Ms.] Adventurer!
 9564: Wow! Another present! Ah... But I don't think I can carry all these home at once. Why don't you come back later?
 9565: Hey, didn't you just give me a prrresent? You're starrrting to scare me, [mister/lady]...
 9566: I just accepted a gift from you, kind [sir/ma'am]. I could not possibly accept another.
 9567: You've brought joy to the children of Vana'diel!
 9568: You've brought barrelfuls of joy to the children of Vana'diel!

 9570: Holiday trees are almost as beautiful as the Great Star Tree, kupo! I wish I could have one! A holiday tree, I mean. I don't think I could fit the Great Star Tree in my den, kupo...
 9571: What took you so long, kupo? I've been waiting here for hours! I'm tired and I want to go home, kupo...
 9572: Kupo? Did I forget to give you something...? No, you have it all. Now, you had better hurry. That craftsman seemed a little on edge, kupo.
 9573: I have all the data on your adventuring activity. But I'm only interested in how many enemies you've crushed and your KO'd loser proclivity.
 9574: Let's start out with your enemy carnage-warnage amounts... My, my. Either you justaru like to hide, or are not particular about large body counts.
 9575: Let's start out with your defeated enemy score... Oh. How very average. Wake me up if I startaru to snore.
 9576: Let's start out with your defeated enemy score... Oho, this is close to the figure I racked up during the Great War.
 9577: And now for your frequency of KO'd occasions... It seems that you've mastered the art of escapes and evasions! Your ability to survive must really irky-wirk your friends. Especially when you leave them behind to meet grisly ends!
 9578: And now for your frequency of KO'd occasions... A typical number, but you should learn to warp away from impending invasions! That is the reason the spell was invented. So many pointless defeats could have been easily prevented.
 9579: And now for your frequency of KO'd occasions... Oho, what a loser! I need no more persuasion. You must be the victim of some tasty-wasty curse! In all my years, I don't think I've seen a number much worse!
 9580: My last advice to you is to take a chance with an unfamiliar group. You mightaru find it refreshing to get out of your usual loop.
 9581: I have one piece of advice concerning your party today. Trusting in the strength of diversity won't lead you astray.
 9582: Visitaru every nation representative before you see the moogle again. Your evaluation from me here is done. But then...
 9583: No, you're not the one I was waiting to blast. You mightaru have gained another point to your KO'd score if I had miscast! Ohohohoho!
 9584: Festival time, kupo`!!! We moogles have come up with a new game for you to enjoy called "Azimuth Circle"!
 9585: Azimuth Circle is played in pairs! First, find a partner and make a party, kupo!
 9586: After you've done that, try to find a certain checkpoint located in this town! There are many checkpoints, but only one right answer, kupo!
 9587: However...you can only check three points, kupo! But don't worry--once you've checked a point, you can look at it again any number of times!
 9588: At each location lies a compass that points in the direction of your partner's special checkpoint! The directions will be indicated from the viewpoint of your partner, kupo`.
 9589: Find both of your special checkpoints and exchange the items you receive from them! Bring those items to us. We will give you a reward in exchange, kupo!
 9590: That's all there is to it, kupo! To participate, make a party of two and talk to a moogle!
 9591: That's all there is to it, kupo! Your partner seems to already be participating in the game. If you want to play together, ask your partner to cancel the current game and talk to a moogle again!
 9592: Will you participate in Azimuth Circle with your partner, kupo?
 9593: Play the game? [Ready to go!/I'll pass.]
 9594: When both of you are ready, talk to a moogle! Then the game will begin, kupo!
 9595: If you decide you want to play, just come with a friend, kupo!
 9596: Our records indicate that you are presently signed up for Azimuth Circle somewhere else, kupo. Would you like to cancel your participation there?
 9597: Well, kupo? You want to stop playing Azimuth Circle?
 9598: Cancel participation in Azimuth Circle? [Yes, freedom!/I'll keep playing, thanks.]
 9599: Your game has been cancelled. If you want to try again, speak to a moogle, kupo!
 9600: Wow, you found it! Enjoy your reward, kupo!
 9601: This isn't the item your partner found! We're still waiting on the item you got from your friend, kupo!
 9602: You must wait for your partner to finish, kupo! Would you like to cancel the current game instead?
 9603: We can only pass out one item to you each day, kupo`!
 9604: The direction of your partner's checkpoint is [east/southeast/south/southwest/west/northwest/north/northeast] as seen from your partner!
 9605: There is a compass here that points to the direction of your partner's checkpoint. The compass is pointing [east/southeast/south/southwest/west/northwest/north/northeast].
 9606: You see something lying on the ground!
 9607: You cannot check any more checkpoints.
 9608: <Player>'s badge flashes brightly.
 9609: What? Don't tell me you're interestarued in mercenary work!
 9610: That kind of thing doesn't appeal to me one bitaru. I'll stay right here in peaceful Windurst, where I'll never be reduced to barbaric behavior.
 9611: But who wants to spendy-wendy their life dealing with the head lady-in-waiting's moods? Being a mercenary in the Near Easty-weasty doesn't sound all that bad to me...
 9612: We should help those who are in trouble-o-rouble.
 9613: I bet the people of Aht Urhgan have problems-o-roblems. You should become a mercenary and help them-o-em out!
 9614: Ohohoho! Such a tatty old badge, but you're proud--can this be? You're baring your nature--no shame--for all to see!
 9615: If you become an Orastery mercenary and change your foul ways, you can wear the strongest equipment for the rest of your days! That does mean, although, if your days aren't yet done, you won't be able to remove it, but that's part of the fun!
 9616: I'm looking for baddie-waddies. This shiny-winy badge proves that you're a good guy, though. I want lots and lots of them!
 9617: Chomomo's badge flashes brightly.
 9618: Stay on your guard! Don't get caught up in adults' sneaky trrricks.
 9619: Juna Moshal's badge flashes brightly.
 9620: You had better take carrre when dealing with the Cardians. This is just between you and me, but those machines go crrrazy sometimes.
 9621: I've heard that there are similar creations in the Near East. I wonder if they have the same prrroblems...
 9622: Hello! When it comes to celebrating and festivities, I'm your moogle, kupo! Today I'm here on behalf of the M.H.M.U. to reward adventurers for their hard work in protecting our cities!
 9623: Greetings from the Mog House Management Union! When it comes to celebrating and festivities, I'm your moogle, kupo!
 9624: I don't know what we'd do without you... Keep it up, kupo!
 9625: Why are you talking to me? You should be out there aiding [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst]'s fight to prove you are better than those [San d'Orians/Bastokers/Windurstians], kupo!
 9626: Congratulations on your victory, [San d'Orian/Bastoker/Windurstian]! Your nation has been selected Crystal War MVN, kupo! As a reward, I shall teleport you to any nation of your choice!
 9627: Where would like to go, kupo? [Nowhere./San d'Oria./Bastok./Windurst.]
 9628: Happy travels, kupo!
 9629: Moogles from across Vana'diel have heard of [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst]'s recent success in collecting crystal shards, and have come bearing gifts! For the next few days, [San d'Orian/Bastoker/Windurstian] vendors will be selling specialty goods from everywhere imaginable, kupo!
 9630: Oooh! It's <Player>! Your shard-collecting skills have left us Moogles in awe. It's my honor to present you with this special present, kupo!
 9631: ***GM Commands*** ***Use with CAUTION!***
 9632: Set this area's A flag to: [Nowhere./San d'Oria./Bastok./Windurst.]
 9633: Switch on this area's B flag? [No (OFF)./Yes (ON).]
 9634: Flag settings complete. A Flag: [Nowhere/San/Bas/Win] B Flag: [OFF/ON]
 9635: The previous Adventurer Appreciation Campaign was a resounding success, kupo! However, there were a lot of people who didn't have the opportunity to collect their $0.
 9636: It wouldn't be fair if those poor souls missed out on such an incredible item, so I've brought a whole new bag of them!
 9637: Ah, but my list shows that you already received a ring. I'm sorry, <Player>. I am not allowed to give you a new one, kupo!
 9638: Hrmmm... It looks like you weren't registered with the MHMU at the time of the campaign. I'm sorry, but I'm not allowed to give newcomers a ring.
 9639: Oh, and my list shows that you haven't received $0 yet, kupo! Here, you can have this one, but be careful not to throw it away, as you'll never be able to get another...ever!
 9640: Hey! The MHMU has a basketful of special goodies for all the brave adventurers who work hard to protect the poor little moogles of Vana'diel, kupo.
 9641: Oh, and your name is on my list, <Player>! Let me show you the items you can choose from...
 9642: Choose wisely... [Never mind./$0./$1./$2./$3./$4./$5./$6./$7.]
 9643: Hey! The MHMU has a basketful of special goodies for all the brave adventurers who work hard to protect the poor little moogles of Vana'diel, kupo. Ah, but it looks like I have nothing for you! Sorry!
 9644: The MHMU appreciates your sustained support! May you use our present for productive purposes, kupo!
 9645: Should you get your mighty mitts on anything like $0, make it known by trading them to me. I'll give you a great gift in return, kupo.
 9646: So you've deemed it time to trade in a ticket-like $0, huh? For what exemplars of enjoyment will you exchange it, kupo?
 9647: What do you want in exchange? [Nothing./Equipment./Items./Currency.]
 9648: What equipment? [Never mind./$1./$2./$3./$4./$5./$6./$7./$8./$9./$10./$11./$12./$13./$14./$15./$16./Previous page./Next page.]

 9651: You can't carry any more $0, kupo. Please pick another provision.
 9652: You sure you're perfectly pleased with $0, kupo?
 9653: You sure you're perfectly pleased with $1 $0 , kupo?
 9654: Are you completely confident you want $1 [Conquest Points/Imperial Standing/Allied Notes/Bayld/Fishermen's Guild points/Carpenters' Guild points/Blacksmiths' Guild points/Goldsmiths' Guild points/Weavers' Guild points/Tanners' Guild points/Boneworkers' Guild points/Alchemists' Guild points/Culinarians' Guild points], kupo?
 9655: Well, are you? [You know it, poet./No, I'm not, tot.]
 9656: Your Imperial Standing has increased!
 9657: You have earned $0 Allied Note[/s]!
 9658: Obtained: $0 guild points.
 9659: What'sa matta with ya, [son/missy]? Ya thinkin' about walkin' arounda these here parts witha no map? Ya gotta be crazy!
 9660: When I was a young bambina likesa you, I's seen my share of loot. But over the years, I learneda one thing--the sweetest treasure lies outta sight. Thatsa what I'm collectin'.
 9661: Them crazy Sahagins livin' 'round here trades thesea strange dolls with the pirates for weapons. Now if I could gets my hands on one of them tasty pieces...

 9663: I hears that if you wants to talk to one of them crazy Anticans livin' 'round here, you gots to use some strange instrument. Now if I could gets my hands on one of them tasty pieces...
 9664: Unfortunately, to keeps their secret, thosea guys always breaks the goods up into four pieces.
 9665: If you can finds all four, you brings thema back here to yours truly. I'll make it worth your while.
 9666: What'sa that you gots there? Hmmm... It looks likea one of those fishy Sahagins' goods.
 9667: What'sa that you gots there? Hmmm... It looks likea one of those slimy Tonberries' goods.
 9668: What'sa that you gots there? Hmmm... It looks likea one of those creepy-crawly Anticans' goods.
 9669: I needs to check this out to make sure you're not tryin' to pulla fast one.
 9670: You did some good work, kid. Now it'sa time for me to keep up my end of the bargain.
 9671: Here, lets me marka your map...

 9673: What!? You goes where I tells ya, and you'll havea no problem findin' the stash. And don't ya forget your $0!
 9674: Whaddo I look like here, a charity?
 9675: It looks like something is buried here. If you had $0 you could dig it up.
 9676: You dig up a strange wooden casket!
 9677: But your $7 breaks in the process.
 9678: You find $0 in the box!
 9679: You find $0 gil in the box!
 9680: Obtained: #.
 9681: Obtained $0 gil.
 9682: Your inventory is full. You cannot carry any more items.
 9683: You must be closer to the spot to dig.
 9684: There is nothing out of the ordinary here.
 9685: This is the entrance to Windurst's residential area, where there is a "Mog House" prepared for your use, taru.
 9686: This is the entrance to Windurst's residential area, where there are Mog Houses and Rent-a-Rooms available for your use, taru.
 9687: A Mog House is your own personal apartment room provided for your convenience, taru.
 9688: Within your Mog House, you can store items, change jobs, heal your HP and MP, and so on, taru.
 9689: You are free to use the room as you please. Anyway, enough of my explanation. Go ahead and kupo-ing rest up, taru.
 9690: Phew. Didn't want to put the both of us through that again, taru!
 9691: What do you need now, taru?
 9692: The Mog Houses of the following party members are open for visits, taru.
 9693: Okay, follow me, taru.
 9694: What do you wish to do? [Nothing in particular./Ask for an explanation of Mog Houses./Visit the Mog House of a party member.]
 9695: Whose Mog House will you visit? [Never mind./%1/%2/%3/%4/%5/%6/%7/%8/%9/%10/%11/%12/%13/%14/%15/%16/%17]
 9696: That Mog House is not currently open for visits.
 9697: Oho! Welcome, my adventuring friend!
 9698: Let me guess--you've a curse you'd like me to mend.
 9699: I see, I see...
 9700: Clattering shutters and rattling doors? A most sinister incantation, this hex of yours...
 9701: But fear not for your humble dwelling. The peerless Shantotto will administer a proper dispelling! O`hohoho!
 9702: Sadly, I fear there's just one snag. You see, a vital ingredient has gone missing from my reagent bag...
 9703: Yes, $6 will be needed, methinks, in order to root out this baleful jinx.
 9704: Bring me what I seek, and we shall address the matter you bespeak.
 9705: 
 9706: Still dawdling about? There's a curse to dispel--I suggest you move out!
 9707: In Outer Horutoto, my $3 lies. Concealed in a very special Cardian--so keep peeled your eyes!
 9708: Why yes, precisely! This should do quite nicely.
 9709: Excellent, and very well! Now, off to Jeuno--we've a curse to dispel!
 9710: Why don't you go on ahead? I must find someone to watch over the laboratory in my stead.
 9711: Oh, and I'm sorry, but it's my business stance. I'll require my payment of $0 gil in advance.
 9712: Are we clear, dear? (Current gil: $1) [Fine, here's your money./What!? This isn't funny...]
 9713: You're clearly a [man/woman] who can recognize a good deal. For powers of my magnitude, that price is a steal! O`hohoho!
 9714: <Ahem>--Allow me to say this with consummate clarity. I am not in the business of running a charity!
 9715: If you're too cheap to pay, then off with you.
 9716: And you can bid your house and bat-winged friend adieu!
 9717: Yoran-Oran, my good sir-areeno! Might I trouble you for a moment-aroony of your time-diddily-ime?
 9718: Why, Principal Koru-Moru. A rare treat it is to see you here-ethy. But of course, my time-ethy is at your disposal.
 9719: Then let me cut right-aroo to the chase. Loath as I am to alarm-a-dilly you, I must confess-doodley-ess my concern over Doctor Shantotto's recent ding-dang-doodley behavior.
 9720: Doctor Shantotto...?
 9721: That the doctor's predilections defy logic has always been common knowledge-ethy, has it not? I don't see any cause for concern-ethy.
 9722: That's well and true as a giggity-goobbue, but this time I can't shake-aroo the feeling that something is a-brew-areeno.
 9723: Could it be that the ambitious doctor is do-diddily-dabbling in something so unworldly and twisted-aroo...
 9724: ...it mightily-ightily cause unimaginable strife to be unleashed-kapeeshed upon the world?
 9725: My dear Koru-Moru, I daresay you're simply-ethy being over-sensitive to one of Doctor Shantotto's trademark mood swing-ethies. Not every endeavor she undertakes necessarily-ethy causes a stir, after all.
 9726: Whatever our eccentric peer-ethy might be up to, it's likely to be just a passing fad. You waste-ethy your energy in worry. Now, if you'll just make-ethy yourself comfortable, old chap, I'll pour you a steaming hot cup-ethy of freshly brewed Windurstian tea!
 9727: Hrmm... I sincerely hope-diddily-ope it's as you say, Yoran-Oran. I sincerely hope-diddily-doodley-ope it's as you say...
 9728: To our woe-ethy, in the days that followed, we were made to sorely regret our inaction-ethy despite the all-too-obvious warning signs...
 9729: Wrap your minds around a picture of perfection, surpassed only by me and my immaculate complexion.
 9730: You'll find not a single hole in my theory; it is pristine.
 9731: The greatest masterwork the magicking world has ever seen!
 9732: Magekind is long overdue to take its next big step.
 9733: With the pure genius of yours truly, from a golden new era we shan't be kept!
 9734: A moment from now, it'll all make sense. Without further ado, let the magic commence!
 9735: Hark, portal, I demand of thee! Open up and set me free!
 9736: Hm?
 9737: Wh-what...?
 9738: That my calculations were in err is beyond comprehension! That I could blunder so defies the established convention!
 9739: Some time later...
 9740: The time has come for us to make our meteoric rise. All who oppose will be dealt an ample serving of demise!
 9741: We venture forth to conquer Vana'diel and claim our birthright.
 9742: Now and forever more, the fire of the Shantotto Empire shall burn bright!
 9743: Domina Shantotto!!!
 9744: Domina Shantotto!!!
 9745: We shall teach the world a lesson it shan't soon forget:
 9746: Our armies are unstoppable, so do naught that you might regret!
 9747: Go now with our blessing, we have adversaries to fell. Carry out that which makes us proud and does our spirit well!
 9748: Ohohoho...
 9749: O`hohohohoho!
 9750: Scene selection. [1-1/1-2/1-3/Skip.]
 9751: And so it was that the Shantotto Empire faded from the face of Vana'diel, and peace was restored to the land.
 9752: However, no guarantee exists that another dark shadow, like in form, will not emerge and threaten to rob the world of its light.
 9753: Until such time, we can only pray from the bottom of our hearts that this period of tranquility will endure forever more...
 9754: Yoran-Oran, my good sir-areeno! Could you spare me a moment-aroony of your time-doodley-ime?
 9755: But of course, Principal Koru-Moru. How may I serve-ethy you this day?
 9756: I wish not to alarm-a-doody you, but Doctor Shantotto's recent ding-dang-doodley behavior strikes me as odd-areeno...
 9757: ......
 9758: Ohohoho... O`hohohohoho!!!
 9759: Greetings, friend! I am a synergy engineer, dispatched from the Institute to maintain the furnaces you see beside me. I also have knowledge and services to share with fellow synergists, if that is what you desire.
 9760: I see from the puzzled expression on your face that you are unfamiliar with our discipline. To use these furnaces, you will first need to obtain $6.
 9761: Piqued your curiosity, have I? Then you should speak with Hildolf, our institute director, at his laboratory in the Bastok Metalworks. He's always eager to welcome a new synergist to our ranks.
 9762: May I be of service? [Not now./Learn recipes./Check fewell./Replenish fewell./Purchase materials./Receive training./Trade cinder./Get information.]
 9763: Recipes, you say? Let's see what we have that's suitable for your level of expertise...
 9764: ...I'm sorry. I'm afraid there's nothing I can teach you at the moment.
 9765: I've got it! How about $0? Mind you, it'll require a certain level of skill...

 9784: There you go. That doesn't sound so hard, now, does it?
 9785: But of course! If you'll just allow me to inspect your $3 for a moment...
 9786: Your fewell supply would appear to be as follows: o o $1 o!$2 o"$3 o#$4 o$$5 o%$6 o&$7.
 9787: Running low? We can fill you up for a nominal fee.
 9788: Replenish fewell? [Yes./No.]
 9789: Looking for a fewell fill-up, you say? Then you've come to the right place!
 9790: ...Hm? Why, your tank is already full to bursting. Come back again if you need a refill.
 9791: Now let's see here... According to my calculations, I can fill you up to capacity for $0 gil. How does that sound?
 9792: Pay $0 gil? [Deal!/No thanks.]
 9793: Understood. Take care to monitor your reserves closely, lest you run out of fewell in the midst of a crucial procedure.
 9794: I'm afraid you haven't the requisite gil, friend. Perhaps another time.
 9795: Excellent! Now we just pop open your $3 here, and...
 9796: There you go. Filled to the brim with a fresh batch of fewell! Can you smell those fumes? Mmm-mmm!
 9797: Your $3 has been filled to capacity!
 9798: You hand the synergy engineer $0 gil.
 9799: How do you expect me to do that when your $3 is sitting inside a furnace, friend? You'll have to come back after you've finished synergizing.
 9800: Materials, you say? But of course! Have a look at our selection.
 9801: Purchase something? [Not today./$1 $0 : $2 gil./$3 $0 : $4 gil./$5 $0 : $6 gil.]
 9802: For $1 $0 , that comes to $2 gil.
 9803: Ah, another dedicated synergist looking to refine [his/her] technique. Excellent! That motivation will serve you well.
 9804: ...But I'm afraid you'll need [/ever so slightly more/a bit more/more/a good deal more/considerably more] experience before you're ready to benefit from my training.
 9805: And yes, it would seem you're at just the right skill level to receive my training. So, what will it be? Which technique would you like to improve?
 9806: Train in which technique? [Cancel./Fewell feeding. (Current Lv.: $0)/Furnace thwacking. (Current Lv.: $1)/Pressure handle. (Current Lv.: $2)/Safety lever. (Current Lv.: $3)/Furnace repair. (Current Lv.: $4)/Fewell recycling. (Current Lv.: $5)]
 9807: You wish to improve your [/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique. Is this correct?
 9808: It would seem your [/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique already exceeds my own. There is no more I can teach you.
 9809: Train in this technique? [Yes./No.]
 9810: Very well! Now listen up, watch closely, and try to follow along...
 9811: ...See, you take this part here, and... Yes, yes...just like that...
 9812: ...Now steady here, or you'll be picking exploded furnace shrapnel out of your face for a week! Phew, that was a close one...
 9813: ...And by applying Corollary Five of Hildolf's Third Theory of Inverse Transfocal Equilibrium, we find that...
 9814: <Clink, clank...clunk> ...Er, let's try that once more...
 9815: ...Superb! A quick learner, I see. If only all my students were as attentive as you!
 9816: Your [/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique increases to level $1!
 9817: Research into the composition of the cinder produced as a side effect of synergy just might lead to the next breakthrough in our field. Provide us with samples for analysis, and we will gladly reward your contributions.
 9818: Trade in your cinder? (Currently: $0 Pz) [Not now./$1: $2 Pz./$3: $4 Pz./$5: $6 Pz./$7: $8 Pz./$9: $10 Pz./$11: $12 Pz./$13: $14 Pz./$15 gil: $16 Pz.]
 9819: This is what you want, correct?
 9820: Make the exchange? [Yes./No.]
 9821: It would appear that you lack the necessary quantity of cinder for that transaction.
 9822: Excellent! And this is yours. May it serve you well!
 9823: You transferred $0 Pz of cinder to the synergy engineer. $1 Pz [remains/remain] in your possession.
 9824: Ask about what? [Nothing./Synergy furnaces./Synergy overview./Synergy procedure./Synergy recipes./Fewell replenishment./Materials for sale./Synergy techniques./Trading cinder.]
 9825: The synergy furnaces you see around town are provided as a public service by the Bastokan Institute of Synergy Research, to ensure that no synergist is ever far away from the tools of their trade.
 9826: The synergist must provide his or her own $3, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process. Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.
 9827: Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.
 9828: Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town. If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.
 9829: You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis. It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.
 9830: Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results. The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.
 9831: This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call "fewell." To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!
 9832: As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require. Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.
 9833: With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing! Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.
 9834: The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be. In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!
 9835: But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.
 9836: If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.
 9837: Take heart, though, as any materials inside your $3 will remain intact. You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.
 9838: Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.
 9839: Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.
 9840: Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions. Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!
 9841: You may be asking yourself, "Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?"
 9842: Here's the good news: you don't have to! For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.
 9843: The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand. At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.
 9844: Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of $0, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.
 9845: Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that $0 may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.
 9846: Mind you, $0 is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it. Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.
 9847: Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped. May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!
 9848: First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply. You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.
 9849: You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe. Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.
 9850: Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy. If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.
 9851: You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically. Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.
 9852: From here, it becomes a race against the clock! Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.
 9853: Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task. First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.
 9854: Next, you can begin to feed fewell into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration. Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.
 9855: However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions. Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.
 9856: If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you'll want to employ the safety lever and pressure handle to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.
 9857: You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition. Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.
 9858: The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues. You'll need to perform periodic furnace repair should the furnace near its breaking point.
 9859: It is also possible to recycle strewn fewell during synergy. While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.
 9860: This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute. As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.
 9861: As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable. There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.
 9862: For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger. Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!
 9863: You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.
 9864: In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well. To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.
 9865: Now let us return to the synergy process itself. As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.
 9866: If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance. The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.
 9867: Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills! Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...
 9868: What's an elemental surge, you ask? Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.
 9869: The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?
 9870: ...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell. There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.
 9871: Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe. We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.
 9872: Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients. There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.
 9873: Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.
 9874: The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own. The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.
 9875: In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as $0 can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.
 9876: # cannot be attached directly. First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of $0 can then be embedded.
 9877: The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment. There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.
 9878: If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.
 9879: As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.
 9880: You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures. It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.
 9881: Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant. Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.
 9882: My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale. The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!
 9883: The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.
 9884: Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach. Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.
 9885: To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.
 9886: When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.
 9887: Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call revertant.
 9888: Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state! Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.
 9889: As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call "fewell." The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.
 9890: Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.
 9891: To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!
 9892: For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.
 9893: That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your $3! What could be easier?
 9894: Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of $0? If so, you've come to the right place!
 9895: We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as mordant for sale. With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.
 9896: Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff. You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.
 9897: Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant. As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.
 9898: Ah, synergy techniques! Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.
 9899: My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques. We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.
 9900: Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge. For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.
 9901: Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents. You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.
 9902: Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer. These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.
 9903: The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills. To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.
 9904: Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.
 9905: Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation. Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.
 9906: We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.
 9907: It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold! Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.
 9908: Wondering if your $0 can be outfitted with evolith, are you? Well, you've come to the right place!
 9909: A quick look at its composition should tell us all we need to know. Let's see here...
 9910: Congratulations! Your $0 can indeed hold [an/another] evolith aperture. A $2-shaped aperture, to be exact...
 9911: ...Suitable for evolith of the following size and elemental affinity: Maximum size: $1 / [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&].
 9912: ...Suitable for evolith of the following sizes and elemental affinities: Maximum size: $1 / Affinity: [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&]. Maximum size: $3 / Affinity: [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&].
 9913: ...Suitable for evolith of the following sizes and elemental affinities: Maximum size: $1 / Affinity: [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&]. Maximum size: $3 / Affinity: [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&]. Maximum size: $5 / Affinity: [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&].
 9914: ...Suitable for evolith of the following sizes and elemental affinities: Maximum size: $1 / Affinity: [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&]. Maximum size: $3 / Affinity: [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&]. Maximum size: $5 / Affinity: [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&]. Maximum size: $7 / Affinity: [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&].
 9915: That is all. Should you wish to have any other pieces of equipment analyzed, you know where to find us.
 9916: Hmm... I'm afraid your $0 cannot house any more apertures.
 9917: ...Alas. It's a shame, but it appears your $0 cannot be etched.
 9918: Hmm, what's this? It would seem that your $0 cannot be etched at this time.
 9919: Do you love synergizing as much as I love synergizing!? 'Cause if you do, you're gonna loooooove the recipes I have for you!

 9923: Oh, the $0? Why, that's one of my favorite recipes, too! What skills does it require? Let's see here...
 9924: Well, look at this. All you need is a furnace and your own Goddess-given synergy skills to make that one! Ain't synergy grand?
 9925: Wait! No, don't tell me. You strike me as a [man/woman] who's looking to learn a thing or two about synergy.
 9926: Learn about synergy? [Not today./Teach me!/Just give me $6.]
 9927: A life without intellectual curiosity is a life hardly worth living. Should your eyes one day open to this truth, you are free to return.
 9928: I thought you'd never ask! Synergy is both an art and a science: an evolution--nay, a revolution--in synthesis.
 9929: Using $6 in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.
 9930: What we call $6 serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.
 9931: Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists. The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.
 9932: Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your $3 into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.
 9933: Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.
 9934: Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium. The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.
 9935: You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.
 9936: But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.
 9937: A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.
 9938: That's why smart synergists synergize in numbers. Too many culinarians might spoil the broth, but when it comes to synergy, it's the more the merrier!
 9939: An aspiring synergist, I see! If you're looking for $6, you've certainly come to the right place.
 9940: I can sell you a splendid entry-level model for $0 gil. A small price to pay to embark on a lifelong journey of scientific discovery, wouldn't you say?
 9941: $0 gil, paid in full!
 9942: As promised, here's your $3. And because I like your enthusiasm, I've even stocked it to the brim with fewell for you! How's that for a deal?
 9943: The synergist must provide his or her own $3, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process. Synergy furnaces themselves may be used free of charge.
 9944: Should you wish to learn more about the science of synergy, seek out one of the engineers stationed throughout the town.
 9945: Don'tcha think dat furrowed brow and cocked head o' yers escaped me. Yer int'rested in dis chest, ain'tcha? Well, ya gots good right tah be, 'cause even us Gobbies is fascimanated wit' it. It's some sorta myst'ry box salvaged from a shipwreck in da Gugru Blue! Da mysterious part is dat what goes in don't necessarilies come out!
 9946: While I may tout its amazin'ness, don'tcha think fer even a second dat I's at liberty tah divulge hows we came by it. Still, I likes yer face. It's a kind face, one dat says ya won't stabs me in da back, which is more'n I can say fer my own mum. Lemme shows ya how to use dis myst'ry box.
 9947: Bah-dah-bah-dahm dah-daaahm! Ya open da chest. Dat's it. And da kicker be dat I'm da one doin' da openin'. Ya just gets tah stand dere gawkin' in astonishmament. Easy gig, no?
 9948: Oh yeah, 'fore I forget. What good's a chest if ya ain't gots da key? Well, da key to dis chest is da fine art o' waitin'.
 9949: Ya wantsa know da hows n' da whys? Well da bosses had our tinkers tinkerin' on troo' da night and dey foun' dat...
 9950: Well, dey foun' dat we really gots no idea why da loot changes. Anywho, ya's wanna wait 'n wait 'n wait, den keep on waitin' some more. "Good things come tah dose who wait," right? Well, da longer ya wait, da gooder da thing...maybe. Ya just never know wit' a myst'ry box.
 9951: Also, I calls da amount o' time ya's waited yer circa...circama...circamadamian...ugh, yer "daily tally." It ain't just da name dat's catchy, though. Da higher yer tally, da gooder yer goods get! Can't get much good--er, simpler dan dat.
 9952: Finally, ya opens da chest. Oooh, I can barely contain m'self thinkin' o' all da riches I--er, ya could have!
 9953: Oh, dat's right! Heyheyhey, got any items ya won't be needin'? If so, fork 'em over 'n yer daily tally'll increase! Mebbe not by much, but dat's better'n nothin', am I right?
 9954: And dere's no better feelin' dan takin' trash and turnin' it into treasure. It's pramactically a new kind o' alchemy! But don't go gung ho 'n overfills da thing 'til its hinges break. Myst'ry boxes don't grow on goobbues, y'know.
 9955: Plus, I'll be here tah stops ya if I sees ya stuffin' whole Gobbiebags worth o' possessions in dere, so don't worry yer oversized noggin' over and over over it. Whats was I sayin' again? Ugh, never mind.
 9956: Sadly, howsever, anodda myst'ry 'bout dis chest is dat it won't takes just any ol' bauble. It has da taste o' a picky peiste--it feasts upon nothin' but da rarest and unique-est o' artifacts.
 9957: Lastly, since we don't knows where da items go once inside, ya ain't gettin' nothin' back datcha put in. Ya reap whatcha sow, and da weather ain't always condusimasive to a good harvest, am I right? My condolemances in advance for any losses ya mights incur from da myst'ry box's fickle nature.

 9962: Dese're some "special dials," an' I gots no inklin' what's inside. Ya gots tah open 'em yerself tah find out what treasures lie within!
 9963: Oh ho, I's forgettin' tah explain somethin' to ya. See dese "special dials"? Dey're super primo, but I still no know wut's gonna be in dere.
 9964: So I's not be takin' no responsibility if somethin' weird 'n wacky comes out. Got it? Ya open it, ya keep it.

 9988: Nah, it just won't woik. I's did my best, but yer daily tally just won't go no higher. Ya ain't gonna get no prizes by hoardin' yer points, so stop bein' such a Greedalox and use 'em.

10057: Right, Uka? Uka? Leaping lizards, where could she have run off to?
10058: Mwahahahaha!
10059: Who's there!?
10060: Ah, Mumor. How many years has it been?
10061: Cinnamon and gravy, it's Ullegore! I won't let you wipe the smiles off my adoring fans' faces!
10062: Oho, but wipe I will! Uka, come!
10063: I am herrre, Lord Ullegore.
10064: N-no!
10065: Snap this little twig in two.
10066: By your command.
10067: Uka...? What's wrong? Why, after all we've been through?
10068: We're not friends, Mumor. We never were. I exist only to serve his eminence, Lord Ullegore.
10069: Eeep!
10070: Stand strong! Believe in the bonds between you and your prancing partner!
10071: Diva!
10072: Ullegore underhandedly usurped Uka's will with wicked wizardry! So stop staring and samba her back to her senses!
10073: And now you turn your back on me, Diva. Very well. I shall sip your tears tonight as well!
10074: W-wait... Why am I supporting such a second-rate starlet?
10075: Well, I positively planted my paw in it. No going back now! Go get 'em, girl!
10076: Don't let Ullegore frazzle you, Uka! I'll bounce those cobwebs right out of your head!
10077: C'mon, everyone! Let's show Ullegore the true meaning of dance!
10078: Grk...
10079: Keep at it!
10080: Thanks to all your help, I'm beginning to feel tingly and sparkly! Here we go, my lovelies!
10081: Neo Crystal Jig!!!
10082: Super Crusher Jig!!!
10083: Shining Summer Samba!!!
10084: Lovely Miracle Waltz!!!
10085: Urgh... It's my turrrn, now!
10086: Ouchies!
10087: Please, I need your help!
10088: Uka...why? Why don't you remember me?
10089: Mumor!
10090: Mwahahaha! And so ends the story of the Mighty Maidens--not with a bang, but a whimper!
10091: Never shall any in this land know fun again!
10092: Noooooo...!
10093: And so it came to pass that Mumor was vanquished by her archnemesis and an unending doldrum blanketed land and sea alike.
10094: The only way this most terrible of fates can be reversed is by lending Mumor strength and spirit, that she may rise once more!
10095: M-Mumor? What...happened?
10096: Impossible!
10097: Uka! You had the butterflies doing laps around my stomach!
10098: Curse you, Mumor! I would have gotten away with it if it hadn't been for you meddling spectators!
10099: But don't rest on your laurels just yet!
10100: He's...he's a person!?
10101: Countless eons have I flitted from star to star, bringing to each the sweet embrace of boredom.
10102: But this clamorous world you call Vana'diel refuses to receive my gift.
10103: Fine. I can still wrap this world in lethargy and ennui, and neither you, Diva, or Uka can stop me!
10104: No! As long as there are light and smiles in this world, I will rise up to stop you!
10105: That's our cue, everyone--Firesday Night Fever time!
10106: Pardon me for breaking the fourth wall, but perhaps an explanation is in order.
10107: Firesday Night Fever describes the special moments in a songstress's career when she is so intimately connected to her fan base that she can activate her "Dancing Force" without the need of any outward shows of support!
10108: Hmph. You two are pathetic.
10109: Goodbye, Ullegore, you've had a nice run!t
10110: But the Maidens are here, bringing Vana'diel fun!t
10111: The time has arrived to give the dark lord his due!t
10112: And so, evil spirits, I have this to say: pooh-pooh!t
10113: Wh-what is the meaning of--!
10114: Now's our chance, Mumor!
10115: To see the inverted rainbow of your smile...
10116: We'll dance to the abyss and back!
10117: Mighty Maidens Mumor and Uka!
10118: Eternal Vana Illusion!!!
10119: Graaaaaaaaah!!!
10120: We surrre gave him his comeuppance!
10121: H-how could I...?
10122: Wow, you're way worse at winning than I am!
10123: You want me to leave your precious festival alone? Fine. I acquiesce.
10124: Really? 'Cause if you break your promise, it'll be a thousand pricklies for you.
10125: One thousand, ten thousand...bah, who can keep count?
10126: C'mon, Mumor! Give him ten thousand right in the kisser!
10127: Listen, guys! He hasn't broken his promise yet!
10128: You are a curious one, Mumor. Most would relish in their victory and rub the loser's nose in it...but not you.
10129: Though I have lost, I do not feel any ill will. Is this what "fun" is?
10130: Okay, everyone! We've brought peace and happiness back to Vana'diel, so now it's time... I'm finally going to sing!
10131: M-M-Mumor! D-d-don't!
10132: Tra laaa laaaaaa...&$26"~$!!!
10133: Hm? Why isn't everyone cheering?
10134: M-Mumor...I told you...not to...
10135: This whole time...you were tone-deaf...
10136: No...my number-one nemesis...all along was...some squawking sham!?
10137: Oh come now, everyone! You're giving me a bad case of the uglies!
10138: My darling festivalgoers, you brought a spring back to Uka's step and a tear to my eye! I love you...each and every one of you!
10139: Why, without you, Ullegore would be running rampant across the land!
10140: Next time I'll have a super-sweet melody prepared, so keep those ears open and wait with bated breath!
10141: But for now...enjoy the festival!

10150: Kupopo... Mumor's woeful one-woman wail split my skull in six!
10151: Oh dear. I knew I shouldn't have tried to hit that high note...
10152: M-Mumor! Don't worry! It's...nothing that practice couldn't fix, kupo.
10153: You don't have to butter me up. I know that my vocal cards aren't cut out for it. But heavens, what good is an idol who can't sing?
10154: How do you respond? [Different strokes for different folks!/Hey, you've got the looks!]
10155: That's sweet as sugar of you to say. I promise I'll work really, really hard for next year!
10156: Well, that's another shade of white! I didn't use Daddy's wand, so why...?
10157: Well done, my dear. Well done.
10158: Daddy!
10159: Your spirit and emotions were dazzling, and your adoring fans were with you every step of the way. If anyone is worthy of being called an idol, it's you.
10160: Do you really think I'm worthy? But...my singing...
10161: Being an idol isn't only about singing and dancing.
10162: It's about winning the hearts of your fans and having them support you through thick and thin.
10163: I raised you to be an idol so that one day you might save the world. A father could be no prouder of his daughter.
10164: Oh, Daddy...
10165: My fine [lad/young woman], your support of Mumor throughout the years has meant the world to me.
10166: This I promise--as dedicated as her fans are to her, she is twice as dedicated to them.
10167: And it's thanks to you that I've shaken off the heebie-jeebies and am ready to face a new day!
10168: I have a special place in my heart for each and every one of my fans--but especially you!
10169: I've been waiting for you, kupo! Mumor, the shining starlet herself, has slunk her way onto the streets to see you!
10170: I'm so glad you're here! With all my singing and battling, I never seem to find the time to meet my wonderful fans!
10171: I was positively tickled to see you in the crowd. Can I ask your name?
10172: <Player>, your dancing was positively peachy!t
10173: Remember how Diva called forth another me?
10174: You can surely do the same thing, too.
10175: I can feel it in the way you lend Uka and me strength.
10176: After all, it must mean we have those three special bonds...
10177: Could you give it a try? Just for me?
10178: To see the inverted rainbow of your smile...
10179: Psst! That's your cue!
10180: You mean you don't know how to finish off the catchphrase? Well, Uka's not here, so I'll have to think of a separate one for you...
10181: ...We'll sing and twist until the sun shines through!
10182: Yes, that's perfect!t
10183: Wow! It's like I came up with it myself!
10184: Now we can be together all year round, not just at the Sunbreeze Festival!

10186: A revival of Mumor's final performance will soon be underway.
10187: As always, your steadfast support can greatly affect the outcome of this magnificent show. Let me tell you how.
10188: Like any good diva, Mumor requires the cheers of her fans to unlock her true potential in the struggles that lie ahead. In short, your emotions are her strength.
10189: /clapping, /cheering, and /waving all have a positive effect on her, and switching between them has a greater effect than repeating the same one over and over.
10190: When Mumor has received enough accolades from her fans, she will unleash one of her powerful dance moves. When she does, dance along with her!
10191: Her dances include the following:
10192: Shining Summer Samba: /dance1 Lovely Miracle Waltz: /dance2
10193: Neo Crystal Jig: /dance3 Super Crusher Jig: /dance4

10199: A super-special Starlight Celebration to you, ambitious adventurer!
10200: What am I saying!? This is hardly the time for gleeful greetings or alliterative addresses, kupo!
10201: Even as we speak, overzealous Goblins are partaking not just in the Starlight Celebration spirit, but others' precious presents! These Gobbies bear no bad blood, but their covetous capers are the cause of much consternation, kupo.
10202: And to make matters worse, they've even filched the furnishings the MHMU ordered from the guilds... I know the saying, "If you give a Goblin goulash..." but this is just rikupulous!
10203: Please, <Player>, I beseech you! Find the Goblins traipsing about town and teach them the meaning of private property once and for all! (By affably asking them to relinquish what they requisitioned, kupo.)
10204: It may seem like the MHMU is just exploiting the nearest adventurer, but nay! You--and only you--are capable of restoring resplendence and revelry to the realm. Now go forth and fulfill the festive fate we thrust upon you, kupo!
10205: Kupopopo! Have you forgotten your merry mission already? Get giddy, gift-grabbing Goblins around town to give back people's goods, then go gab to a Moogle when you're done.
10206: And remember, Gobbies like to stick their noses in other creatures' business, if you know what I mean. Snuff out your smell so they can't sense your spoils, kupo.
10207: And remember, Goblins go cuckoo for comestibles, kupo. Offer them their favorite food, for they should forget you even exist.
10208: And remember, Goblins just want to jump for joy and jubilation at this jocular time of year. Bequeath beastmen bills or bedazzling bijoux to them and you may find yourself furnished with furnishings in return, kupo.
10209: Great glorious Goddess, you've managed to procure a present! Praise be to your positively prodigious persistence! ...And your altruistic attitude after you return it to its rightful remitter, kupo!
10210: It looks like this gift is from someone named %0. Seek out the sender and start spreading some Starlight spirit, kupo! Oh, and watch out for mischievous Goblin mitts, my little gofer--I mean adventurer!
10211: Wonderful work, warden of weal! However, since giving is greater than receiving, how about giving %0 word that you were able to deliver the present?
10212: The considerable amount of charity you've shown complete strangers cannot be overstated, kupo. Without your magnanimity, moxie, and master mediation skills, this year's Starlight Celebration would have been a much dimmer affair.
10213: Yet to polish this party to the point of pristine luster, more Goblins must be taught the difference between naughty and nice! Remember, once you give back a gift, seal the deal by simply sauntering over to the nearest moogle. We're counting on you, kupo!
10214: The MHMU humbly offers you this token of our thanks, not only for making the world a brighter place, but for tolerating our moogle mummery and the voluminous vats of verbosity that violated your virgin ears.
10215: Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear! I forgot those festive Gobbies are still frolicking with our furnishings, kupo!
10216: I'm so sorry to solicit further favors from you, but could you kindly retrieve those as well? Pretty please with paprika on top? You wouldn't want to keep us from rewarding the good boys and girls of Vana'diel, would you, kupo?
10217: Kupo ho ho! Do my deteriorating eyes deceive me, or is that one of the furnishings we ordered? We'd planned on giving them all to needy orphans, but you've done so much for the MHMU recently, why don't you have this one? 'Tis the season, so they say.
10218: What an astounding accomplishment, as expected of an adventurer like you! We are eternally grateful for the copious kindnesses you've conferred upon us, kupo.
10219: Word around the union fountain is that other nations' furnishings still remain at large. Would it be too terrible a torment to traipse around town--peepers peeled for gregarious Gobbies ogling purported presents--the next time you visit another nation? The MHMU would be forever in your debt, kupo.
10220: (Wheeew, way to whisk that one under the rug. I could never tell [him/her] that we got distracted by the dazzling decorations and had the furnishings nabbed from nigh under our noses!)
10221: Happy toy, happy toy, where be me happy toy?t
10222: Ev'ry girl, ev'ry boy, ev'rybody, happy toy! Me nose holes smell the joy, The joy from happy toy! Wheeere cooould iiit beee?t
10223: This for me? In-doo-bid-ably! Could be gooder, but it not bad.
10224: Waaah! It you! You give yum-yums for me tum-tum. Good [guy/girl]!
10225: Not for us, not for me? I give it back. Now you happy? Happy toy, happy toy, where be me happy toy?t
10226: No no no no no! Go away! Nose holes busy sniff for happy toy!
10227: ...
10228: You have friend, you do? We Gobbies have friend too.
10229: Yum-yums for me? Gobbies remember...till our tummies go rumble-rumble again.
10230: For me!? Why give so nice thing to me!? Me so happy head go boom! So boom! But first, me need give happy toy to you too.
10231: Happy toy? For me? Why you give so good thing to me? But no can take. Me have no happy toy for you.
10232: Blech. What this yucky thing? It make me want upgut food. Take it away.
10233: What? But how...? If that's truly from %0, that must mean...you stole it and you're ransoming it back to me! If you think for one moment that I'd pay scum like you, you'd best think twice!
10234: Oh, I see. My apologies. How silly of me. Everyone knows how mischievous Goblins get during the Starlight Celebration season. I read somewhere that it's got something to do with the moon and the tides or whatnot.
10235: Anyway, sorry to trouble you, but could you deliver this in my stead? I may look like a strapping young lad, but I have this illness that prevents me from doing the same task twice in one day. Quite troublesome, really.
10236: Also, could you do me a favor and report back to me after you're done? I didn't want to spend the extra gil for delivery confirmation with times as tough as they are, you know?
10237: I take it you delivered my present safe and sound? Oh, and it was well received, too? Ha, you didn't need to tell me that, for my gifts are always a hit. I guess I should thank you though, seeing as how you played a tiny part in my Starlight Celebration success.
10238: Waaah, a cutthroat! Take anything you want, just not my lucky chocobo hose, please! I... Wait, isn't that the gift I sent %0? You didn't steal that too, did you!?
10239: What!? You...valiantly wrested it from the clutches of a greedy Goblin so you could return it to me? I just knew my [handsome champion/fair handmaiden] in resplendent regalia would come some day!
10240: I'm sure you've been through quite a few trials and tribulations just getting this back to me, your fair lady. However, my hands are tied at the moment and I can't take this present to %0. Therefore, I command you, my loyal follower, to act as my liaison and deliver it unscathed. I have no doubt that you'll succeed, since a [knight/handmaiden] will do anything to serve and protect [his/her] mistress.
10241: And please don't forget to check in with me after the delivery is made. Every [champion/handmaiden] knows that's the [chivalrous/proper] thing to do.
10242: How fared your journey, my [courageous champion/humble handmaiden]? Oh, I simply knew I could place my complete trust in you! You've not only made your fair lady quite proud, but saved the Starlight Celebration from those covetous beastmen! Oh, joyous day!
10243: I beg your pardon, but I cannot help but notice that this is the parcel I sent to %0. How might you have come by it?
10244: Ah, I see. Those Goblin rapscallions still show a complete and utter disregard for social graces, would you not agree? At any rate, you seem to possess a rather strong sense of justice, and for that I am most grateful.
10245: Could you also find it within your heart to see that this package reaches %0 safely? I may be a man of humble means, but you will certainly have my eternal gratitude and undying admiration.
10246: Oh my. This utterly slipped my addled mind. I am truly sorry, but I fear I must heap one more request upon your already burdened back. Could you please report back to me after you've made the delivery? It would undoubtedly lessen the anxiety weighing down my fragile heart.
10247: Goddess be good, you have returned! And with favorable tidings, no? Splendid. Absolutely splendid. Thanks to you, I feel as if I could burst into a Starlight carol at any moment. Fa-la-la-la`t.
10248: What doth bring thee 'fore these rheumy eyes, orbs that pierce the soul and a stranger's guise? Harken, thou hast %0's present, from whom hast thou received such consent?
10249: 'Tis an entertaining tale with which thy jowls doth flail, A tale of Goblins run amok, and wretched me bereft of luck. Still, thanks are in store for completing this chore with a dearth of gore.
10250: While these next words may conjure a storm, I cannot assist thee in any form. Thus, I entreat thee to heed the call...deliver this gift to %0 once and for all!
10251: 'Fore I finish this lengthy tirade, one last request must be made. Once the gift hath changed hands, return at once for further plans.
10252: Thou hast safely returned from thy trial? Upon us both doth Altana smile! To thee, the savior of the Starlight Celebration, I do give heartfelt acclamations!
10253: Wh-wh-what have you got there? It looks awfully-wafully like the gift I gave to %0. Did something happen? P-p-please don't tell me that %0 passy-wassed away!
10254: ...It was just a G-g-goblin prank? Sorry to overreactaru. I had a t-t-traumatic experience last Starlight Devastation--er, Celebration! So now I always feary-wear the worst. By the way, th-th-thank you for getting my gift back.
10255: As you can guess, m-m-my comfort zone is rather itty-bitty. I know you must be expired--tired! But can you please helpy-welp me and deliver my present to %0?
10256: After you pass on--the gift! Pass the gift on! Then c-c-could you report back to me? I truly-wuly want to know how %0 reacts.
10257: Ah, you're back! It's %0's most perished, er, cherished possession, you say? Wh-wh-what lofty-wofty praise! I can't thank you enough for your c-c-contributions, adventurer.
10258: So many nasty-wasty things happened to me today, I'm just too moody-woody to listen to your blather! Begone before I--wait, isn't that my present to %0?
10259: Ugh, quit barking like a bog dog, [brother-wother/sister-wister]! I don't give a ham and cheese about giddy Goblins or lazy moogles.
10260: You think you're so great because you saved my present from some baddie-waddies? Bah humbug-wumbug! If you're gonna stick your nosey-wose in others' business, then you bettaru finish what you started! You'll be taking that gift on over to %0, I tell you what!
10261: And don't think for a minute-winute that I'm going to let you get away with ruining my day! Report back here for a tongue-lashing when you're done! Now get going before I gutaru you right here and now!
10262: Hmph, so you're stupid as well as rude? Are you so subservient that you'd actually come backy-wack for a beating? Get out of my face! You disgustaru me. Oh, and Merry Starlight!
10263: Hey, I sent that to %0. Why do you have it?
10264: Hmmm. Stolen by Gobbies, huh? Thanks for getting it back.
10265: Sorry to burden you, but could you bring it to %0 again for me?
10266: Also, I'd like it if you could please fill me in when you're done.
10267: I see you've returned. Mmm...that's good news indeed. Thank you for the kindness you've shown me and my friend.
10268: What have we here? A cat burrrglar? How dare you despoil the innocent people of our fair nation!
10269: What am I talking about? That's the prrresent I sent %0! How could you have it if you didn't steal it!?
10270: Oh, I see. You're a defender of justice too. Good job negotiating with those Goblin scum. I just hope that rrrepeating that story to everyone you've saved hasn't got you hacking up hairballs.
10271: But enough tail wagging. I have some prey I need to take care of, so could you rrredeliver that gift to %0 and report back to me when you're done?
10272: What timing! I've just rrreturned from my own mission. Whew, good thing %0 liked it! That little trinket was as high priced as the hair on a cat's back! Anyway, thanks for your help. If your fur ever gets rubbed the wrong way, give me a sign and I'll come rrroaring to the rescue!
10273: A present...from %0? Oh, glorious day! This is for all those times I never got a present and kept telling myself next year will be the one.
10274: I'm at a loss for what to say! I'm just overwhelmed with a waterfall of emotion! Thank you so much!
10275: And please thank %0 the next time you see that good samaritan. The person who said, "'Tis better to give than receive" probably never had a gift drought as long as mine. I feel fantastic!
10276: Oh, is that...a present? From %0, you say?
10277: Ugh, it figures. Did it come with a card that says something pathetic like "I've died a thousand deaths drowning in the depths of your eyes"? That scoundrel has been stalking me ever since we happened to meet one day on a boat to Buburimu Peninsula.
10278: I'm actually quite fed up with these ridiculous baubles, but I'm not one for losing face. If you should see %0 again, please give my regards and say I found the gift rather...quaint.
10279: What's this? A present addressed to me from %0?
10280: How unexpectedly charming and thoughtful. This has certainly brightened what was about to be a gloomy Starlight Celebration.
10281: Would you be so kind as to tell %0 that I truly appreciate the gift? I am also thoroughly impressed with your selfless nature, adventurer.
10282: Could it be...? Indeed, it is benevolence manifest, emanating from the humble home of one %0?
10283: What a decidedly pleasant surprise. I am simply beside myself with an unbridled, childish glee that has not washed over me in ever so long. I swear that I am on the brink of giggling like I used to when I was still knee-high to a Taru.
10284: The finite words of us mere mortals may not be sufficient to convey the depths of my gratitude, but I earnestly hope %0 would appreciate a succinct "Thank you."
10285: A present from...%0? This isn't one of those tricky-wicky flimflams, is it?
10286: Of course I'll take it! I'm not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, even if it's from my mortaru enemy! Maybe %0 has turned over a new leaf since we last met...
10287: Well then, I suppose some thanks are in order. But if I find out that this was just some elaborataru scheme to make me lower my guard, I'm going to boppy-wop you both in the noggin!
10288: Oooh, a gift from %0? What jolly-wolly tidings you've brought, adventurer.
10289: I wonder what's inside... Could it be a scrum-diddly-umptious cake? But I've already gotten so roly-poly during the holiday season! Maybe I should just send it back!
10290: No, thataru wouldn't be right. Besides, it might not be edible. Anyway, please be sure to thank %0 for pudding the icing on such a delectable Starcake Chocolation. Ugh, I'm just terrible!
10291: Why would %0 be sending me a gift? It's not like there's anything special going on.
10292: The Starlight Celebration, you say? So that explains the light shows and festive atmosphere around here lately. My head just hasn't been the same since I fell off that chocobo last month.
10293: I best start looking for something to give in return. In the meantime, please tell %0 how happy I am to have received this. And maybe next year I'll remember before it's too late. <Sigh>...One can only hope.
10294: A present for me? I'm a lone lioness, and I don't need to share my kills with anyone!
10295: What? %0 wanted me to have this? Well, I guess I could take it...
10296: Don't get the wrrrong idea! It's not like I enjoy the gift or anything! Just run back to %0 and drop dead! This conversation never happened!
10297: You have received $6!
10298: Your $3 has been taken!
10299: You handed over $6.
10300: Welcome to the MHMU's porter service, kupo! Which of your burdensome belongings shall I take off your hands today?
10301: Do something, kupo? [Porter service?/Buy a storage slip./No, thank you.]
10302: Is your gobbiebag splitting at the seams? Mog Safe spilling over? Why, an accomplished adventurer like yourself surely has more stuff than you know what to do with.
10303: That's where I come in, kupo. I'll gladly hold onto your prized possessions, freeing you space to gather up even grander goodies.
10304: To make use of my services, first you'll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of $19 gil.
10305: Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.
10306: You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.
10307: Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.
10308: Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip. I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.
10309: Invisible to you, at least. It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.
10310: When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.
10311: I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw. Simple as that, kupo!
10312: What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred! Pretty generous of us for a change, no?
10313: Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo. So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!
10314: For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.
10315: Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect! It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.
10316: Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.
10317: If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts! No "I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again!" Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.
10318: Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.
10319: If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.
10320: And that's all there is to it. This humble moogle can hardly wait to serve you!
10321: Buy something? (p. $16/$17). [Previous page./$0./$1./$2./$3./$4./$5./$6./$7./$8./$9./$10./$11./$12./$13./$14./$15./Next page./Cancel.]
10322: $32 will cost you $19 gil. Do we have a deal, kupo?
10323: Deal, kupo? (Current gil: $18). [Check storable items./Deal./No deal.]
10324: The $32 will allow you to store the following items:
10325: $33.
10326: $33.
10327: ...and that's all.
10328: $32 (p. $16/$17). [Previous page./$0./$1./$2./$3./$4./$5./$6./$7./$8./$9./$10./$11./$12./$13./$14./$15./Next page./Cancel.]
10329: Warning! If you lose your $0 while storing a corresponding item, you will be forever unable to retrieve that item!
10330: Is that $3 I see, kupo?
10331: What will you do? [Retrieve an item./Confirm storable items./Nothing.]

10333: Retrieve $32? [Retrieve it./Leave it.]
10334: You retrieve $0 from the porter moogle's care.
10335: Kupo? I'm already taking care of that item for you.
10336: $0, yes? Very well! Your precious property is safe with me, kupo!
10337: $0 [variety/varieties] of item, is it? Very well! Your precious property is safe with me, kupo!
10338: Is that a Magian insignia I see on that $0? You'll have to abandon your trial before I can take it off your hands, kupo.
10339: That $0 appears to be augmented. I'm sorry, but I can't accept such specialized gear, kupo.
10340: Curious as to whether I can accept that item? Let me check my annals.
10341: Why, yes I can! % can be stored with $1.
10342: Why, it looks as if you have $1 located in your [inventory/Mog Safe/Mog Safe 2/Mog House storage/Mog Locker/Mog Satchel/Mog Sack/Mog Case/Mog Wardrobe/Mog Wardrobe 2/Mog Wardrobe 3/Mog Wardrobe 4/Mog Wardrobe 5/Mog Wardrobe 6/Mog Wardrobe 7/Mog Wardrobe 8/Recycle Bin]!

10358: You can trade in these tokens for our gratuitous gifts any time during this campaign!

10368: Wait one short second while I get your goods!
10369: Something went wrong, kupo! Try again later.
10370: Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Rolandienne in Southern San d'Oria (G-10).
10371: Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Isakoth in Bastok Markets (E-11).
10372: Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Fhelm Jobeizat in Windurst Woods (J-10).
10373: Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Eternal Flame in Western Adoulin (H-11).
10374: Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Nantoto in Lower Jeuno (H-8).
10375: Invisible eyes upon you cause the hairs on the back of your neck to rise.
10376: The $3 nods in agreement.
10377: A new Records of Eminence objective is now available!
10378: A new Records of Eminence objective, "$0," is now available!
10379: You wish to exchange your sparks?
10380: Wait but a moment. Here, follow this command--er, compendium to the letter and you should be able to learn a thing or two.
10381: Ah, this almost slipped my mind. Should you receive any distinct sorts of artifacts for completing an objective, I will be happy to take them off your hands.
10382: Worry not, for I am not out to rob you of your glory. Quite the opposite, in fact. I will provide you with a worthwhile reward for collecting them.
10383: Thanks to your donation, I now have $1 $0 in safekeeping.
10384: Ohohoho... Turning in sparks, I see.
10385: Hold your hoarder hares, [hero/heroine]. I love your enthusiasm, but you're not going to learn a thing without a primer. Ahhh, here it is. Have a look-see.
10386: Oh, crud, that's right. You should trade me any special artifacts you get from completing objectives.
10387: "Why?" What a good question! Because I'll give you a nifty-difty reward at some point, that's why.
10388: Thanks for doing what I asked. Now I have a total of $1 $0 from you.
10389: You want to trrrade in sparks, do you?
10390: Let me wake up from my catnap first... Alright, now rrread this.
10391: Wait, wait, wait! If you happen to get any purrrticularly interesting items from completing objectives, send them my way.
10392: Don't worry, I'm as honest as a cat when the meat's out of reach. I thought of taking them all for myself...
10393: ...but I don't want to make fur fly with the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network, so I'll do my job like a good little kitty.
10394: Grrreat! Now I have $1 $0 from you. Thanks!
10395: Hm? Oh, spark exchange... Of course.
10396: I'm not completely sure, but this might help set some things straight...I guess.
10397: Let me add one thing. Please find it within your heart of hearts to give me anything of particular interest you get from completing objectives.

10478: Those impudent fools from that Jeunoan institute. After their years of research, I'd thought them more astute.
10479: To let that rogue Ajido-Marujido in on the game, While I sit here dethroned, maligned, and shamed!
10480: If an adventurer possessing $6 passed through my domain, It would give me no greater pleasure than to make them writhe in pain.
10481: Well, well, I see that <Player> has come to visit me. This is no pleasant surprise. My heart is filled with rage, not glee.
10482: Yes, since you're here, I'll share with you my brilliance: I've a task here which will test your resilience.
10483: Together we are to undertake the ritual known as "Extreme Trust." If the ceremony fails, you are less than a blade covered in rust.
10484: Attempt the ritual? [Yes./No./"Extreme" Trust?]
10485: However calm of temperament and poised I seem to be, step out of line and I'll have adventurer fricassee.
10486: If I were in your shoes, I wouldn't worry about the details. Just keep your eye on the prize, and your train of thought on the right trail. Ohohohohohoho!
10487: Now that's the response one of my stature likes to hear. With someone as grand as me to guide you, there's surely naught to fear.
10488: However, let me first provide you with several words of warning. If this fails, it's on your head--and you won't live to see the morning.
10489: Attempt the ritual anyway? [Y-yes...?/I'm out.]
10490: This quaking and quavering of yours is not attractive whatsoever.
10491: Fear not, for there is a method behind the madness of this endeavor.
10492: Surely you remember when others used my resplendent name for despicable acts. And yet, people laid the blame at my feet, ignoring all the facts.
10493: As an aside, one of my journeys of late took me to [//yet ]another world. Though far be it from me to mention what calamities may have occurred.
10494: There I discovered something wonderful--a vast sum of advanced erudition. The five ministries could work for millennia and still be no competition.
10495: The world that we know is far more expansive than we thought. All our treks, travels, and tomes--have our experiences been for naught?
10496: Though the distance at first seems uncrossable, When the universe is your oyster, nothing is impossible.
10497: Do you get what I am trying to say? We can cross whole dimensions--not in centuries, but today.
10498: Do you understand? [P-probably.../What're you on about?]
10499: The panicked look in your eyes tells me all I need to know. To look smarter than you are, you decided to go with the flow.
10500: You know the old saying, "appearances can be deceiving"? In your case, it's false, for your denseness is so obvious it's grieving.
10501: To be frank, it matters little whether or not you understand. If separate worlds are connected, then so is the common man.
10502: And what's more, this does not stop at Galka, Mithra, or Hume. All life is intertwined, like threads of wool on a loom.
10503: When I took the time to consider further, it gave me pause. Could I not utilize this knowledge to further my own cause?
10504: For example, what if someone were to threaten my place in history? I could extract their mortal fears and make them writhe in misery.
10505: But while I was pondering this fantastic piece of news, The fools in Jeuno announced something similar, so I lose!
10506: Their methods are different: trust, friendship, and love. But the theory's the same--and it fits like a glove.
10507: Can you believe it? They stole the topic of my next dissertation! I've half a mind to make them the target of my next conflagration.
10508: Imagine the nerve of those involved in the project! It was a major affront and a sign of total disrespect.
10509: Those want-to-be wizards denied me my prize, When, in the grand scheme of things, they're disease-ridden flies.
10510: They refused to provide me with the fruits of my labor. I swear they will suffer--and I'm not rattling my saber!
10511: When all this is over, I will have been more than just cruel. Their leader shall cower before me! I pity the fool!
10512: Yet even that I am willing to overlook. For I shall have my way, by hook or by crook.
10513: So instead, I have chosen to develop the magic myself. Come, stand beside me. Leave your reservations on the shelf.
10514: Yes, <Player>, my first subject shall be you. There are many more worthy, but I suppose you will do.
10515: I command you to take a deep breath and close your eyes. Whether you will survive the process, I can only surmise.
10516: Ohoho...hmm?
10517: Well, <Player>, now you've really got egg on your face. This can't be my fault, so it's you who's misplaced.
10518: There is but one thing you can do, and it comes as no surprise. Let the cold darkness take you, and face your own demise!
10519: Ohohoho! I might be the harshest mistress in all of Vana'diel, But I may yet forgive you, if at my feet you kneel.
10520: I couldn't be more magnanimous, considering what you've done. After all, the way you nearly killed that Taru left you under the gun.
10521: What's this, then? You dare claim I was the mastermind? That brazen arrogance of yours is wholly unrefined.
10522: Your accusations are irrelevant, your mind shrouded with fog. So let me continue--this is my monologue.
10523: Still, the way you vanquished the Shadow Lord left me impressed. You didn't give in to terror, you refused to acquiesce.
10524: You won the thanks of the nation for saving the Star Sibyl. For once, I shall admit to your prowess sans quibble.
10525: In fact, if I deigned to assign you a grade, It would be an A+, for you came up in spades.
10526: [I think back on/I also remember] when you brought back that fool, Prishe. I'd wager that girl cannot fathom the horrors she unleashed.
10527: I can still hear Yoran-Oran wailing in despair. "I swear, Dr. Shantotto, there's no illegitimate heir-ethy!"
10528: But looking back now, it was a good deal of fun. So I shall forgive you. All people get one.
10529: [If I remember correctly/Next, of course], there was that incident with Ragnarok. When it came to shedding blood, you certainly did not balk.
10530: Oh? You say the second coming failed to ring true? That's not the point. I'm sure you did all you could do.
10531: As for me, I reveled in outrageous military spending. It was all quite fun... <Cough> I mean, I'm still lamenting!
10532: [That/And that] stunt you pulled at the chocobo races! Oh, how I wanted to make you one of my test cases!
10533: And trust me, ungrateful <Player>, you weren't the only one. I should have made sure that Markovich nevermore saw the sun!
10534: [I cannot forget your impudence when you decided to/Not one to rest on your laurels, you also had the gall to] challenge me to combat, thinking you could win. I hope you enjoyed my dear puppet twin.
10535: But I'd like to think you learned something from my little lesson. Since you were a good pupil, I'll overlook your transgression.
10536: To his credit, Koru-Moru told me to attack with that doll. But on further introspection, I should have set it to "maul."
10537: [And yet, here you stand, and/Yet despite all your efforts,] the ritual has failed. Could it be, perhaps, that you got scared and bailed?
10538: Remember that time with Yoran-Oran and Koru-Moru? Oh, weren't we just the best of friends, through and through?
10539: I gave you that hat, though it was covered in grime. So if you want to repay the favor, now is the time!
10540: It gives me great pleasure to say, that to my will you shall bend. So come to my cold embrace, and meet your untimely end!
10541: Ohoho......ho?
10542: They say when faced with death, people bite back like cats in a cage. I thought it was an old wives' tale--but whoever came up with it was a sage!
10543: You kept your eyes on the prize, dared as boldly as Nanaa Mihgo, And so you are rewarded. Now you can summon my alter ego.
10544: More importantly, my instinct about this magic was on the mark. And those stuffies would deny me my right--what a lark!
10545: I wonder, though, if there aren't more secrets to uncover. Just think, <Player>, of all we've left to discover!
10546: But that task I will not commit myself to at the present. So if you find something, hurry back, lest I make you repent.
10547: What are you still doing here? Get out of my face! Dirty adventurers like yourself should know their place!
10548: After you turn around and walk out that door, I'll wake up Hiwon-Biwon. Who can stand how he snores?
10549: That spell I cast on him is more dangerous than it seems. It could even cause his death, if taken to extremes!
10550: Ohohohohoho!
10551: Zzz... zzz... <Mmph>...
10552: <Snore>... No, Shantotto...not...not the whip... Zzz...
10553: The mandragora flutters about in consternation.
10554: The mandragora surreptitiously hands you something.
10555: Babban Ny Mheillea looks fondly in your direction.
10556: Babban Ny Mheillea surreptitiously hands you something.
10557: Nice to meet you, my [kinda/really] tall friend! I'm Babban Ny Mheillea!
10558: Oh, <Player>! I'm so glad to see you!
10559: You must be really special to be able to change forms like that! But I could tell who you were right away!
10560: My friends and I are playing a fun game called "sunshine seeker," where we search for shards of sunlight!
10561: Just give them a little squeeze and you'll see how warm and bright they are!
10562: But my friends're so much better than I am...
10563: Maybe you could lend me a hand! Yours're much bigger than mine!
10564: Lend Babban a hand? [I'll lend you two!/I'm a bit busy right now.]
10565: Aww... Hopefully you'll change your mind. I'll be waiting here!
10566: Hooray! Maybe I'll finally be able to win!
10567: I'll give you some small seeds in exchange for the shards of sunlight you bring back.
10568: Even better! I've got some special things available for you to buy with your seeds!
10569: But here's the best part--If you try your luck with my grab bag enough times, you might win something really super!
10570: One of the rules of the game is that you must be a mandragora, like me, or else you won't be able to collect any shards.
10571: They can be found all around here. But if you don't hurry, someone else might gobble them up.
10572: But once you've taken them from one place, you can't get any more from there by searching it repeatedly!
10573: Shards of sunlight are really delicate, so they'll disappear if you leave this area or take too much time getting them back to me.
10574: My friends'll also try to get in your way, so be sure not to get noticed!
10575: I can fly you right to the starting point. Just say the word!
10576: Ready for mischief? [The sun will bow before me!/The light...it burns us!]
10577: Nononono, sunlight is your friend! Come back once you've decided to help me hunt!
10578: Good luck! Collect as many as you can and bring them back to me!
10579: Why, hello!
10580: Inquire about what? [I want to play the game./I'm ready to turn in my shards./I want to exchange small seeds./Let me try the grab bag./How many seeds do I have?/I'd like the items you're holding for me./Dispose of what you're holding for me./Tell me how the game works./No questions for now.]
10581: You look like you'll be able to try for even harder things in this game!
10582: My friends'll try to get in your way even more. Are you sure you're ready?
10583: Wow! I'll bet you're ready for the championship round!
10584: My friends'll surely never let you get away now! Sure you want to try anyway?
10585: Oh no...you mean you didn't find even one single shard? That's terrible...
10586: I'll be waiting for you to play our game again!
10587: You did such a lovely job! You brought me $0 shard[/s] of sunlight, so I'll give you $1 small seed[/s]!
10588: I can give you so many pretty gifts in exchange for your small seeds!
10589: Which would you like?
10590: Which would you like? ($30 seed[/s]). [#: $11 seed[/s]./$1: $12 seed[/s]./$2: $13 seed[/s]./$3: $14 seed[/s]./$4: $15 seed[/s]./$5: $16 seed[/s]./$6: $17 seed[/s]./$7: $18 seed[/s]./$8: $19 seed[/s]./$9: $20 seed[/s]./$10: $21 seed[/s]./None of these.]
10591: Are you sure? [Yes./No.]
10592: I've prepared a little grab bag you can enjoy for some small seeds.
10593: Which would you like to try?
10594: Pick your poison. ($30 seed[/s]) [The $0-seed grab bag./The $1-seed grab bag./The $2-seed grab bag./No poison, thanks.]
10595: That grab bag contains prizes like $0, $1, and $2.
10596: Press your luck? [C'mon, no whammies.../Not right now.]
10597: You won $0! Congratulations!
10598: ...But your bags are full! What do you want me to do with it?
10599: What will you do with the $0? [Have Babban hold it./I don't want it.]
10600: I'll make sure to keep it really safe! Come back when you've made room!
10601: Then...you won't mind if I have it!
10602: You have a total of $0 small seed[/s].
10603: The goal of sunshine seeker is to collect shards of sunlight!
10604: You don't have enough small seeds.
10605: You are now participating in sunshine seeker! Get your hands on as many shards of sunlight in the allotted time as you can!
10606: $0 [minute/second][/s] remaining.
10607: You receive $0 shard[/s] of sunlight for a total of $1!
10608: Oh no! [Abenzio/Bryher/Camlin/Darach/Babban's Progeny] has found you!
10609: [Abenzio/Bryher/Camlin/Darach/Babban's Progeny] gives you a little slap!
10610: You grow dizzy and lose $0 second[/s] of searching time!
10611: You feel a bit weak in the knees!
10612: You feel a bit confused. Has someone taken... Hey! Where'd your shards go!? You only have $1 left!
10613: What was that strange solar phenomenon? The number of shards of sunlight has increased, but Babban's friends are also moving faster than normal!
10614: The sun returns to normal. There are fewer shards of sunlight available, but Babban's friends are also moving slower.
10615: Time's up! Your quest for sunlight has ended in failure.
10616: You've left the area, causing your quest for sunlight to end in failure.
10617: You've failed to acquire any shards of sunlight. Your quest ends in failure.
10618: It might be in your best interests to speak to [Urbiolaine/Igsli/Teldro-Kesdrodo/Nunaarl Bthtrogg] in $8 [(G-10)/(E-11)/(J-10)/(H-11)].
10619: Join which Unity? [I need time to consider./Pieuje./Ayame./Invincible Shield./Apururu./Maat./Aldo./Jakoh Wahcondalo./Naja Salaheem./Flaviria./Yoran-Oran./Sylvie.]

10641: Unity Concord is a system promulgated and managed by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network.
10642: Participating adventurers are able to receive a variety of benefits and rewards just by engaging in their everyday activities.
10643: "Unity" is a catchall term that refers to the group that participants belong to.
10644: Unity leaders are individuals who have strong ties to adventurers' activities and are sterling representatives of their home nations.
10645: Members of the same Unity can converse with each other over great distances through the use of specialized figurines known as "$5."
10646: Chat settings may be changed by selecting "Status" from the main menu, and choosing "Unity Info" under the "Unity" submenu.
10647: You may not always be able to join the chat if too many players are participating at once.
10648: Those belonging to a Unity are able to undertake special Records of Eminence objectives related to Unity Concord activities.
10649: The three pertinent categories include shared objectives, Unity leader-specific objectives, and Wanted battle objectives.
10650: Shared objectives may be taken regardless of which Unity you have joined. These tasks can be undertaken at any time, and change every day at midnight (JST).
10651: Unity leader-specific objectives are tied to the Unity's eponymous leader and change each week.
10652: "Wanted" objectives center around vanquishing particularly heinous foes that terrorize Vana'diel.
10653: These objectives are of a higher caliber, and thus require currency known as "Unity accolades" to undertake.
10654: Shared and leader-specific objectives provide more accolades than run-of-the-mill objectives.
10655: Vana'diel has always been plagued by nefarious foes pillaging the landscape, but relatives of some of the more heinous ones have been spotted lately.
10656: The A.M.A.N. has deemed it necessary to eliminate these Wanted targets, and has notified Unity members that they are of the utmost priority.
10657: A list of these foes can be viewed at any time by selecting the appropriate subcategory under the objectives list.
10658: Unity Concord representatives are able to provide participants with transportation to the areas where these threats can be found.
10659: Though tackling the profane will likely require participation of your allies, the objective can be undertaken so long as at least one person has set the appropriate objective.
10660: When you set the objective and commence the battle, the requisite number of Unity accolades will be deducted from your total.
10661: Successful challengers will be rewarded with special rewards in addition to the normal sparks of eminence.
10662: No Unity accolades will be charged should you commence the battle without having the appropriate objective set, but the rewards you can reap from your efforts will be limited.
10663: You can snatch unparalleled equipment and materials from the slain corpses of Wanted targets.
10664: An A.M.A.N. specialist versed in arcane harmonization has kindly offered to use these materials to bring out the latent potential in such pieces.
10665: One of the Unity guides will be pleased to accept certain combinations of equipment and materials to begin the process for you.
10666: A number of accolades is required for this service, but the precision and accuracy of her methods are without equal, and there is no worry of your equipment being destroyed.
10667: You can use specified materials to add new attributes to equipment that has been upgraded.
10668: Utilizing additional materials after adding an attribute can accumulate Reinforcement Points for the equipment and increase its rank.
10669: Increasing your equipment's rank can boost its attributes, while some equipment can also have additional attributes added later.
10670: Speak to the Unity guides after gathering the necessary materials for your equipment in order to add attributes to it or increase its rank.
10671: The first time you add an attribute to a piece of equipment will require the use of Unity accolades.
10672: It also requires that you first complete a specific Records of Eminence objective.
10673: The work you request will be carried out on-site by a specially trained Unity guide.
10674: Completing Records of Eminence objectives as part of a Unity will reward you with Unity accolades in addition to sparks of eminence.
10675: These accolades not only serve as a symbol of prestige, but can also be exchanged for a variety of services.
10676: Some of these services include purchasing items, securing battle zones for hunting Wanted targets, fees for strengthening equipment, and more.
10677: Please note that you may only exchange a maximum of $0 accolades per week (Earth time).
10678: You may switch Unities once during the Unity ranking tabulation period.
10679: This is not a decision to be taken lightly, for switching Unities will cause you to forfeit any benefits you were receiving from your previous one.
10680: This process requires a fair deal of paperwork, and the A.M.A.N. will charge you an accolade fee based on your rank.
10681: However, your valorous deeds remain wherever you choose to go, and you will not lose any other accolades.
10682: Rankings are decided through the combined efforts of each of the Unity's members.
10683: The A.M.A.N. tabulates all the good deeds done during a period of time and confers benefits on a Unity for the following ranking period.
10684: Some of these benefits include changes to Unity accolades gained and the effects of equipment earned from Wanted battles.
10685: Yes, you read that correctly--the attributes of certain equipment will increase in line with your Unity's ranking.
10686: On the other hand, members of a Unity that finds itself on the lower rungs will enjoy an increase in accolades and capacity points earned to help bring them up to par.
10687: Additionally, an individual's evaluation is the sum of the accolades they have earned divided by $0. A Unity's ranking is the average of all eligible members' individual evaluations.
10688: The A.M.A.N. does not look kindly on those who only seek to siphon rewards from others' hard work, and thus only confers these boons on those who have collected at least a certain number of accolades.
10689: Unity leaders may also join you as alter egos for a limited period of time.
10690: Those with evaluations of $0 or greater will be able to call forth an alter ego of their leader to assist them in battle.
10691: Those eligible will be able to use the alter ego from the moment they acquire the appropriate ranking level until the tabulation after the next.
10692: A leader's alter ego grows in power the higher their Unity is ranked.
10693: Changing Unities will remove the player's ability to call forth their leader's alter ego at the moment they leave their current Unity, regardless of personal evaluation or remaining time.
10694: A player will have to work hard in their new Unity and acquire a sufficient evaluation to regain the ability to call forth their new Unity's leader.
10695: It goes without saying that players must first have acquired a Trust permit in order to avail themselves of this opportunity.
10696: Those desiring to participate should seek out one of the initiative's representatives, dressed in green, in one of the three nations.
10697: You are currently under Unity restriction. Please try again during the next tabulation period.
10698: The A.M.A.N. has removed the Unity restrictions placed on you. Please choose your Unity.
10699: You call out for aid from the Unity leaders, but none have heeded your call. Please try again.
10700: You have already changed Unities. Please wait until the next tabulation period.
10701: Should you choose to be teleported to this area, you will not have enough accolades to participate in the Wanted battle. Teleport anyway?
10702: Teleport anyway? [Yes, please./No, thank you.]
10703: The crystal resonates deep within your soul!
10704: Vana'diel...in the year 898?
10705: I must make haste for Reisenjima and find the master before...
10706: Master, look at the orb.
10707: You have set us on the proper course and passed through the first of many gates to come.
10708: This precious jewel is one of Reisenjima Sanctorium's most mystical treasures.
10709: Our legends state that it was formed from the energies of a thousand different lives.
10710: Though it had originally been regarded as but a minor artifact, in the future you and my father had drawn forth its true power.
10711: In reality, it is a piece of the mothercrystal.
10712: Please, Master. You may have taken the first steps, but I urge you to continue pressing on.
10713: Gilgamesh awaits word in Norg.
10714: Master, behold your orb.
10715: Your path remains steadfast, and you have successfully reached the third gate.
10716: But the spirits which protect Reisenjima Sanctorium have gone silent...
10717: And I am unable to remain here in 884.
10718: My abject failure to guide you in your hour of need is a shame that I shall not overcome.
10719: Had I been able to better serve you, then maybe...
10720: But I can safely place my trust in you. You have come this far, and the orb grows stronger with each passing day. You will be ready when the world has reached the fulcrum.
10721: May your steps remain swift and true.
10722: Head for...the palace...
10723: Master, behold your orb.
10724: Your path remains steadfast, and you have successfully surpassed the third gate.
10725: But there remains one whom you have yet to meet. A young woman who plays a vital role in your story.
10726: I am afraid that you will not be able to see her in the world's current state.
10727: If only I could return to 884 and walk by your side once more!
10728: Yet my mind and body are crippled, and I can scarce muster this small advice--!
10729: Master...forgive me.
10730: Lead Aht Urhgan out of the darkness and forge the bonds you were destined to.
10731: I'm so hungry...
10732: Ovjang...Ovjang, where are you?
10733: I'm here...[in Aydeewa Subterrane/on a pirate ship]...
10734: Luzaf...I wish you were here...
10735: Please...help me...
10736: Razfahd must be stopped...
10737: Despite betrayal by those I once called my own...
10738: I refuse to yield until humanity's blight is purged from this land.
10739: I now serve to bring darkness unending, an umbral shroud choking the life from Vana'diel.
10740: Simply opening the Gate of the Gods would bring the Zilart what they have been denied for over ten thousand years.
10741: The endless nightmare would be endless no longer.
10742: Have you ever paused to consider exactly whose nightmare it is?
10743: Those who have ceased to be? Those who walk Vana'diel as she stands today?
10744: Old gods? New?
10745: No. It is a nightmare of the crystals themselves.
10746: We were born in Vana'diel and exist only due to her endless bounty.
10747: And yet our very presence here is an affront to her. We are the source of her nightmare.
10748: There is one secret to humanity's success: ambition. Imagining a better future, it strives ever onward in search of it.
10749: Having seen the promised land, it rages and struggles each day to become more than it was meant to be.
10750: And it continues to claw its way forward, even if what it aspires to be does not truly exist.
10751: Its insatiable avarice defines it more than even it can possibly realize.
10752: But I am not a "human" such as you. I will be--I must be--an existence far beyond the most grandiose thought of such petty, grasping beings.
10753: For that is what life is. And those who cannot reach that pinnacle are fated to perish.
10754: Time is a cruel beast whose savageness cannot be sated.
10755: Every man, woman, and child feels its claws sinking into their backs, the talons digging ever deeper with each passing day.
10756: It marches on, unstoppable, immaterial, and unforgiving, and all any of us can do is watch it pass.
10757: I claimed ever greater power in pursuit of my goals until my time, too, ran out.
10758: All I wanted to do was protect my countrymen...my homeland...
10759: An alternate world, with alternate fates and alternate existences.
10760: I gambled my own life away to protect the world I called home.
10761: Can you truly say that you [did/would have done] any different?
10762: I channeled my love for my homeland into power.
10763: When I fell before you...
10764: ...did it mean everything was for naught?
10765: I, and I alone, have seen the true nature of things in this world.
10766: And thus, I have learned why all beings that rise must fall.
10767: This is a burden which I must bear and prevent from happening ever again.
10768: Should you not understand why my goal is pure and just, then you are unworthy of being called human.
10769: Open your eyes and witness the truth!
10770: Don't let ignorance cloud your judgment!
10771: <Player>...
10772: What you see before you--is it a dream, or something else?
10773: Is this a dream? [What else could it be?/No. It's something more...]
10774: Come. Surely your vision cannot be that clouded.
10775: A keen eye, as always.
10776: The minds of all who have existed--and all who will exist--are as one.
10777: As, too, are the light and darkness inherent in the mothercrystals.
10778: I need not point out that the apparitions appearing before you are those whose schemes you have foiled.
10779: And those...
10780: ...Who you are destined to stop.
10781: I have sought them out of my own volition, hoping to manipulate their essences for my own ends.
10782: Dark, infernal forces, serving as a counterbalance to the light you hope to make manifest.
10783: And now is the time for me to fill you with that energy. Come.
10784: You don't really expect to save the world, do you?
10785: At best you might buy it a few more phases of the moon.
10786: Even should I fall, there is a grand legion aching to take my place.
10787: So in the end, all my journeys have been utterly without meaning.
10788: One by one, those I have trusted have fallen. None are left to prop me up when I begin to falter.
10789: Hahaha...none know who I rrreally am.
10790: False prophets. False worlds. False adventurers... The truth is the pain I feel inside.
10791: Each combat has prepared me for the next...but in the end, it's all worthless. A new age is descending, and it threatens to leave me behind.
10792: Pandora's box-wox has been opened, overturned, and shaken until nothing remains inside.
10793: Perhaps not even your precious-wecious "hope."
10794: Some claim that hope is what keeps humanity sane in these trying times...yet in reality it is a prison that shuts away the real world.
10795: No matter how deeply darkness has penetrated your soul...
10796: ...no matter how much you want to give up...
10797: You must not. You cannot.
10798: Hope is something seized, not given.
10799: Whether surrounded by friends or walking a hard road alone...
10800: There is unshaking value in seeing your path to its conclusion.
10801: You are the culmination of all your experiences.
10802: Even those who are gone still depend on you.
10803: <Player>, this rhapsody is yours to sing.

10807: Master--the orb.
10808: You have set history on its proper course yet again, having passed through the fourth gate that stood before you.
10809: Yet Selh'teus's words ring true--the darkness slumbering within you is great.
10810: He claims that not even the crystal is enough to illuminate it.
10811: I must confess my trepidation at the current state of affairs. What if the darkness overcomes you not in the future, but even earlier than I had anticipated?
10812: What a morbid state of affairs we find ourselves in.
10813: We must take solace in the hope that the orb will guide you to safety, so that you will be prepared for the Reckoning.
10814: Until that time, your footsteps must remain unerring.
10815: And so fate guides you to Ceizak Battlegrounds...
10816: The future should have changed...
10817: ...And I should have been dissolved into nothingness.
10818: Yet the crystal's clarion song has ceased.
10819: And the Cloud of Darkness threatens the world once more.
10820: Ah, another adventurer come to invade my domain. Please stand over there and stop playing dumb games.
10821: For your sake, I hope you aren't such a bore. I'm getting quite tired of cleaning blood off the floor.
10822: You have a girl from the future that has come to the past? I've seen this play out before--trust me, it won't last.
10823: Please, I beg-ethy you to calm down!
10824: Ah, Doctor Shantotto. Your laboratory smells quite lovely.
10825: Why, that would be the splendoreeno aroma from this jar!
10826: It's been fourteen years since I've combined a splendid-widdly-wendid blend of herbs and spices, all sealed tight in this jar until right now, when--
10827: Hush hush!!! The recipe is supposed to be a secret-ethy!
10828: The two of you can sit here and argue for hours, But there are those in duress who have need of our powers.
10829: Though your orb is quite fascinating and has me perplexed, And your friend from the East I would love to dissect...
10830: There are more pressing matters to which we must attend-- The issue of Selh'teus, to whose will the crystal shall bend.
10831: This world of yours--Tartarus?--it has me intrigued. "Please, Shantotto, help us!" I can hear you plead.
10832: Now wait just a minute. Why haven't I heard-ethy of this "Tartarus"?
10833: Dear Yoran-Oran, of course I know of this world. They want to know more, with details unfurled.
10834: H-how do you know of it?
10835: Vana'diel is in but one of countless dimensions. Though blessed by Altana, I must dutifully mention.
10836: Up until now I couldn't prove its existence, But help them I shall, if they need my assistance.
10837: The name by itself is a cause for alarm, And doubtless there are monsters who wish to cause harm.
10838: Diddly-doo, the universe is such a big place!
10839: Koru-Moru, you act as if you're wholly disconnected, But how soon you forget that monstrosity you've erected.
10840: You're always involved in some monkey business, And to a more sorry sight I've never borne witness.
10841: What did you do this time?
10842: I made a won-diddly-onderful contraption...or so I had thought. Turned into one of my biggest mistakes in recent memory.
10843: The world is full of all mannerareeno of terrible creatures, and I weep for a land that never knows peace.
10844: You know what I mean--you're an adventureeno!
10845: But the forces of light and dark must always be in balance, and one never wins out for very long.
10846: So if some diddly-darkness appears somewhere...
10847: Then there must be some way to seekareeno it out.
10848: And you want to use that thing-ethy of yours to find the evil they're on the lookout for?
10849: Just think-diddly-ink about it! What hero wouldn't want to get their hands on something that could seek out evil before it strikes?
10850: ...Though I had intended to use it to root out cheating studentareenos...
10851: But it did the strange-diddly-angest thing when I brought it to life. It pointed in a really weird direction.
10852: And so when he brought it to me with a look of concern, I found what you call Tartarus, and much did I learn.
10853: Thus I present to you without further ado, His deranged contraption, with purpose anew.
10854: The very thought of this is enough to give pause, But I think it can help you, with all of its flaws.
10855: I agree-ethy. If it points to large upswells of magic-ethy, that might help you find where the energy of the crystals is being drained to.
10856: And if the crystals were to fade-ethy...well, I hardly need spell out what that means.
10857: Though since Koru-Moru made it, I'd be remiss to assume That it will work without failure and not spell your doom.
10858: And if such a thing happens, I shall not feign surprise, For it wouldn't be the first time he caused someone's demise.
10859: Doctor Shantotto, please! Wait...it's pointing-areeno toward Misareaux Coast.
10860: Ah, but of course! It only makes sense. There's a vortex over there--how could I be so dense?
10861: There's been warnings-ethy about Escha all through the three nations. I'd be extra careful!
10862: So haul-diddly-daul tail!

10967: Well, look who's come to give their regards. Surely by now you've locked Kupipi behind bars?
10968: Regardless of her punishment, I hold those clothes dear. So we must get to the bottom of things, or her demise is near.
10969: Imagine my consternation at missing the competition. I should have won, not Zeid--it's simple addition!
10970: My outfit would have renedered everyone else obsolete. To think the crown was taken by someone with two left feet...
10971: Ah, I trust that you have brought me good news. So, please, spit it out, or you'll be singing the blues.
10972: Splendidly done, if I do say so myself. Everyone's memories are now right as books on a shelf.
10973: And now we know that Kupipi's at fault. When I'm done with her, she'll be locked in a vault.
10974: So what do you say? Think Kupipi must pay?
10975: Should Kupipi pay? [Through the nose./No!]
10976: Then we are of one mind. A comrade in arms did I find!
10977: What kind of detective is in cahoots with a crook? You stand with the villain--and it's not a good look.
10978: Oh, believe me, adventurer, Kupipi shall burn. I fear it's the only way that she will learn.
10979: And with that, I am off to plan my revenge. I shall see her carcass strung up on a henge!
10980: Ohohohoho!
10981: Surely Kupipi has been taught a valuable lesson. That will teach her to rely less on her rolanberry delicatessen.
10982: Next time her cheeks are aflush with delicious fruit, I'll head to Heavens Tower and give her the boot.
10983: For should she choose to ignore me to pursue plant-based delights, she'll have no mouth left to speak with, for I'll set it alight.
10984: But, adventurer, don't you agree that something's gone very wrong? It seems like everyone in Heavens Tower is a touch too far gone.
10985: It was an important day for the people who were there. How could they forget the truth you laid bare?
10986: It certainly does give one like me pause. It's not like they signed a non-disparagement clause.
10987: No, the cause of this is something far more sinister. I would swear to it as a former minister.
10988: I believe the one who should investigate is you. You have quite the knack for picking up clues.
10989: How do you respond? [Who? Me?/What should I do?/I think it's your fault.]
10990: Please at least pretend to pay attention. Or I might perform experiments on you too heinous to mention.
10991: Stop looking askance and head to Heavens Tower. Unless, of course, you enjoy making me glower.
10992: Return to the scene and learn all you can. Maybe we can figure out where the true culprit ran.
10993: They say the criminal always returns to the scene of the crime. Now hurry up, before we run out of time.
10994: So enough with the dawdling and head over there. You've a mystery to solve--after that, we'll be square.
10995: I sense a frightful disturbance at the center of all this. Surely, you too know that something's amiss.
10996: If we are to confront the evil that threatens us all, everyone must do their part--big or small.
10997: So focus on your task and stop blaming me. Unless, of course, you'd prefer to be cast out to sea.
10998: There's a price to be paid if we don't discover the truth. And if that price is your head, I shall offer it up forsooth.
10999: To Heavens Tower you go without further delay. You'll find answers there, not tomorrow, but today.
11000: And to Kupipi I bid you deliver a word. I'd send a pigeon, but I trust you more than a bird.
11001: Should she assist in getting to the bottom of this matter, I promise not to serve her head up on a platter.
11002: Now I must make preparations to meet with a leader. A professor whose nose is always buried in a reader.
11003: Several in Heavens Tower seem to have memory issues. I would shed a tear, but I'm all out of tissues.
11004: There's a sinister force behind all of this. If you could find out what's wrong, it would bring me nothing but bliss.
11005: So, [doubtful one/dear addventurer], please fulfill your charge. We know that somewhere out there is a criminal at large.
11006: And tell Kupipi to please assist with this case. If she does, she can consider her crimes erased.
11007: Ah, I see you've finally returned, detective. Hopefully, the information you have proves effective.
11008: Indeed, I am starting to see you in a new light. You've discerned the identity behind the sinister force that gave us all such a fright.
11009: Now then, let's get right to it, shall we? We must know the true identity of this culprit, don't you agree?
11010: Who is the culprit? [What are you talking about?/It's Uran-Mafran./It's the Maelstrom Mage, Garazu-Horeizu./It's Caboose.]
11011: Surely, you remember the incident at Heavens Tower? Speak now, or you'll be forced to witness my true power!
11012: I'm talking about the sinister force that stole everyone's memories and thwarted my victory at the Brygid Cup. Now stop stalling and tell me what you've turned up.
11013: Please, don't tell me you've forgotten... Or it'll be more than just your memory that's rotten.
11014: Caboose, you claim? Yes, I suppose that sounds somewhat like an evil mastermind's name.
11015: Unfortunately, your error shall prove to be quite tragic. As I need a new test subject for my deadliest magic!
11016: Hm? What's that I hear? Is it the sound of someone drawing near?
11017: Very well done, I do decree. However, I did not know that name until Koru-Moru told me.
11018: In fact, it was an inquiry from Bastok. It was then that I saw the name and my memories turned back the clock.
11019: Ah, you waste no time, I see. Although, I do enjoy it when adventurers get straight to the point like me.
11020: I came across a mention of Uran-Mafran in an inquiry from Bastok, I do believe. Immediately, the Maelstrom Mage was the image that my mind began to weave.
11021: Doctor Shantotto, who is this Uran-Mafran you're riddily-referring to?
11022: Whatever do you mean? That is a name from your mouth which I did glean.
11023: Uran-Mafran was a student in the advanced class when you were the School of Magic's principal, if I heard you right. In fact, you said his future was assuredly bright.
11024: Yes, now I remem-demily-member him!
11025: If I try thinking about a diddly-difficult topic, I tend to forget everything else-areeno.
11026: ...
11027: I have made-ethy a startling discovery! I finished reading the literature-ethy on the Maelstrom Mage!
11028: Ah, Professor Yoran-Oran... So who do you think-diddly-ink this Maelstrom Mage is?
11029: It is most definitely Garazu-Horeizu. He led the Yagudo in a coup attempt-ethy during the Fourth Yagudo War over three hundred years ago.
11030: At first, it was thought to be simply a battle-ethy for control of Sarutabaruta by the Yagudo, but whispers of a traitor-ethy began to emerge...
11031: Shortly thereafter, it was learned-ethy that the Maelstrom Mage, Garazu-Horeizu, was the one pulling the strings, and measures were taken to combat his hypnosis magic-ethy.
11032: Ah, that's right-aroo! When I was minister, I learned...err, tiddly-taught my students about that in history class.
11033: Although, why would he do such a thing-areeno?
11034: He was opposed-ethy by the Parliament of Patriarchs because the measures he suggested-ethy to the Star Sibyl were too radical...
11035: It seems the rejection of what he considered to be a groundbreaking theory-ethy capable of ushering in a new age of magic was the ultimate cause-ethy of everything.
11036: It's like he just snapped. Clearly, he wasn't impressed with their perceived failure to adapt.
11037: Ah, yes! That must be it-areeno!
11038: The wealthy Waters District merchant-ethy Honoi-Gomoi is the head of a family-ethy descended from Garazu-Horeizu.
11039: They kept a low profile-ethy from the main family, and its bloodline-ethy is directly linked to Uran-Mafran.
11040: You don't say-areeno... I guess this means Uran-Mafran was a rather diddly-determined fellow.
11041: Perhaps, but that sense of determination was misguided. I cannot agree with what he decided.
11042: Using the power of the orb to resurrect his ancestor is a waste! He should be using it to give himself untold power posthaste!
11043: Either way, I don't think the outcome-ethy would be all that great for us...
11044: I didn't think that Uran-Mafran had the power-aroo to manipulate the lives of actual living beings.
11045: After all, when he was a student-areeno, he was so good at madiddly-magic using puppets that he was called the "Puppet Master."
11046: Actually, I feel like there's someone-ethy like that right here...
11047: Now I remem-embery-ember! Wasn't it Uran-Mafran that stole Garazu-Horeizu's magicified doll-areeno from Heavens Tower?
11048: Naturally, it was him. If he thinks I'll let him get away with using the Yagudo as he pleases, he must be rather dim!
11049: It's strange... I think a madiddly-mage of Uran-Mafran's ability could easily res-riddly-surrect Garazu-Horeizu on his own.
11050: Perhaps it depends on how much magic the Maelstrom Mage imbued into that doll when he was still alive? That could be the difference in whether or not Uran-Mafran's magic can thrive.
11051: Normally, that would be true-aroo, but it seems the Maelstrom Mage's soul was off in some other world-areeno.
11052: Yes, that is correct. <Player>, I wish to hear your report. I have a feeling that it is a matter of great import.
11053: What!? Uran-Mafran nearly managed-ethy to resurrect the Maelstrom Mage!?
11054: Luckily for us, that demon managed to turn Uran-Mafran's own madiddly-magic against him. We should be safe-aroo for the time being.
11055: So Odin tried to use the Maelstrom Mage in order to bring about Ragnarok? That is a plan I'm glad someone was able to block.
11056: And if I die, will that demon take me to Valhalla as well? Is that the fate that awaits me once I hear the final bell?
11057: Naturally! Besides, even if someone were to kill-areeno you, Doctor Shantotto, you wouldn't die! Gahahaha!
11058: ...
11059: If you did somehow die-ethy, I think you'd rebel-ethy against Odin much like the Maelstrom Mage did...
11060: Yoran-Oran, do you have something to share? Or was I merely hearing things that aren't there?
11061: Ahem. If you were-ethy to visit Valhalla, Doctor Shantotto, I think the Maelstrom Mage would be at your mercy in no time-ethy.
11062: Of that, I have no doubt. And actually, that is exactly what I'm concerned about.
11063: In regards to Odin's sheer power... I sensed it when I traveled to the land of Aht Urhgan, and it was enough to make one cower.
11064: As far as I could tell... It seemed to be of a level that none could quell.
11065: Is that so...
11066: What's more, we just received the most terrifying news. Odin creating a demon for the purpose of this battle is a topic I'd rather not peruse.
11067: Simply replacing the soldiers that you have lost... Isn't that the perfect way to fight a battle at little to no cost?
11068: The Maelstrom Mage wields his dubious arts and has created many minions with his arcane touch. So why is it that he is struggling so much?
11069: Hmm... Maybe because of the demon-ethy known as Duke Alloces?
11070: It was somehow immune-ethy to Uran-Mafran's memory manipulation magic. Maybe, unlike us, mental-ethy attacks don't work on it.
11071: That's got to be the reason. I don't think Odin's army can be defeated, not now nor in any season.
11072: I think he may have fin-fiddly-finished his maelstrom theory...
11073: Is the maelstrom theory his research-ethy that was supposed to usher in a new era of magic-ethy?
11074: Yes, it is his theory that received so many dirty looks. Not only that, but it was also added to a list of banned books.
11075: I heard that if you don't get someone else-areeno to read the book as soon as you finish it, ghosts will come biddly-bursting out of its pages.
11076: No, that's not even remotely true-ethy. I heard that the book is so complicated that you could read it for eternity-ethy and never comprehend it.
11077: I wasn't able to find it, I must admit. I think you have to be a descendant of the Maelstrom Mage in order to even see it.
11078: Are you sure about that? I riddly-read it when I was younger. I mistook-aroo it for a book on the theory of love.
11079: So did ghosts come bursting from its pages-ethy?
11080: I didn't wait to find out-areeno! I quickly gave-aroo it to Karaha-Baruha! Ahahaha!
11081: But I immediately reg-riddly-regretted it. You see, that book was a book on love-areeno. If it wasn't, then he and the Star Sibyl would've never...
11082: Koru-Moru, that was definitely the book on the maelstrom theory. Tell us more about it, and be sure to speak clearly.
11083: Yes... To continue without rest-aroo for all eternity... I feel like it was a theory on how to wield madiddly-magic.
11084: Huh!?
11085: I-it's...
11086: You mean it's not a theory for me!? Oh, how can this be!?
11087: That is correct. It's a theory on love that states that love madiddly-magic shall always remain, forever unbroken-areeno.
11088: Still, I don't care! You must tell me the details before I begin to despair!
11089: Sorry, I for-fiddily-forgot the rest-areeno. Hehe.
11090: Perhaps your memory just needs a solid blow from my staff. Don't worry, I promise not to laugh.
11091: Even if you don't remember-ethy, you can always ask the Maelstrom Mage-ethy himself in Valhalla...
11092: C-calm down-areeno, both of you! The entrance to the underworld-aroo is curren-ciddly-tly closed!
11093: B-besides, maybe it's Uran-Mafran's fault-areeno that I've forgotten everything!
11094: Actually, our adventurer friend here said the same thing-ethy in [his/her] report. Uran-Mafran uses a magic doll to manipulate-ethy memories...
11095: So Koru-Moru, you're saying that we may have been the victims of his memory magic in the past. Is it possible that such a spell could've actually been cast?
11096: Doctor Shantotto, you seem to have recov-riddily-overed on your own, but normally it requires a rather detailed procedure-areeno.
11097: It appears that the $3 didn't have any effect-aroony on Uran-Mafran's madiddly-magic.
11098: Yes, and I suppose-ethy that means I can't do anything about it either. How about you-ethy, Professor Koru-Moru?
11099: Of course I can-aroo! I have this!
11100: Wha!? I've got a bad feeling-ethy about this!
11101: Do you really have to use that doll? Just its mere appearance casts a dreaded sense of pall.
11102: Uran-Mafran brought it with him, so it's just what I need-areeno.
11103: However, it won't obey-areeno my commands as-is, so I think-dinkily-dink I need to make some modifications first.
11104: So adventurer-eeno, you finally get a chance-aroony to help out.
11105: I'll need you to collect-aroo one of each of the following: $1, $2, and $3.
11106: $1 and $2? You need some riddily-rather unusual materials.
11107: Well, time is of the essence, so it can't be helped. Now, get a move on before you get yourself whelped!
11108: I don't think Koru-Moru's memory problems are the result of some Uran-Mafran spell... However, I guess only time will tell.
11109: We need you to get $1, $2, and $3. Oh, and be quick about it. Or else you'll really see me throw a fit.
11110: Umm... This isn't good-areeno... I am trying to immerse myself in recollections of my youth in order to remem-embery-ember the contents of the theory on love...
11111: Hm? You think I can't remember anything-aroony because of what Uran-Mafran did?
11112: I'm certain that's the case-areeno. I must rework this madiddly-magicked doll in order to restore my memories!
11113: For that, I require $1, $2, and $3.
11114: The book containing the maelstrom theory-ethy was banned. It's not something-ethy that can be talked about openly.
11115: So, how would you like-ethy to talk about mandragoras instead? Have you ever encountered a citrullus in your travels-ethy?
11116: One theory states that the citrullus is the original mandragora species-ethy. That can't be true-ethy, right? Right!?
11117: I see that you have brought that which we seek. Now, if you don't mind, I shall take a quick peek.
11118: Alright-areeno! Hand them over already!
11119: Ta-da! The mojo-mad-magicked doll "Memorian" is now complete-areeno!
11120: Koru-Moru, I'm sure your reworking of the doll was quite clever. However, it's still as creepy as ever.
11121: Now then, Professor Koru-Moru... Use the doll to help you recall-ethy the details of the maelstrom theory.
11122: Umm... Y-yes, it was a theory-areeno about being able to utilize madiddly-magic without rest for eternity...
11123: ...
11124: ...
11125: ...
11126: You didn't fall asleep just now, right? Because if you are, you'll be in for quite a fright.
11127: Ah, that's it-areeno! The egg! The "World Eater Egg"!
11128: What did you just say!? Repeat it again clearly, so that we are not led astray.
11129: W-we need more details-ethy! And please-ethy, keep it simple!
11130: The beginning of the maelstrom theory stated that it was a story-areeno told by the Yagudo reg-riddly-regarding a mysterious egg found in Sauromugue Champaign a long time ago.
11131: The monsteroo that hatched from the egg was terrifyingly strong, and it possessed such vitality that it was res-riddly-surrected every time it was defeated.
11132: I know that story. It's the story-ethy of the Nesnas. Did it really exist-ethy?
11133: The Maelstrom Mage heard a similar story about an egg in a corner of Aht Urhgan. It was known as the "World Eater Egg."
11134: To think that the Maelstrom Mage actually saw this World Eater Egg three hundred years ago... He is clearly one formidable foe.
11135: The World Eater Egg is a mysterious egg-areeno that cannot everoo be broken.
11136: However, once the monsteroo hatches, it is a creature with the ability-dility to be infinitely resurrected.
11137: Just what is this poweroo of resurrection?
11138: And what is the source-areeno of that poweroo...
11139: Whatever it is, that source must enable an infinite stream of magic to flow. Ohohohoho!
11140: I got it! Maybe the source of this power of resurrection-ethy is the one that birthed the egg!?
11141: I imagine that if a being is to be eternally resurrected... It would require a source of magical power with the equivalent of many lives injected.
11142: It may even be something as simple as a magic doll. Yet, I suppose it'd be difficult to properly resurrect something so many times if it were to fall.
11143: Well, it was the story-ethy of Nesnas. I know... What if it was a being with the power to control life-ethy?
11144: Indeed, there is the great Phoenix that I can recall... Not that I am trying to be some kind of know-it-all.
11145: I suppose it could be a possibility. However, as far as I know, Phoenix exists solely to save lives in the future so as to maintain stability.
11146: As such, I don't think it is capable of birthing the World Eater Egg. This clearly takes our theory down a peg.
11147: Hmm... So then what is the source-ethy of this power, Professor Koru-Moru!?
11148: In order to investigate the source, the Maelstrom Mage seems to have dir-diddily-directly asked the Star Sibyl for help-aroo searching for the World Eater Egg.
11149: What!? Although it appears he was refused-ethy...
11150: It seems that made him quite upset! I think we were lucky to successfully avoid that threat.
11151: Yes, that seems to be the case-areeno. However, he appears to have obtained new infomation when he started-areeno the Fourth Yagudo War.
11152: And what information-ethy is that!?
11153: Near the end of the book containing the maelstrom theory, there were some scribbles reg-riddly-regarding a large dragon known as "Chaos."
11154: There was also an arrow-areeno between Chaos and the World Eater Egg...
11155: Wait! Wait a second! The mystery-ethy is solved! This "Chaos" must be the one that gave birth to the "World Eater Egg"!
11156: Hm? <Player>...
11157: You look like you have something to say. Spit it out already, we don't have all day.
11158: I knew it all along. You hid this knowledge from us, even though you knew it was wrong.
11159: Yeah, what's the matter with you-ethy!? It's not nice to just sit there-ethy and let me think I made some amazing new discovery!
11160: And on top of that, what about this Caboose-ethy!? It went on a rampage trying to destroy all living things, yet a handful of beastmen-ethy were able to stop it!
11161: Hearing that Caboose was defeated five thousand years ago makes my eyes all teary. This could've been our chance to complete the maelstrom theory.
11162: Doctor Shantotto, have you forgotten that talk-ethy of the maelstrom theory has been banned? Isn't simply being involved with such a book-ethy an act of treason?
11163: Everyone, re-riddly-main calm. Also, it's "Chaos," not "Caboose."
11164: Moreover, this adventurer-eeno is clearly confused about a variety of things-areeno.
11165: There is a good chance that much-aroo like us, [he/she] is under the influence of Uran-Mafran's memory manipulation madiddly-magic.
11166: Ooh... Memories...stolen...
11167: Look, Memorian is reacting just-areeno as I anticipated.
11168: Huh!? Does that mean there might be more to learn? And here I thought there was no more to discern.
11169: It certainly does mean-areeno that. Here, I'll give this madiddly-magic doll to you.
11170: It should re-riddily-act to the memories that were tampered with by Uran-Mafran and then remove the effects of his spell-areeno.
11171: When you have a moment-areeno, you should try visiting locations-aroo that you have been to before.
11172: <Player>, if you find anything regarding the maelstrom theory, come to me at once. That is not the kind of information that should be shared with a mere dunce.
11173: No, you should tell me-ethy or Professor Koru-Moru first. It is vital that any buds of rebellion-ethy are plucked before they can sprout.
11174: Professor Yoran-Oran, I need to examine the maelstrom theory. In order to understand the Maelstrom Mage, I must pore over it until my eyes are tired and bleary.
11175: If Uran-Mafran's memories ever re-riddily-return, I'd like to capture and question-areeno him.
11176: Yes, I wholeheartedly agree. This is no time for me to squabble with thee.
11177: We must get to the bottom of these mysteries before Uran-Mafran returns. Then we can see just how brightly this plot burns.
11178: Finally, <Player>, I would like to give you this. If I let you leave without it, I would certainly be remiss.
11179: I believe it will help you on your journey to restore your memories. Be sure to keep it with your most prized accessories.
11180: It is always good to prepare for the worst. Now then, I think you should visit the Kingdom of San d'Oria first.
11181: Prince Trion has been quite vocal about various things. Especially regarding what kind of power the World Eater Egg brings.
11182: Of course, there is no need to mention the maelstrom theory. If you do, you will not find my mood to be so cheery.
11183: The maelstrom theory is a forbidden book, so you can be charged with treason. And I won't really care if you have a good reason!
11184: Is this another side effect that Uran-Mafran's memory manipulation has brought? Here, take this $1 that you forgot.
11185: I'm told that you should take the magic doll modified by Professor Koru-Moru as well. Maybe it can help break through Uran-Mafran's spell.
11186: If you have no set destination in mind, head for the Kingdom of San d'Oria before your memory's completely in tatters. Prince Trion seems to be quite curious about a variety of interesting matters.
11187: You should try to meet with him soon. Otherwise, he's likely to put on a disguise and sneak out of the country at the next full moon.
11188: Umm... This isn't good-areeno... I'm trying to riddly-recall my time as minister in order to remember-aroo Uran-Mafran's weakness...
11189: There must have been at least one student-aroo he was close with, but I can't recollect the name. I know he was male though... Yes, definitely male-areeno.
11190: The Maelstrom Mage, Garazu-Horeizu, died during the Fourth Yagudo War, and his soul-ethy was summoned by the demon and invited to Valhalla.
11191: Then, over the course of hundreds of years, he completed his maelstrom theory-ethy and acquired a source of inexhaustible magical power, enabling him to launch a rebellion-ethy against Odin.
11192: Based on our current assumptions, is such a thing possible-ethy, even when considering his vast intellect-ethy?
11193: Ah, it's you. Your face appears to be rather fresh and true.
11194: You look as if a great weight has been lifted from your heart. Yes, your aura has brightened considerably since I saw you last depart.
11195: Arrrrrrg... It's over... It's all over...
11196: Oh, it seems that magic doll has served its purpose at last. Now we can put its sinister visage in the past.
11197: Very well. What happens next, only time will tell.
11198: Now that it's all over, this magic doll is kind of cute, I must say... On second thought, I take that back. Clearly, the influence of Koru-Moru is still at play.
11199: This is an explanation of the Assist Channel feature, which allows new and returning players to seek help from veteran adventurers.

11310: I can start looking for new members immediately. Is this information correct?
11311: What will you do? [Start looking for members./Stop the process.]
11312: Your registration is officially complete.
11313: May your journeys lead you to many as-yet-unmet friends, and may the bonds you forge last a lifetime.
11314: Another member of that linkshell currently has an active registration. Please wait until that registration expires and try again.
11315: A manual describing proper chat manners floats in front of you.
11316: Read up on which topic? [None for now./I don't know what to talk about./How can I get people to like me?/What shouldn't I do?/What happens if we don't mesh?]
11317: Perhaps consider starting with a simple greeting. Something like...
11318: "Hello, everyone. My name's <Player>. Nice to meet you!"
11319: Of course, injecting your own personal flavor may act as a conversation starter and help people to remember you.
11320: No matter which route you choose, make sure to always remain polite. There is no better way to start a friendship off on the right foot.
11321: When speaking with others, it's critical to listen and be mindful of what they say.
11322: Always talking and never listening may come across as rude.
11323: Another important point is to always be mindful of the listener. How would you feel if someone said that to you? Think carefully before sending someone a message.
11324: It also helps to be clear and concise.
11325: Being vague might cause others to get the wrong impression.
11326: Be extremely careful when giving out personal information such as your address or telephone number.
11327: Furthermore, refrain from making disparaging or aggressive remarks.
11328: Once you are close to someone, you may be more comfortable letting your hair down, but it is strongly recommended that you refrain from any actions that may be construed as harassment.
11329: After joining a linkshell, you may find that you have difficulty participating in conversation or that your personality is too different from the other members.
11330: One of your options in such a situation is to inform the linkshell leader and then leave.
11331: Finding a linkshell that is the perfect fit might not always be easy, but there is certainly a group out there that will match your feelings and goals.
11332: Once you find those kinds of friends, hold them fast and value them as much as they value you. There is no better way to enjoy life in Vana'diel.
11333: The linkshell concierge opens up a tiny notebook...
11334: Here you can play the game Mandragora Mania.
11335: Do which? ($1 jingly) [Play (random opponent)./Play (select opponent)./Purchase prizes[ (unavail.)./ (reset avail.).]/Set start pattern: ([Random/A/B/C/D/E])./Set starting player: ([Random/You/Opponent])./Read an explanation./None of the above.]

11339: You may pay $& gil to reset all rewards, enabling you to purchase them again.
11340: Reset rewards? ($' gil). [Yes ($& gil)./No.]
11341: You do not have enough gil.
11342: All rewards have been reset.
11343: You have already purchased the $2.
11344: You need at least $3 jingly to purchase the $2.
11345: The reward exchange period has turned over and all rewards have been reset.
11346: You may reset all rewards from the appropriate dialogue box.
11347: Set starting pattern? [[/$26] Random (A-E)./[/$26] Pattern A./[/$26] Pattern B./[/$26] Pattern C./[/$26] Pattern D./[/$26] Pattern E./No thanks.]

11350: Starting player set to [Random/You/Opponent].
11351: Read the manual? [Sure./No thanks.]
11352: Mandragora Mania is a game in which you battle for jingly by moving your mandragora pieces to the goal.
11353: Your goal is the [red/blue/green] one on the right, while your opponent's is the [blue/green/red] one on the left.
11354: At the start of the game, three mandragoras each will be placed on the eight game areas, excluding the goal.
11355: There are five starting placements (A through E), and you are able to select which one you would like to employ. The default setting is "Random."
11356: This explanation uses pattern A, but the basic rules are the same regardless of the starting pattern.
11357: The three [red/blue/green] areas in front of you are yours,the three [blue/green/red] areas at the back are your opponent's,and the remaining two are neutral.
11358: You must choose one area--either yours or a neutral one--to proceed.
11359: The areas are numbered from one to five starting from the left, and any mandragoras in the area you select will move.
11360: Conversely, your opponent must select either a neutral area or an area that belongs to them.
11361: From the right, those areas are numbered 6, 4, 7, 2, and 8.
11362: For example, if you select Area 1,one mandragora will move to Area 2and one will move to Area 3,and one will move to Area 4.
11363: Note that the mandragoras will move from the back first--last in, first out.
11364: You will receive points known as "jingly" each time one of your mandragoras reaches the goal.
11365: You will enter your opponent's territory whenever you go past the goal.
11366: If one of your mandragoras happens to reach the opponent's goal, the goal will be pushed back and your mandragora will return to your own area. You don't have to worry about your mandragora earning any jingly for your opponent.
11367: The order in which players choose areas will be determined based on your turn settings. The default setting is random.
11368: This explanation has skipped past your opponent's turn for demonstration purposes, but in the actual game you and your opponent will take turns choosing areas.
11369: However, if the last mandragora to move reaches the goal, you will get to take an additional turn.
11370: Mandragoras are a very diverse species, and the amount of jingly you earn is determined by the species of mandragora that crosses into the goal.
11371: Adenium and citrullus: 3 jingly (first player)/4 jingly (second player).
11372: Korrigan and pachypodium: 2 jingly (first player)/3 jingly (second player).
11373: Standard mandragoras: 1 jingly (both players).
11374: The game is over when either you or your opponent no longer has any mandragoras that can move.
11375: The player who has the most jingly at that point will be declared the winner.
11376: The key to victory lies in taking advantage of the various mandragora subspecies bonuses while claiming multiple turns in a row.
11377: $7$7$7$7$7 Pattern [A/B/C/D/E] - Your Turn ([First Player/Second Player]) $7$7$7$7$7

11386: That area has no mandragora to move.
11387: You will forfeit all jingly earned this game if you give up. Are you sure?
11388: Really give up? [Yes./No.]

11402: Ohohohohohoho! How impressive!
11403: A demon messenger regaled me with the whole story.
11404: How you joined forces with the beastmen to defeat both Chaos and the Maelstrom Mage Garazu-Horeizu...
11405: You need not have worked so hard; you could have asked for our help, you know!
11406: Although, despite my shock, I must say that I am also somewhat in awe. Ohohohohohoho!
11407: Now then, I should like to hear every last detail of the ordeal from the one who lived it.
11408: Just what kind of magic did they use? And what was the battle itself like?
11409: My, my, my... Using such ancient magic to summon forth phantom projections...
11410: <Sigh> How unfortunate to lose one bearing such knowledge to the annals of history!
11411: Although, I suppose he actually died some time ago.
11412: At any rate, he was using actual souls for his experiments, right?
11413: He truly was a strange individual, wishing to become such a beast, despite obtaining ancient and powerful magic.
11414: If it had been me, I would have used Chaos to create a world where everyone could thrive.
11415: Ooh... The end is nigh... The end...is upon us...
11416: What did you say!?
11417: Although, I suppose it is not as outlandish as it sounds.
11418: The power of the crystals from the astral plane--the ability to draw upon the power of life itself--is more than sufficient to devour the world.
11419: If the cycle of soul rebirth were to break down again, it could awaken the beast from its slumber once more.
11420: In fact, we can already see the effects this ordeal has had throughout the world.
11421: Take, for example, the countless dead that continue to roam the land.
11422: They were resurrected via the power of life bestowed upon them by Chaos, and were then controlled by the Maelstrom Mage's magic.
11423: I heard later that the eye-like symbol at the heart of his ritual is something that has a long history in Aht Urhgan.
11424: That may be why it is still not easily understood, even after his death. Why does everything have to be so difficult!?
11425: Although, I suppose that it also means that it is easier for me to research his ritual now.
11426: I am also somewhat concerned about the news that there is yet another World Eater Egg in Aht Urhgan.
11427: They say that we need not worry since it lies deep within the ocean, but can we trust that assertion?
11428: Ah, that reminds me... You must not forget about the Maelstrom Mage's disciple, Uran-Mafran.
11429: Although, it seems that true to form, Koru-Moru has already forgotten about Uran-Mafran...
11430: I, however, have not.
11431: I still desire to read the Maelstrom Mage's Maelstrom Theory... In fact, I feel compelled to read it.
11432: Since then, I have searched the Optistery library numerous times, but have yet to find it.
11433: As such, I imagine the tome is in the possession of none other than...
11434: The Maelstrom Mage's descendant, the one and only Uran-Mafran. Indeed, that is the only logical explanation.
11435: Therefore, you can leave the matter to me.
11436: By the way, it goes without saying, but my search for this forbidden book is to be kept secret, understand?
11437: Ohohohohohoho!
11438: Hurry up now and accept my payment for your silence.
11439: Remember, no one is to know of my search for the book.
11440: The Maelstrom Mage was capable of that which I am not--the ability to manipulate others through magic.
11441: The reason for this discrepancy is I have no need for such an ability.
11442: Because everyone is powerless before my infinite might! Ohohohohohoho!
