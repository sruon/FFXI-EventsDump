## String References

- **7497**: Gwahaha, and now a pioneer comes to join me in this frozen hell! As long as you're here, can I ask you to do something for me?
- **7498**: The Scouts' Coalition sent me out here for a land survey, but the wind chills me to the bone, and I can't even feel my toes!
- **7499**: I need to study rime ice samples, but I can barely move. Can you go get some for me?
- **7500**: Rime ice can only be found when it's snowing outside. Makes sense, given the magma heating up the ground. Oh, this cold is terrible! I would kill for a blanket and a warm drink...
- **7501**: Hoho, some rime ice, I see. It doesn't look like much, but it lets us study what the snow's made of. Maybe we can even find out more about why it's so damn cold!
- **7502**: ...Wait...sulfur? The snow contains sulfur!? You don't think that the snow is made of hot spring water, do you?
- **7503**: I get it! Hot spring steam floats up into the sky, blocking out light. Then, the hot steam cools in the cold air above and comes back down as snow! ...Or something.
- **7504**: But hang on...why doesn't the ground get cold then? Argggh, there's so much we have left to learn! I'll have to bring this back to the coalition for further study.
