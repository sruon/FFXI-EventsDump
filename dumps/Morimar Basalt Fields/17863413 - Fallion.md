## String References

- **7509**: <Sigh> A hot spring resort here would be wonderful! ...But that's a bit of a pipe dream right now, unless pioneers are able to secure the area.
- **7510**: Until then, I'm looking for some help in analyzing the water of the major "hot spots" here in the Morimar Basalt Fields.
- **7511**: You would think this would be a simple task, given that there are only five main types of springs, but the truth is the smell, water quality, and what have you change depending on the time of day.
- **7512**: I've got a special testing kit prepared just for that purpose. If you want to get your feet wet, perform a simple examination of each of these five types and come back to me with your findings.
- **7513**: Be careful with that, okay? If you don't take the proper precautions, the whole kit--and kaboodle--will be ruined!
- **7514**: You're back! The pages of your report didn't get all soggy from the steam, I trust?
- **7515**: Aha! Just as I suspected. Antibacterial, skin treatment...yes, the popularity of these hot springs in Adoulin would boil over if we could secure the safety of the area.
- **7516**: Alas, it probably isn't meant to be. Not because of the monsters, mind you. One of my geomancer buddies recoils at the thought, launching into a tirade about how these hot springs are connected to the ergon loci--the source of geomantic powers. Those stuffy scholars, never willing to pay the price of progress.
- **7517**: Maybe we'll be able to convince them otherwise, but it's a moot point if you pioneers can't make the area safe for habitation.
- **7518**: A[/ boiling] hot spring bubbles at the surface.
- **7519**: You use the testing kit in the water. [Nothing happens/The color slowly changes/The color changes/The color changes quickly/The color changes almost instantly]. This hot spring has [a normal/a perfect/a strong/a very strong/an overpoweringly strong] smell to it.
