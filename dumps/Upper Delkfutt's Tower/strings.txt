 6766: Magic-wise, I'm good to go!
 6767: My magical reserves have recovered.
 6768: I have more than enough magic.

 6771: Hmm. Better keep an eye on my magic reserves.
 6772: Let's see now. I think my magic is about half gone.
 6773: My magic? It might be time to rest soon.
 6774: My magical reserves? Depleted to about the halfway mark.
 6775: I have around half of my magic left.
 6776: My magic is good for a while yet.
 6777: My magical reserves should suffice for now, but we best avoid taking unnecessary risks.
 6778: Are you relying on my magic? If so, we may need to rest soon.
 6779: I still have lots of magic left! Well, maybe half...
 6780: My magic? It might be time to keep an eye on my reserves.
 6781: Hmmm. I've used up half my magic already...
 6782: My magical reserves? Depleted to about the halfway mark.
 6783: My magical reserves don't require your sympathy just yet.
 6784: I've used up arrround half my magic.

 6790: Nooo... I'm almost out of magic...
 6791: Magic? I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel here...
 6792: My magical reserves are nearing depletion.
 6793: I'm almost out of magic.
 6794: Almost out of magic!
 6795: My magic is running low.
 6796: Where'd all my magic go!?
 6797: My magical reserves are running low.
 6798: My magic will no longer be of much aid. Stay sharp!

 6805: I've just leveled up, but with your help, it'll take no time at all to get to the next level!
 6806: Hey, I just leveled up, didn't I? Easy on the expectations there, partner.
 6807: Since I have just gained a level, it will be quite some time until I reach the next. Sorry to disappoint you, [sir/milady].
 6808: I've just gained a level. The next level is still quite a way off.
 6809: I just gained a level! You can't expect me to level again any time soon!

 6812: I have recently risen in level. The next level is still quite some distance away.

 6832: I think I must be almost halfway to my next level. Can't slow down now!
 6833: Hmm. I must be almost halfway to my next level by now.
 6834: I believe I've almost reached the halfway point to my next level. Let's not rest on our laurels, however!
 6835: I think I'm about half way there...
 6836: I'm half way there, so let's keep up the pace!
 6837: Through sustained effort and your invaluable assistance, I believe I now stand at the halfway point.
 6838: I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level. That was much faster than I expected.

 6842: I believe I've almost reached the halfway point to my next level. Let's not rest on our laurels, however!
 6843: I still haven't acquired enough experience. About double what I have now should be sufficient for the next level.

 6864: Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
 6865: I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
 6866: Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
 6867: Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
 6868: Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
 6869: Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
 6870: This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
 6871: I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
 6872: Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
 6873: My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
 6874: <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
 6875: I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
 6876: It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
 6877: ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
 6878: It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
 6879: Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
 6880: You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
 6881: You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
 6882: I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
 6883: Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
 6884: I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
 6885: Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
 6886: It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
 6887: There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
 6888: She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee.t The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!t
 6889: Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
 6890: Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
 6891: No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
 6892: Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
 6893: ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
 6894: Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
 6895: While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
 6896: It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
 6897: Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
 6898: I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
 6899: Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
 6900: Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
 6901: If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
 6902: Heal the worrrld.t Make it a better place.t For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.t
 6903: Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
 6904: You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
 6905: ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
 6906: A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
 6907: Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
 6908: You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
 6909: Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
 6910: By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
 6911: Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
 6912: By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
 6913: You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
 6914: A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
 6915: Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
 6916: Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...

 6949: You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? Why, we have only vanquished $0 [foe/foes] so far.
 6950: We haven't defeated many enemies yet. Only $0 so far.
 6951: We've only defeated $0 [enemy/enemies] so far. Nothing to write home about.
 6952: Our progress, [sir/milady]? The last foe bested brings today's tally to $0 [enemy/enemies].
 6953: We've only beaten $0 [enemy/enemies] so far. Don't tell me you're tired already!?
 6954: Only $0 [enemy has/enemies have] fallen to us today! We're just getting started!

 6957: You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? Why, we have only vanquished $0 [foe/foes] so far.
 6958: Only $0 [enemy/enemies] defeated so far. This doesn't even amount to a warm-up.
 6959: We've beaten at least two...right?
 6960: Defeated enemies? That was number $0.
 6961: I'd say we've blasted through around $0 [enemy/enemies] by now!
 6962: How many enemies have we defeated? Hmm, around $0...
 6963: You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? The last villain we defeated brings us to number $0.
 6964: You want to know how many enemies we've beaten so far? Let me check... It's $0.
 6965: The last one we took care of makes number $0, right? Not too shabby, if I do say so myself.
 6966: Our progress, [sir/milady]? The last foe bested brings today's tally to $0 [enemy/enemies].
 6967: We've defeated about $0 [enemy/enemies] now. That should quieten things down around here!
 6968: I would say we've taken out around $0 [enemy/enemies] by now. Still more work to be done!
 6969: The last enemy we defeated was number $0. As far as I remember.
 6970: How many enemies have we downed? Umm...around $0. I think.
 6971: You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? The last villain we defeated brings us to number $0.
 6972: Our tally stands at a meager $0 enemies. This is unacceptable. We're picking up the pace!
 6973: We've beaten a lot more than three now...prrrobably.
 6974: Defeated enemies? That was number $0, I believe.
 6975: I'm just guessing here, but I'd say we've destroyed about $0 [enemy/enemies] today!
 6976: Enemies defeated? I wasn't really keeping track. Around $0, I suppose...
 6977: You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to $0.
 6978: How many enemies we've defeated? Isn't it something like $0?
 6979: Let's see... So far we've wiped the floor with $0 enemies. Good job!
 6980: The last foe bested brings today's tally to $0 [enemy/enemies]--a most impressive figure. Shall I prepare tea and biscuits?
 6981: We just beat enemy number $0. They just keep coming, don't they?
 6982: The last enemy we took down was number $0...I think.
 6983: That last enemy brings us to a total of $0 [enemy/enemies] defeated. We've been busy.
 6984: Umm, let's see here... We've beaten $0 [enemy/enemies] today, right? I've totally lost count...
 6985: You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to $0.
 6986: We've already rid the land of $0 enemies today, but it doesn't seem to make even the slightest dint in their numbers.
