## String References

- **14665**: Wow, I've never heard that before. You know everything, Grandpa!
- **14666**: Huh? Oh, a customer! Happy New Year!
- **14667**: What? Who was I talking to just now? Oh, the other day, this really nice old man gave me my very own $0 so I could call him whenever I wanted. He teaches me all sorts of things, and all I have to do is call him "Grandpa" and do whatever he says.
- **14668**: Just now, he was telling me about the fun-loving people walking around outside. I heard that something similar to this happened many years ago...
- **14669**: He also told me that if I give 'em something, they'll give me $0 in return. I really wanted one, so I was all ready to go through that gate over there when the guard gave me a nasty look...
- **14670**: Hey. You're an adventurer, right? Doesn't Altana say that you guys have to help little kids or your brain will melt and bugs will eat your ears? Go out and get me $0, ASAP. Don't worry, you'll get your reward!
- **14671**: Whoa! You really brought me back $0. Thanks!
- **14672**: I guess you'll be wanting your reward now, huh? Hmmm... How about I give you a choice?
- **14673**: I'll... [Let you ask Grandpa a question./Give you something from my pocket./Tell you more about Grandpa.]
- **14674**: Eh? That's all you want? Well, okay.
- **14675**: Hold on. I'll see if I can get through. Grandpa has a lot of little friends just like me, so his line is always busy.
- **14676**: Oh, hi Grandpa! Uh-huh... Yeah... Uh-huh... Sure... Uh-huh... Yeah... Okay... Sure... Uh-huh... Uh-huh... No, but... Yeah... Okay... Uh-huh... Right... Uh-huh... Not really... Sure... Okay... Uh-huh... Yeah... Uh-huh... I can do that... Uh-huh... Great... Yeah... Sure... Uh-huh... No... Not today... Maybe tomorrow... Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah... Uh-huh... Wait... Actually, the reason I called was because there is this adventurer who wants to ask you a question.
- **14677**: Ask [him/her] [his/her] name? Okay. [Mister/Lady], what's your name?
- **14678**: <Player> points to the name over [his/her] head.
- **14679**: The [guy/lady] says [his/her] name is <Player>. Think we can believe [him/her]?
- **14680**: Okay, adventurer. Grandpa told me to tell you this...
- **14681**: The sable spirit of Diabolos looms in your wake.
- **14682**: Just as the ruler of dreams extends his nebulous arms to emancipate the righteous, you too harbor within your heart the strength to remain calm in dire straits, and lead those lambs who have strayed into the abyss to the light of victory.
- **14683**: In other words, he's saying you're a born leader! Why, shouldn't you be out gathering a party and giving orders, or something?
- **14684**: Oh, and he also says that even though you may have the makings of a great [man/woman], people will never follow you unless you tack some "bravery" and "drive" onto your resume. Go figure!
- **14685**: The scintillant spirit of Carbuncle hovers above you.
- **14686**: And just as the delicate ruby light from the bringer of rainbows soothes the weary soul, so too does the soft, warm radiance that shines forth from your heart unto those in need.
- **14687**: In other words, he's saying you're always nice to people. You know, helping them out with their problems and stuff. If you're not already a white mage, maybe you should think of a profession change.
- **14688**: Oh, and he also says that the only way that people will ever respect you is if you help them without expecting something in return. Kind of like helping a kid get a New Year's gift without wanting some kind of reward when you're done, wouldn't you say?
- **14689**: The dynamic spirit of Ramuh walks by your side.
- **14690**: Just as the world glows with his electric wisdom, your mind too glows with an infinite intelligence that sends shudders of excitement and awe throughout the masses.
- **14691**: In other words, you're a smart [guy/lady] who is chock full of curiosity and is always looking for a change. You wouldn't happen to be a red mage, would you?
- **14692**: Oh, and he also says that if you would just pay a little more attention to those around you, people might not say all that bad stuff behind your back. Go figure!
- **14693**: The lofty spirit of Titan towers above you.
- **14694**: Just as his adamantine will shields the meager from destitution, you too tread the path of life with caution while providing sanctuary for all souls who gather in the warmth of your heart.
- **14695**: In other words, you think before you act, unlike those creeps who shoot first and ask questions the next Firesday. Your ability to quickly identify an enemy's weak point and finish him off before he hurts your friends makes you good black mage material.
- **14696**: Oh, and he also says that if you were only a little more honest, then people might respect you more than they do that guy at the chocobo stables who sells everybody the gysahl greens with the bugs in 'em.
- **14697**: The whispering spirit of Garuda whisks about you.
- **14698**: Just as the avatar of wind roams free across the never-ending skies of Vana'diel, so too does your lucid heart yearn to break free of the chains that bind it to conformity.
- **14699**: In other words, he's saying that you were born to be an adventurer, and that your free spirit would make you a mighty good thief, if there is such thing as a good thief.
- **14700**: Oh, and he also says that you'd be a lot more popular if you'd stop trying to impress everyone and just be yourself. Go figure!
- **14701**: The lustrous spirit of Leviathan watches over you.
- **14702**: Just as the radiant visage of the guardian of seas renders vapid souls breathless, the pristine balance between your attention to beauty and respect for harmony are the waves upon which your companions cast their vessels.
- **14703**: In other words, that "pristine balance" helps you from being swayed by the poison opinions of others, and grants you good judgment in sticky situations. Add to that all that talk about harmony, and it sounds to me like you'd make a good bard.
- **14704**: Oh, and he also says that if you'd stop worrying about what you wear on the outside and concentrated more on polishing what's inside, people might actually stop avoiding you. Go figure!
- **14705**: The chilling spirit of Shiva shadows your soul.
- **14706**: And just as her veil of hoarfrost hides the world from the eyes of men, you too don a shroud of discretion as you journey alone through the valleys of solitude.
- **14707**: In other words, he's saying that you're a calm, cool, and collected player who has an answer for all the challenges life throws at you. Sounds like blue mage material to me!
- **14708**: Oh, and he also said that if you'd stop picking out people's faults and concentrate on what they've got on the inside, maybe you'll learn what true friendship is. Ouch!
- **14709**: The searing spirit of Ifrit walks alongside you.
- **14710**: Just as the inferno within his soul spits forth flames of undying emotion, the fire deep in your heart burns with the passion and determination to face any challenge.
- **14711**: In other words, once you've set your mind on something, a bucket full of pamama au lait ain't gonna stop you from charging in the room and unloading your quiver of bloody bolts on anything that stands in your way. Sounds like a grade-A warrior to me.
- **14712**: Oh, and he also said that if you would start being a little more decisive, people would stop refusing to be in your party because they thought it was going to take you three days to decide on a place to camp lesser colibri. Go figure!
- **14713**: The daunting spirit of Odin stands alert at your side.
- **14714**: Just as the mighty conqueror's ambition drives him to Victory's bosom, so too does the harmony within your heart guide stray souls to the paths they seek.
- **14715**: In other words, he's saying that your belief in your faith, along with your hating of all that is wrong, keeps your heart pure--pure enough to endure the trials of a paladin.
- **14716**: Oh, and he also says that you're actually really sensitive, but too ashamed to show people your true feelings, so you pent them all up inside. You'd better fix that or you'll find yourself battling some nasty ulcers. Cheers!
- **14717**: The noble spirit of Fenrir guards your shadows.
- **14718**: Just as the guardian of the moon's light drives darkness from the kingdom of night, you follow the sun across land and sky, from dawn until dusk, from birth until death. You see the world on a scale that dwarfs even the mightiest of mountains and their snow-laden peaks.
- **14719**: In other words, he's saying that you're always in search of a good time, and are always up to speed with the latest fads and fashions. Maybe you should think about being a corsair or a puppetmaster. Come on! Everyone's doing it!
- **14720**: Oh, and he also said that your refusal to act normal every now and then freaks a lot of people out. Keep that in mind before you go running down to the auction house wearing only your subligar.
- **14721**: The mighty spirit of Bahamut hovers above you.
- **14722**: Just as the Wyrmking rules the skies with his mere presence, so too do you stand above lesser men with your distinct aura of fortune and conviction.
- **14723**: In other words, he's saying that by combining the logic and ideals that clutter your brain with a little of the luck that saves your lazy bum all the time, you'd have the power to summon great power...like a summoner!
- **14724**: Oh, and he also says that if you'd stop trying so hard and rely a little more on the smiles that Fortune keeps wafting your way, people might actually think you're competent. Go figure!
- **14725**: Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah, [he/she] looks really pleased with your answer.
- **14726**: You want me to tell [him/her] that, too? Alright. Grandpa says that all journeys begin with faith in oneself. Take a good look at what lurks inside before stepping out...
- **14727**: Whatever that means. I don't understand half the stuff he says, but I like him because he gives me candy.
- **14728**: I knew it. You adventurers are all alike. Here, take this. It was getting sweaty in my pocket anyway.
- **14729**: You want to know about Grandpa? Actually, I don't know if I can tell you much.
- **14730**: He comes to visit sometimes, and gives me presents, but he never says where he's traveled from or where he's going.
- **14731**: Although earlier today on the linkshell he said something about being somewhere high up where he could see for malms...
- **14732**: Although earlier today on the linkshell he said something about being able to see some big white contraption...
- **14733**: Although earlier today on the linkshell he said something about it not costing so much when he was younger...
- **14734**: Although earlier today on the linkshell he said something about being able to see some huge-mongous tree...
- **14735**: Although earlier today on the linkshell he said something about traveling back and forth...
- **14736**: He said the same thing yesterday, so he may still be in the same place. Are you thinking about going and getting some candy, too?
