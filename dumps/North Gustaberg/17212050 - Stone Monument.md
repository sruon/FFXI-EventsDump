## String References

- **7465**: You see a message engraved on the stone:
- **7466**: As I passed through this area, I heard Bastokers were building a monument honoring the pioneers who dug the Palborough Mines. Being the curious type, I went to visit the site.
- **7467**: The site itself turned out to be an old cemetery, where the tombstones were so old, the names were worn away with age.
- **7468**: It turned out that the graves were those of numerous Galka who died in an accident the day the Metalworks was completed, in a time when Bastok was still struggling to become a nation.
- **7469**: I do not know if the Palborough Pioneers are the heroes people claim they are. I, for a fact, have no doubt the Galka who lie here gave their lives bravely to settle this arid, forsaken land.
- **7470**: I decided to spend a night here, drinking to the unnamed heroes of a forgotten time. --Gwynham Ironheart, 749 Crystal Era.
