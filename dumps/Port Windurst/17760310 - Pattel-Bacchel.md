## String References

- **16042**: Whew! Been fishing up a storm all day, and my eyes are spinning-winning. Why, I couldn't tell a bluetail from a bibikibo in the state I'm in!
- **16043**: Still, I caughtaru twenty fish today. Not bad for a rookie like me, wouldn't you say?
- **16044**: Some of the bigwigs around here say they've caughtaru more than ten times that, but that sounds awful fishy-wishy to me.
- **16045**: Anyway, I'm going to take a breather. Another day (Earth time) or so and I should be fresh as a forest carp. If you ever find yourself pooped after a long day of fishing, I suggestaru you do the same!
