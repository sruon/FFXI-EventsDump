    → "Eh? You say somethin'?\u0007Hmph! You dang kids these days ain't got no respect for your elders. Can't you see I'm tryin' to learn this new fandangled fishin' method? In my day, all we had to do was cast a line and wait for the baby to tug. Why, back then it was so easy, I could catch fish while I was sleepin'!\u007F1\u0000\u0007"

What's changed? Well, nothing yet! Would you just hold your horses and let me get to the good part?\u007F1\u0000\u0007"

    → "Now, once you feel the pull is where the real battle begins--and I say battle because that fish is not going to let you get him without a fight! If he starts tuggin' to the left, you've gotta pull to the right. If he starts tuggin' to the right, you've gotta pull to the left.\u007F1\u0000\u0007"

If you \u001E\u0005confirm\u001E\u0001 a little too early, the fish may still have enough pep to run off with your bait. But if you spend too much time playin' with him, he might just get bored and be on his way.\u007F1\u0000\u0007"
