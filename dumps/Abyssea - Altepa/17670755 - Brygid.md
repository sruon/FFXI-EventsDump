## String References

- **8216**: Yes? I'm a very busy girl. So, off with you now! Don't call me, I'll call you! Ta-ta!
- **8217**: Wait a minute. You're not <Player>, are you?
- **8218**: Well, color me disappointed! What with you being the talk of the desert these days, I was expecting someone with a half-decent sense of style.
- **8219**: I mean, really, what is that armor supposed to be? Empi...Empa...Empo-whatever you want to call it, it's just so totally not you.
- **8220**: Listen, you may fancy yourself some big-time brawler, but in a battle of style? I'd wipe the floor with you, hon.
- **8221**: What mountain hut did you crawl down from? Here's a tip, dear: neglect your appearance, and people neglect you. It's a material world, and you're just livin' in it, hon.
- **8222**: How can I put it...? There's a fine line between cute and cloying, and let's just say you've crossed waaaaaay over it.
- **8223**: Good heavens, is it Harvest Festival time again? I couldn't tell you, but I can say that that costume has got to go.
- **8224**: Let me guess: you're the type who wears the same thing day after day after day. Learn to vary up your wardrobe, honey, or people will take you for a dreadful bore.
- **8225**: Hmm? Was someone talking to me? Oh, I'm sorry. Your clothes are so drab that I seem to have forgotten you were even there.
- **8226**: What are you supposed to be, some kind of a knight in shining armor? That is soooooo eighth century.
- **8227**: You might want to tone down the whole "[Master/Mistress] of Shadows" look, hon. Nobody likes a brooding, overemotional drama queen.
- **8228**: My eyes! They burn! No offense, hon, but if I were your pet, I would have run away a long time ago.
- **8229**: If you're trying to compensate for lack of musical talent with style, let me just tell you, hon, you're playin' the wrong tune.
- **8230**: Earth tones, you say? Does that mean you just got through rolling around in a compost heap?
- **8231**: So you're going for the exotic look. Sorry, hon, you could travel a million malms east and not find a land where you'd be in style.
- **8232**: If you're trying to look like one of the horde with those garish colors, you're doing a bang-up job. Don't come crying to me if the Resistance puts a bounty on your head.
- **8233**: How about this? You make a pact with me never to wear that hideous outfit again, and I won't report you to the Resistance fashion brigade.
- **8234**: I've seen Goblins with better fashion sense than you.
- **8235**: I've seen Goblins with better fashion sense than you. Maybe you could learn something from them?
- **8236**: Uhm, here's a fashion tip, "matey". Your captain's get-up looks awfully lame out here in the middle of the desert. Aye, it does.
- **8237**: I hate to say this, hon, but if someone said you looked good in that, they were just pulling your strings.
- **8238**: Does everyone in your troupe have Goddess-awful fashion sense, or is it just you?
- **8239**: You call yourself an academic? I suggest hitting the fashion books before you show yourself in public again.
- **8240**: If you're trying to draw upon the power of nature with that getup, I'd be surprised to hear the vegetation around you doesn't wither and wilt before you even cast a colure spell.
- **8241**: It's painfully clear to me that you've had your head stuck in books about the runic arts instead of putting it through fashionable robes and capes.
- **8242**: But hey, take heart. For I, Brygid, Abyssea's fashion advisor extraordinaire, am here to set you straight.
- **8243**: Yes, it's perfectly clear. That face, those proportions... $0 and $1 would totally be you.
- **8244**: If you're not ready to be a trendsetter, don't sweat it. Keep wearing those scruffy rags. It's your loss, not mine.
- **8245**: Are you ready to shine? [I'm afraid not./Just watch me!]
- **8246**: No problem, hon. It's like the saying goes, you can lead a bedraggled adventurer to a smashing subligar, but you can't make [him/her] put them on.
- **8247**: How can I worry about fashion these days? Shows what you know, hon. In this dark, drab world, there's no better way to stand out and inspire the confidence of others.
- **8248**: Let me see there. Yes, yes... Turn around for me if you will, hm? Oh, there's no doubt about it. Night and day. A whole new you!
- **8249**: Why, I daresay this is my greatest work yet. Here, take this to commemorate the day you took an express airship from frumpy to fine!
- **8250**: Still wearing that goddess-awful Empi...Empa...Empo-whatever-armor, I see. Listen, hon, you're getting my advice for free, so what say you take advantage of it, hm?
