## String References

- **8116**: Looking for Zacc and Enu, you say? Oh dear, you must be new around here. Everyone knows the poor souls lost their lives to a fiend months ago...
- **8117**: What's that? Alisa said they'd be back any minute? Oh, dearie me...
- **8118**: <Sigh>... The poor girl. It all happened so suddenly, it's no wonder she still can't accept that they're gone...
- **8119**: The monster that took their lives? Why, it was a positively frightening thing they call the Bugul Noz. Surfaces only on the rarest of occasions, it does. Sadly, Zacc and Enu just picked an unfortunate time to go for a stroll...
- **8120**: Poor Alisa--to lose the family she held so dear, and be left with only this old crone in their place. Oh, if only it could have been me that day! I'd have traded my life for theirs in a heartbeat...
- **8121**: It was the fearsome Bugul Noz that claimed Zacc and Enu's lives that day. For ones so young and full of promise to be taken from us like that...this is a heartless world, indeed.
- **8128**: What's that? You've slain the Bugul Noz, you say?
- **8129**: Nothing will bring Zacc and Enu back to us, but at the very least there will be no more loved ones lost to that horrid thing. This may not be much, but please take it with my gratitude.
- **8130**: Perhaps we'll finally see some small measure of peace around here. Alas, that's probably too much to hope for...
- **8131**: I hear that Alisa has her memories back, for better or for worse... Don't you worry, though, dearie. You've done all you can.
- **8132**: I'll keep a close eye on her. It's all an old woman like me can do in times like these.
- **8158**: You'll be happy to hear that Alisa is smiling again for the first time in ages. Her heart still weighs heavy, I'm sure, but she's finally starting to resemble her old self again.
- **8159**: Call it an old granny's hunch, but here's betting that you had a hand in this.
- **8160**: I don't know where you're from or how you did it, but ever since you come around, people's spirits have gotten a goodly bit brighter. Promise me you'll stay close by, you hear?
- **8291**: If there ever was a Goddess, she's long since forsaken us.
- **8292**: As you can see, dearie, I don't have too many years left. How I wish I could live them out in peace!
