## String References

- **8021**: .........
- **8022**: Wha...! Don't sneak up on me like that! You almost made me drop this $0.
- **8023**: ...Wait a minute. You're not with the Resistance. <Player>? Never heard of you.
- **8024**: Listen. I'm a big-time soldier, and I definitely don't need the help of some scruffy-looking stranger.
- **8025**: Even if my captain had ordered me--speaking hypothetically, of course--to take this $0 and gather soul prints of the most savage, bloodthirsty fiends prowling about the desert, it would be child's play to someone as tough as I am.
- **8026**: If you still were to insist upon meddling in my mission, and by some stroke of undeserved fortune were to succeeed, I suppose I would then have to reward you in some way. ...But I wouldn't be happy about it.
- **8027**: Offer to help anyway? [Uh, yes?/Uh, no?]
- **8028**: Good. I never asked you in the first place. When will people understand that I can take care of myself?
- **8029**: You again? Can't you just mind your own business?
- **8030**: How many times do I have to tell people I can take care of myself? Sheesh! You're even worse than my sister.
- **8031**: I bet you don't even know that to use a $0, you need to insert a $1 and then point it at your target. Or that you can find a supply of both in those caskets over there.
- **8032**: If you manage to take some prints without impaling yourself on a cactus or something, bring them back to me and I'll explain everything you did wrong.
- **8033**: If you're actually able to gather some intel on the fiercest fiends, I might actually give you a reward. I'd rather not, though, so feel free to get yourself killed.
- **8034**: Oh, you're back. I was hoping one of the fiends got you. I guess you want me to take a look at this...
- **8035**: Wh-wha...what's the big idea here? Are you trying to show me up or something!?
- **8036**: I've been on the trail of this one for weeks. I was this close to nabbing him myself. Why did you have to butt in?
- **8037**: I've never even seen a fiend this powerful before! And to think I could have found him myself if only you hadn't gotten in the way.
- **8038**: Well, you're not as incompetent as I thought. Though of course I could have done better.
- **8039**: <Sigh>... Now you're probably expecting a reward for the help I never asked for in the first place. Fine. If I give you this, will you leave me alone?
- **8040**: Oh, how wonderful. Blurry and useless, just as I expected. Guess it takes a real pro like me to snap the head-on, point-blank shots we need. You could try again, but why bother?
- **8041**: How charming. Perhaps next you could bring me a picture of a cutesy widdle baby chocobo chick. Clearly, it takes a real soldier to square off against the most formidable fiends. Someone like me.
- **8042**: Yes? I'm sorting through these $0, and I certainly don't need your help. Find someone else to bother.
- **8043**: I may never have graduated from the academy, but I must be strong... For sis...and for everyone...
