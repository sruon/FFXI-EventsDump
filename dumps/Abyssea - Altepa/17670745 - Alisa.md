## String References

- **8113**: How curious! Whatever could be keeping those two...?
- **8114**: Oh, hello there. Have you perhaps seen my dear family? My husband Zacc and daughter Enu, that is...
- **8115**: They must have just gone for a little stroll around the camp. I'm sure they'll be back any minute now.
- **8122**: That's the pendant I gave to Enu! Whyever do you have it?
- **8123**: I...I don't understand... Enu...she was here a few h-hours ago... And Zacc...th-they just went for a walk...
- **8124**: Wh-what...what is that thing!? Don't you see it!? Enu...behind you! Zacc...run! Run for your lives!!!
- **8125**: This can't be happening! Oh, please, Goddess have mercy! No! Noooooo...!
- **8126**: ...I remember now. That day, my husband and daughter were...devoured by that horrible thing. Right before my eyes, yet I could do nothing...
- **8127**: I am sorry... Please leave me alone with my thoughts for a while.
- **8133**: Oh...you've returned. Please forgive me for my outburst before. The truth...it was simply too much to bear.
- **8134**: In fact, there is a small favor I would ask of you. I realize my request is bold--and so soon after losing myself in front of you the way I did--but it would mean the world to me.
- **8135**: This $3 belonged to my daughter. I would like for you to take it and bury it as close to the sky as you can.
- **8136**: Oh, how Enu adored this pendant! And how she loved to gaze up at the night sky... Why, even now, I can feel her gentle eyes watching over me from above.
- **8137**: Though it could never make up for all the joy she brought to me, I just want this pendant to be close to her again...
- **8138**: Please. It would mean so much to me. To Enu...
- **8139**: That $3 belonged to my daughter Enu. Please take it and bury it as close to the sky as you can. It would mean ever so much to me...
- **8152**: You found a place close to the sky for Enu's $3? Thank you, friend. You are truly a kindhearted soul.
- **8153**: Y-you...you what? You met them!?
- **8154**: My daughter... She said that...? Oh...oh my...
- **8155**: Oh, what a weak-willed fool I've been all this time!
- **8156**: Zacc and Enu may no longer be with me, but I must be strong. For their memory, and for the friends who remain by my side...
- **8157**: I must be strong, and carry on. My family still smiles down upon me from above. This knowledge alone gives my life meaning.
