## String References

- **10595**: Nashmau was once a supply port for the Imperial fleet, but it was abandoned long ago. The reason is quite eerie...
- **10596**: This town was plagued by a horrible epidemic, so everyone fled elsewhere. Now as you can see, there's nobody but Qiqirn here...
- **10597**: But I'd rather be here than spend my time in Al Zahbi wondering when the beastmen are going to come for my hide.
- **10606**: There's this Qiqirn named Buburoon who does nothing but stare at the ocean... Do you know what he's waiting for?
- **10607**: He's waiting for a ghost ship called the Ashu Talif. It would be really something if you could see a ship full of dead people near an abandoned town like this, wouldn't it?
- **10608**: But with my rotten luck, I haven't ever even gotten a glimpse of the ship... Maybe it was just a mirage after all.
