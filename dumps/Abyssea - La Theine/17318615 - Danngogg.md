## String References

- **7827**: This veridical conflux here is a lifeline for us survivors. At the touch of a hand, it'll instantaneously transport you to any other conflux with which you've had contact. As long as you have enough cruor to power it, that is.
- **7828**: For the sake of quick identification, all confluxes discovered in the area have been allocated numbers. The one at which I stand sentry is the first. Follow the highroad south, and you will eventually come by the second.
- **7829**: Now, if only there were a conflux that would take me back to my beloved Bastok...
