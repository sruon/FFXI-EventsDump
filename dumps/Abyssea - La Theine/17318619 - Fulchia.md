## String References

- **7837**: If you've a mind to outlive your peers, then heed my words. When engaged in combat with an Abyssean monster, you would be well advised to exploit its weakness.
- **7838**: While massive damage may not be dealt in so doing, you'll most likely succeed in impairing the movement and abilities of your foe.
- **7839**: Know also that changes have been observed to occur depending on your choice of killing blow. Do not be shy to experiment should the opportunity present itself.
- **7840**: My last piece of advice, you may choose to ignore only at your peril: Abyssean monsters are drawn to commotion.
- **7841**: A battle that rages on in one area will for a certainty attract uninvited guests, each one stronger and deadlier than the last. If left unharassed for a time, however, the dreadful ones will grow bored and leave in search of better sport.
