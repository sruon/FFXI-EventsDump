## String References

- **7856**: Besides where you stand, two other encampments have been established in La Theine. 'Tis from these three locations that we survivors wage resistance against the Abyssean hordes.
- **7857**: If you seek the central encampment, you must first follow the mountains south. Beyond the first valley you will find two ponds, one large and one small. Nestled into the ravine north of there is where you will find your destination.
- **7858**: The southeastern encampment can easily be reached from the central encampment. Simply strike for the plateau's easternmost edge, and thence follow the mountains south. The rest should be self-explanatory.
- **7859**: For the nonce 'tis all we can do to stay alive. But mark my words, the Kingdom of San d'Oria shall rise from the ashes and purge the land of the foulness that corrupts it!
