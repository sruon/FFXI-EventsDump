## String References

- **7827**: I've been hearing troubling things, lately. The beastmen are rising again, they say.
- **7828**: It's not true, is it? I couldn't bear another war like twenty years ago. Those were dark times for all of Vana'diel.
- **7829**: I'm scared... I'm very scared. My husband, my children, my friends...all the people I've come to know these twenty years. I will not lose them to another war!
- **8690**: <Player>'s badge flashes brightly.
- **8702**: I hear frightful tales from the Near East. They say that the beastmen are leading armies into the lands of people.
- **8703**: That badge... It is as if the terrible events of twenty years past have returned to haunt us...
- **8704**: Yes, the nation they speak of lies far away, yet I feel the seed of fear blossom in my heart. War is like a raging fire that leaps from country to country, consuming all in its path...
