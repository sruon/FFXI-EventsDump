- **7139**: Renounce your rank at which guild? [None./Carpenters'./Blacksmiths'./Goldsmiths'./Weavers'./Tanners'./Boneworkers'./Alchemists'./Culinarians'.]
- **7140**: If you proceed, your rank in the [Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild will return to that of [craftsman/artisan/adept], and your skill value will revert to the maximum for that level. This procedure cannot be undone, so please consider your decision carefully.
- **7141**: Renounce your rank as a [Carpenter/Blacksmith/Goldsmith/Weaver/Tanner/Boneworker/Alchemist/Culinarian]? [No, retain./Yes, renounce.]
- **7143**: And you are? This is the Alchemists' Guild. In other words, an organization that researches the origins of the universe, and puts that knowledge to use in the development of new medicines and items.
- **7144**: Oh, you must be looking for the shop. It's down the stairs, on your right.
- **7145**: Well, well, well. An adventurer. Then we shall start you with crystal synthesis.
- **7146**: You must already know, but crystals house different forms of energy. Crystal synthesis taps that energy and utilizes it to transform matter.
- **7147**: The success of crystal synthesis depends on the images of the product made by the user. In other words, the better the user, the better the image, the better the final product.
- **7148**: Obviously, the more experience you accumulate over the years, the more skilled you will become.
- **7149**: If there is anything you don't understand, ask the alchemists here in this guild. You are now one of their companions!
- **7150**: To master alchemy is to know the universe. And to know the universe requires time.
- **7151**: Along with the mastery of alchemy, you have obtained the knowledge of the universe. However, knowing the universe means having the power to destroy it. Such power is not to be trifled with.
- **7152**: I sense that you have attained enough knowledge to move on to the next plane of alchemy.
- **7153**: Make $0 and I will further entrust you with the secrets of the universe.
- **7154**: ... This work seems to be flawless. I hereby entrust you with the title of [amateur/recruit/initiate/novice/apprentice]. I look forward to you seeing your future work.
- **7155**: ... Fine work, <Player>. I hereby entrust you with the title of journeyman. Do not squander your skills.
- **7156**: Wonderful! I am proud to have you stand by my side as an artisan.
- **7157**: The day has finally come. You are now worthy to be called an adept alchemist. Let us, together, reap the benefits of the vast knowledge of the universe.
- **7180**: A perfect job...as always, I might add. I hereby bestow you with the honorary title of veteran. I would not be suprised if you have attained the skills to turn mere lead into gold!
- **7181**: Excellent work. I have no difficulty in bestowing upon you...the title of craftsman.
- **7205**: What brings you here? Well, $0, of all things... You couldn't hope to make one without some $1, but I fear they aren't often stocked by vendors.
- **7206**: But you strike me as an intrepid type, so I'll share with you some knowledge to help you on your way. Head over to Ordelle's Caves. Hunt enough bats there, and you might just come into some $0. That's the main ingredient required to make $1.
- **7207**: All that remains, then, is to bind it with $0 using $2. Good luck!
- **7269**: The time has come, <Player>. The time to move beyond your limits as [a veteran/an expert/an authority/a luminary/a master] and seek the answers to yet deeper questions of our universe. I trust you are up to the task?
- **7270**: Up to the task? [I am!/I am not...]
- **7271**: Yes, of course you are. Your answer was known to me long before I posed the question. Acquire yourself a copy of $6 from Hemewmew, and we shall proceed from there.
- **7272**: An alchemist of your caliber need not be told that nothing in our universe comes without a price, and that a nominal fee in guild points must be paid to obtain the tome.
- **7273**: All for the better. Pursuing alchemy with imperfect focus has been known to lead to madness, disaster...or worse. When you are prepared to devote the entirety of your soul to our practice, you may return. And not a day before.
- **7274**: Acquire yourself a copy of $6 from Hemewmew, and we shall proceed from there.
- **7275**: Say not a word, <Player>. It is as plain as day to me. You have familiarized yourself with the contents of $6.
- **7276**: Very well. Create for me $2. This is what you will need. Listen well--the prospect of repeating myself does not amuse me.
- **7277**: And be sure to leave your name upon your work. Why, you say? I would think it obvious, but will leave the question for you to ponder.
- **7278**: Have the fumes gotten to your head? I've already told you that making $2 requires...
- **7279**: Yes, this shall do. You have taken one step closer to true knowledge, <Player>. I bestow upon you the rank of expert. From this day on, let us unravel the mysteries of this universe together.
- **7280**: Is this some poor attempt at humor, <Player>? No self-respecting alchemist would be so ignorant as to submit for review a work that did not bear their name.
- **7281**: Let it suffice to say that I am not entertained. Return to your laboratory and do not return without that which I asked you for.
- **7282**: People have begun talking of your work. Their words have even wafted all the way to the halls of this guild. You are ready for your next trial. Create for me $0.
- **7283**: Pass, and you will be accepted as [an artisan/an adept/a veteran]...and then I will show you the true power that the universe hides.
- **7284**: However, you must take care. Bearing the name of [artisan/adept/veteran] means you must clear your mind of all stray thoughts, and focus on the task before you. Why, you ask?
- **7285**: In alchemy, losing your focus could result in a tragedy of universal proportions. This is why we advise against becoming [an artisan/an adept/a veteran] in more than one guild.
- **7286**: Of all the disciplines, alchemy demands the highest degree of focus from its practitioners. Entertain even a moment's thought of striving for [artisan/adept/veteran] status in another guild, and true knowledge of the mysteries of the universe will forever elude you.
- **7287**: I have received word that you have accepted the title of [artisan/adept/veteran] from another guild. Tell me, <Player>, did I not advise against this course of action?
- **7288**: Your blatant disregard of my warning does not please me...
- **7289**: However, I offer you the opportunity to redeem yourself of your errant past. Revoke your [artisan/adept/veteran] status from any lesser guild and you will be forgiven.
- **7290**: I will inform the other guildmasters of your decision, so that you may return immediately to your research. Do we have an agreement?
- **7291**: Perhaps I was wrong... Perhaps there are things in this world more important than the study of alchemy...
- **7292**: Could it be that it is not you who strays from the true path, but I? No! Such thoughts are madness! I must...not...waver...!
- **14094**: Ask if this person is the chick's owner? [Yes./No.]
- **14202**: You've...you've got my chocobo?
- **14203**: ... What a relief...
- **14204**: I thank you for your kindness, [sir/ma'am]. As thanks, let me teach you a story I often tell my chocobo...
- **14218**: There are two kinds of chocobos in this world: those that belong to me, and those that don't. The chocobo that you speak of is one of the latter.
- **16539**: Oh, hello again. Hm? If I may inquire, what is that shield in your possession?
- **16540**: Ahh... I see you have met with her.
- **16541**: Of course, I heard the story about a special shield that can improve your crafting ability when equipped. Hahaha. I have no idea how it works though.
- **16542**: Although, if the theory behind it is sound and it actually works, I would be quite interested to know more about it.
- **16543**: I am well-versed in your abilities, and if she chose you for this task, then I suppose you just might have what it takes to make the shield.
- **16544**: Now then, we will first need to go over the recipe. It is important that you remember this, so listen carefully, take notes, do whatever it is you need to do.
- **16545**: So, the first ingredient you are going to need is $1...
- **16546**: The function of this particular ingredient is to boost the Craftsmanship of the $0 to its full potential.
- **16547**: I actually have some information regarding Craftsmanship. I will read it out loud for you before you get started.
- **16548**: You can increase Craftsmanship by crafting items that match up with your skill while you have the $0 equipped.
- **16549**: Craftsmanship will increase greatly when you fulfill certain conditions, but crafting the same item over and over again will reduce your gains, so try synthesizing something different if you run into trouble.
- **16550**: In its default state, the shield has the unfortunate tendency to lower the success rate of your crafting, but as its Craftsmanship rises, it mitigates that effect.
- **16551**: You can tell the Craftsmanship rating as well as the crafting success rate by looking at the shield. Good luck to you. Mwahaha...
- **16552**: Did you get all of that?
- **16553**: Once you have got the Craftsmanship rating up, come show me how you did. Then, I will be able to make you the $1.
- **16554**: After that, you will need $2 and $3, which you can get from Yek Falimeygo.
- **16555**: You have delivered various items to people before, right? That is basically what you will need to do to get those ingredients.
- **16556**: Go speak to Yek Falimeygo for more information.
- **16557**: That covers the ingredients you need. Be sure to show me the shield once you have upgraded it. I am very interested to see how it turns out.
- **16558**: Hm? You forgot the recipe already? Okay, here are the materials you need, but a craftsman of your caliber really should be able to remember these things.
- **16559**: You promised that we would always work together to improve our crafting skill. If anybody can do this, I am certain that it is you.
- **16560**: Impressive... I think you have successfully demonstrated the process. This should enable me to produce the $0...
- **16561**: So, this is the $0...
- **16562**: By pouring my heart and soul into the shield, I was able to form this crystal. Although the theory behind the process is quite straightforward, it still amazes me to see it in action.
- **16563**: Hmm... In crafting the $0, it seems to have decreased the Craftsmanship of the $1.
- **16564**: It is no problem to upgrade the $1, but you will need to raise its Craftsmanship first if you wish to craft the $0 again.
- **16565**: Well, I know you are quite responsible and I am certain there is no way you could ever lose something so important.
- **16566**: What did you say? You somehow managed to lose the $0? How is that even possible?
- **16567**: I even warned you about such a thing, too... Okay, give me the shield. I will craft another $0.
- **16568**: You are a highly-skilled craftsman. As such, you need to make sure you take care of your ingredients.
- **16569**: It looks like you managed to make the upgrade. Let me see how you did.
- **16570**: Hmm... The shape has changed and I can feel a small amount of power emanating from it. Yet, it is still not enough to prove the theory.
- **16571**: I suppose it is just as she said it would be. Unless you craft with it multiple times, you will not get the results that you are expecting.
- **16572**: That reminds me, she wanted some kind of proof that the shield was done. Here, wait just a moment...
- **16573**: That should do it.
- **16574**: Just show the shield to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno.
- **16575**: Lastly, please note that I always have deliveries to be made to Yek Falimeygo. I hope you will help train and educate the junior members of our guild.
- **16576**: Ah, it's good to see you. She's already told me about your next task.
- **16577**: Now, let's go over this new recipe, shall we? Pay attention, you're going to want to remember this.
- **16578**: There you go. Did you get all of that?
- **16579**: Next, let's go over how to obtain the ingredients, starting with the $1.
- **16580**: First, you'll need to equip the $0 and craft with it until its Craftsmanship reaches 100%.
- **16581**: It's just the same as when we made the $1 before. However, you're going to need to make even more of an effort this time.
- **16582**: Bring me the shield once it's reached 100% and I'll make the $1 for you.
- **16583**: Next up is the $2. Do you remember the $3 from last time? I've given both it and the $2 to Yek Falimeygo.
- **16584**: Next up is the $4. I've partnered with the A.M.A.N. to create some Records of Eminence objectives for you.
- **16585**: You can check the Records of Eminence menu for more details. You'll receive the $4 once the objectives are complete.
- **16586**: That covers the ingredients. You know, it takes hard work and dedication to prove a theory like this is valid. That's why you're the perfect person for this job.
- **16587**: Hmm... It looks like you were successful.
- **16588**: I guess that means it's my turn. Here, I'll make the $0 for you now.
- **16589**: Okay, all finished.
- **16590**: Hmm... It looks like the shield's Craftsmanship has dropped again.
- **16591**: You need to take proper care of this thing so you don't need to come back to me again.
- **16592**: I must say, you never cease to amaze me. Well done.
- **16593**: You can really feel the difference compared to the previous shield. Its power is only going to increase as you unlock its potential.
- **16594**: Okay, let me mark the shield to prove the process is complete.
- **16595**: That should do it. Take the shield and show it to Mewk Chorosap.
- **16596**: I see you don't give up so easily. Very well. You may attempt the final objective once more.
- **16597**: Ahh... There you are. Shall we go over the next recipe, then?
- **16598**: Oh, you already know it? Forgive me.
- **16599**: Okay, you would like to know how to obtain the $4 and $5? Very well. Listen carefully.
- **16600**: Our guild has received an order for a particular item, but I need you to fulfill the order for me.
- **16601**: However, this one's a bit of a strange request, you see... Although there are a few exceptions, you need to craft the item close to the customer that placed the order.
- **16602**: Apparently, they want to make sure you know what you're doing and also keep an eye on the quality of the finished product. They won't accept items crafted anywhere else, so be sure to keep that in mind.
- **16603**: You'll need to gather the materials necessary to make the requested item. I'll leave how you obtain them up to you.
- **16604**: It's still in the trial phase, but an agreement between the guilds has enabled you to purchase certain products that were previously unavailable.
- **16605**: You can purchase the products from the vendor responsible for selling crafting sets in each guild.
- **16606**: However, each guild has its own set of guidelines. You may not be able to purchase the item you need, but you might get lucky from time to time.
- **16607**: Once you've delivered the goods, I'll give you the $4 and $5.
- **16608**: Did you get all that? This is the [first/next/final] request.
- **16609**: Deliver $1 $0 to Morunaude at the furniture shop in $7.
- **16610**: Deliver $1 $0 to Boizo-Naizo at the Manustery in $7.
- **16611**: Deliver $1 $0 to Silver Owl at the Tenshodo in $7.
- **16612**: Deliver $1 $0 to Boizo-Naizo at the Manustery in $7.
- **16613**: This particular item does not need to be crafted near the customer.
- **16614**: Remember to report back to me after you've completed the request.
- **16615**: Let's see... Your current request is to...
- **16616**: How is the request coming along? I hope everything is proceeding apace.
- **16617**: Everything okay? [Everything's great!/It could be better...]
- **16618**: Yes, I suppose I shouldn't worry so much. Let me know when you're finished.
- **16619**: Hmm... That's unfortunate, but I have faith in you. Just consider this to be a test of your abilities, and you'll see it through to the end.
- **16620**: Will you see this through? [I'll do my best./I've had enough.]
- **16621**: I see... Well, I guess I'll have to find somebody else to take care of this request, then.
- **16622**: You seem to be tired both mentally and physically. Try resting for a while and I'll give you another request when you're ready.
- **16623**: Well? Are you all rested up now? If so, let's get back to work.
- **16624**: Thank you for your report. You did a good job out there.
- **16625**: It looks like you've made the final delivery. I couldn't have done it better myself.
- **16626**: Now to give you the $0 and $1 as promised.
- **16627**: If you ever need these two items again, you can trade guild points for them.
- **16628**: I really have gotten quite good at this. Maybe someday, I can use these same principles to realize my dream of creating gold.
- **16629**: I see... So this is what the shield looks like this time around.
- **16630**: Hahaha! It really is a thing of beauty! It brings a smile to my face just looking at it.
- **16631**: According to her calculations, this next upgrade will unleash the shield's untold power. At last, the ultimate shield is within your grasp.
- **16632**: Oh, I almost forgot. I have a new crafting technique to teach you. You've already come so far, I'm sure you'll have no trouble using it.
- **16633**: Ah, there you are. If this procedure is done properly, this shield will possess extraordinary power.
- **16634**: Now then, let us discuss how to obtain the materials you will need.
- **16635**: I see you need $2 and $3.
- **16636**: Of course, you will need to exchange crafter points like you normally do. If you have enough points, go visit Yek Falimeygo to exchange them.
- **16637**: Next, you will require $1. The method for obtaining it is the same as before; hand me your shield once its Craftsmanship reaches 100%.
- **16638**: That concludes the explanation. The path that lies before you is clear. I look forward to seeing you reach its destination.
- **16639**: Now, you already know about the $0, right? I believe Mewk Chorosap is looking for it, so take it to her.
- **16640**: Ah, it's you again. What can I help you with?
- **16641**: Hmm... You must be referring to the item that Tarutaru from Adoulin requested that I make.
- **16642**: I apologize, but you are too late. I have already sent it off to Jeuno.
- **16643**: I imagine it has been delivered to Mewk Chorosap by now. You will have to go and check for yourself.
- **16644**: Ah, you came at just the right time. Look here. The $0 that I sent to Jeuno was just sitting here on my desk.
- **16645**: It really is quite strange. Hm? You say you need this particular item? Very well. You are free to take it.
- **16646**: Hmm... Look at this emblem...
- **16647**: So this is what the completed shield looks like... I see the guild emblem I crafted is prominently displayed.
- **16648**: Hahahaha! If this is not perfection, I do not know what is!
- **16649**: This has been most entertaining. While this is not much of a reward, I would like to teach you a new crafting technique. I am certain you will have no problems mastering it.
- **16650**: I believe it will help open up the future of alchemy. However, my research on the matter is incomplete. I look forward to finding many breakthroughs in the field together!
