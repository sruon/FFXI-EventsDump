## String References

- **10829**: What do you want? Oh, you think because I'm just a kid you can walk over and talk to me for no good reason?
- **10830**: True, I might look like a child now, but I know I was once a great warrior, and I can prove it.
- **10831**: Do you want to see proof? [Yes./No.]
- **10832**: I wasn't going to show you anyway. I know your type. Patting kids on the head and thinking how great life was when you were their age, right? Spare me, please.
- **10833**: I thought so. Well...all right, here. But be careful! It's very, very valuable--it's a piece of my past life.
- **10834**: A friend gave this to me over twenty years ago. I can't remember what it all means, though.
- **10835**: I showed this to my friend Gumbah once, and his opinion was that this is a very valuable document that tells you each monster type's weakness.
- **10836**: He said it will come in handy when I become an adventurer.
- **10837**: You've been a good pupil. Come back anytime if you want to see it again. Well, at least until I leave on my first adventure...
- **12548**: <Player>'s badge flashes brightly.
- **12549**: What do you want? Oh, you think because I'm just a kid you can walk over and flash that badge at me for no good reason?
- **12550**: True, I might look like a child now, but I know I was once a great warrior, and I can prove it. Your little badge doesn't impress me.
