## String References

- **12313**: Have you seen any crazy Goblins riding around on chocobos lately, kupo?
- **12314**: Oh, you don't have to worry. They probably won't attack you. They're playing a game with us moogles, kupo!
- **12315**: You see, we take these cards and bury them around the outskirts of town. Then the Goblins go out and try to find them. If they do, they can bring them back to us and exchange them for different prizes, kupo.
- **12316**: This time, we spread them out all over the area, thinking that the Gobs wouldn't be able to cover that much land, kupo.
- **12317**: But that was before we learned that they had their own chocobos!
- **12318**: It's just not fair, kupo!
- **12319**: Now it's only a matter of time before those stinking beastmen find all the cards and we moogles lose the game, kupo!
- **12320**: And that's why we need your help, kupo! Would you go out into the field and find the cards before the Goblins do?
- **12321**: There is a variety of different sets. For each set you bring back safely, I'll secretly give you the present that we were going to give the Goblins, kupo!
- **12322**: For starters, why don't you try finding $5, $6, and $7? That should throw those smelly Gobs for a real spin, kupo!
- **12324**: If you have any extra time on your hands, try finding more card sets, kupo! We really have to stick it to those Gobs this year to show them who's boss!
