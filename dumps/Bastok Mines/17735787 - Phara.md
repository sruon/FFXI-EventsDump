## String References

- **11029**: Good day, young whipper-snapper. You look as if you've been working hard.
- **11030**: Good day, young [lad/lass]. I can see that you've become quite the adventurer. When you get to be my age, you can tell these things, you know.
- **11031**: My darling son, may his soul rest in peace, was a warrior, and so was my grandson...until he decided to quit and become a doorman.
- **11032**: My son didn't teach him how to wield a sword so he could go waste his skill on being a doorman. That boy just doesn't understand...
- **11033**: He didn't even take his father's sword with him.
- **11034**: Sure, it may be a little old and may need a few repairs. I think that the handle requires some kind of special part...
- **11035**: I remember my son saying he had found $6 in a tent when he and some great Galka named Ragarimin, or something like that, went on an expedition to the Orcs' stronghold.
- **11036**: If you happen to stop by there on your way somewhere, picking some up would make me ever so grateful.
- **11037**: Well I'll be! You've brought me $6! I'll ask my sweetie in the Blacksmiths' Guild to fix it all up, good as new.
- **11038**: I'm sorry. I have no way to repay you now. Could you please come back tomorrow?
- **11039**: Thanks to you, my son's sword is as good as it was the day it was forged. I'm sorry to bother you any further, but could you take this to my grandson?
- **11040**: To get to where he's stationed, I hear you have to ride this newfangled elevatie contraption.
- **11041**: They say that doormen get decent pay, so you can get your reward from my grandson. I'm sure he won't mind.
- **11042**: His name? Oh, it's Naji.
- **11043**: So, you took the sword to my grandson? Hmm...and the sword was connected to that Sir Ragimorimm character?
- **11044**: Now that you mention it, when Sir Ragamuffimm was a young'un, he was always acting all grown-up. Why do you suppose that is..?
- **11045**: All those Galka praising the likes of him... Except for one. There was one who hated that Sir Ragamamm.
- **11046**: Yes, I remember my son having a bit of trouble with that fellow. I think his name was Deidogolly, or something like that.
