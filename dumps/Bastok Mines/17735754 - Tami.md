## String References

- **10822**: Hey, you're an adventurer, right? Could you take this note to my husband? He forgot to take it with him.
- **10823**: My husband's name is Zelman. You'll find him in the Zeruhn Mines. He's a miner. All right, then, off you go!
- **10824**: What? He thinks doing the groceries isn't dignified? Ha! That's a laugh! And just who does he think's putting food on the table while he's off taking naps in that little hole of his!?
- **10825**: You bought this, didn't you? Hmm... I was going to give this present to my husband, since he needed some cheering up lately, but...
- **10826**: Since you did his chores for him, it's yours. Well, he always wanted to be an adventurer himself, so he should be happy knowing you have it.
- **10827**: Ah, did you find my husband? Good. I keep telling him to check his pockets before he leaves, but he never does. Anyway, here, take this. For your trouble.
- **10828**: My husband used to listen to me a lot more when we were young. It'd be funny if he was going through a rebellious phase at his age!
- **15618**: A Starlight Celebration present for me? Well, aren't you a thoughtful young [lad/lass]! That reminds me, I should get something for that useless husband of mine, too...
