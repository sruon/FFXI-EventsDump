- **7707**: Kupo-whoa-whoa there, pardner! Care to saddle up and help us rustle up a couple o' wild buffalo? 'Cause we've got a stampede on our hands, I reckon!
- **7708**: Lend a hand? [<Skedaddle away.>/A stampede, you say?/I reckon I will.]
- **7709**: Well, sit down and grab a sarsaparilla, and I'll tell you the tale, kupo. You see, the Mog House Management Union (MHMU) ain't too popular among the townsfolk these days, and they've been talkin' with their wallets by not sendin' too many gold nuggets our way, if you catch my drift.
- **7710**: But seein' as how we moogles are an enterprisin' bunch, we done hatched ourselves a plan, y'hear?
- **7711**: A plan we call... The Buffalo Bonanza Ranch! Yeeeeee-hawww!!!
- **7712**: Rustle up a herd of the most darn-tootin' fearsome buffalo from over and yonder, throw a fence around 'em, and you done got yerself the rip-roarin'est dude ranch this side of the Rio Rafeloux, kupo!
- **7713**: Set up a saloon on the side serving scrumptious buffalo burgers, and you've got contented customers filling our moogle coffers with mucho dinero... Comprende?
- **7714**: That there was the plan, pardner.
- **7715**: So we lassoed up a herd o' ill-tempered buffalo from the mountains up north, and were leadin' our li'l dogies back this-a-way to town...
- **7716**: And that's when we hit a bit o' a snag.
- **7717**: Dagnabbit if I know where they came from, but a swarm of confounded chigoes done showed up!
- **7718**: Now y'see, these buffalo come from the mountains, and ain't never seen the likes of no chigoes before. They raised a right ruckus, and next thing y'know, we done had a stampede on our hands!
- **7719**: Y'ever see a stampedin' buffalo? Even our moogle hypnosis did 'bout as much good as a poke in the ear with a rusty cattle prod, kupo!
- **7720**: That's where you come in, pardner. What say you saddle up and help us moogles round up these beasties?
- **7721**: For each buffalo you capture, we'll give you one o' these here "bovine brands." Collect 'em and mount 'em and you'll be eligible to win a veritable bonanza o' special prizes!
- **7722**: % looks at you with puppy-dog eyes...
- **7723**: Now, I'd do this myself and save y'all the trouble, but jus' look at me... One kick from a stampedin' buffalo and my puny moogle body'd be flung right to the other side o' Vana'diel, I reckon!
- **7724**: Y'all got nothin' to worry 'bout, though. As big and sturdy as you are, I reckon you'd only fly to just over yonder a-ways.
- **7725**: And as an added bonus, you can trade the bovine brands you've earned for a whole kit 'n caboodle o' Buffalo Bonanza Ranch goods and prizes! Yeeeeee-haw, kupo!
- **7726**: So how's about it, pardner?
- **7727**: % gazes at <Player> with a steely glint in his eye.
- **7728**: Saddle up? [I think I'll pass./Sure. Yeee-haw!]
- **7729**: Yippie ki-yi-yay!!! Much obliged, pardner!
- **7730**: If your cow-herdin' skills are up to the task, we'll stamp you some "bovine brands" on this here sheet.
- **7731**: Once you've racked up your share o' brands, just mosey back on over here to claim your prizes!
- **7732**: So sharpen your spurs, and when you're ready, herd up the buffalo and lead them to the moogle cowhand in area [G-9/I-8/G-9/H-9/H-6/I-7], kupo!
- **7733**: Ready to go? [Tell me more about the buffalo./How about some help, pardner?/Giddy-up!]
- **7734**: All right, now go rustle yerself up some buffalo! Yee-haw!
- **7735**: The big beastly ones are the bulls, the bosses o' the herds. The midsized ones are the mother cows, and the li'l-bittiest ones are the baby calves.
- **7736**: The calves are sweet little thangs. Don't even have to hypnotize 'em; they'll follow their mother's scent just 'bout anywhere.
- **7737**: By the by, we got ourselves a bottle o' Eau de Buffalo here. We moogle cowpokes use it to disguise ourselves with the mother buffalo's scent. It's only got $3 [dose/doses] left, but they're all yours, pardner.
- **7738**: 'Course, there ain't no need to fret if it runs out. Just brush yerself up against one of the mama cows and you'll get a natural shot of Eau de Buffalo just like that.
- **7739**: But you'd best be careful, 'cause they be some hot-tempered heifers, y'hear? You'll be wantin' to sneak up on them from behind, all careful-like, to avoid their charge.
- **7740**: As for the bulls, I'm quakin' in my boots just thinkin' 'bout 'em. They're the nastiest, most foul-tempered beasts this ol' cowhand's ever laid eyes upon. You'll be wantin' to steer clear of 'em and stick to roundin' up the cows and calves, kupo.
- **7741**: And don't you be forgettin' that these buffaloes, they always act as a herd, y'hear? So don't go mixin' the herds, or we'll have a right ruckus on our hands.
- **7742**: And you'd best take care to keep the chigoes away, too. One li'l bite from them and the buffalo will really start goin' loco, I reckon.
- **7743**: With this here bottle o' Eau de Buffalo, we can make you smell just like one o' the buffalo mamas. It's runnin' low, though, so you'll want to be usin' it wisely, I reckon.
- **7744**: Apply the scent? [Not now./Sure.]
- **7745**: A dab or two o' buffalo sweat, a dab or two o' milk, and...kupo!
- **7748**: Sorry, pardner, we done exhausted our supply. Reckon you'll just have to do it the hard way...
- **7749**: That's a cryin' shame, pardner.
- **7756**: You've wrangled yerself the following buffalo, pardner:
- **7757**: %0 %1
- **7758**: %0 %1.
- **7759**: Feelin' a bit tuckered out? You ain't caught yerself a single buffalo yet.
- **7760**: Ain't got the time for that now, pardner... We've got a stampede on our hands! We'd be much obliged if you could help us rustle up these buffalo, pardner. Go talk to my compadre by the city gates if yer interested.
- **7762**: How goes it, pardner? [Keep on herdin'./Ask about the buffalo./Get the mother's scent./Mosey on home.]
- **7764**: You've got yerself $0 bovine [brand/brands], pardner.
- **7765**: Trade in for a prize? [Not now./$0 ($1 brands)./$2 ($3 brands)./$4 ($5 brands)./$6 ($7 brands)./$8 ($9 brands)./$10 ($11 brands)./$12 ($13 brands)./$14 ($15 brands)./$16 ($17 brands).]
- **7766**: Trade $1 brands for $0? [No thanks./Giddy-up!]
- **7767**: Here we've got a special beverage made from buffalo milk, with a dash o' moogle magic. Darned if I know how it works, but one swig o' this and you'll up and transform into any critter you touch. You'll be best buddies with the buffalo in no time, pardner!
- **7768**: This here's a belt crafted from the finest buffalo rawhide, soaked in buffalo milk, and left to dry out under the burnin' sun. Got a bit of a foul odor, but it works just like $0.
- **7769**: With this here stylish mantle, not only will you be the most dashin' cowhand for miles, you'll be able to dodge those blasted buffalo charges a couple'a times, to boot!
- **7770**: This here's a limited-edition Buffalo Bonanza Ranch cowhorn. It's just a li'l decorative doodad, so it don't make no sound, but word has it that it can make you as rich as a gold mine!
- **7771**: Handle this hot and heavy new waist attire straight from the heavy horns of the belligerent buffalo Toro himself!
- **7772**: Handle this hot and heavy new waist attire straight from the heavy horns of the belligerent buffalo Miura himself!
- **7773**: Our wonderful workers of hide have fashioned this fantastic cap that can turn you into a buffalo calf, kupo!
- **7774**: This conspicuously convenient cap was crafted by a masterful Moogle weaver and inexplicably increases the amount of time you can ride your mount, kupo!
- **7775**: This key waas found in a suken shup! Amazing, kupo, but for a limited time only!
