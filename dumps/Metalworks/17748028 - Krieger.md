## String References

- **7904**: Can I help you? This is the Cermet Refinery. Normally, only factory workers are allowed in, but...
- **7905**: Well, I guess you're okay. Do you know what cermet is? It's an alloy that's harder and lighter than steel, doesn't rust, and can withstand extreme heat. Amazing, isn't it?
- **7906**: It's the byproduct of recent breakthroughs in alchemy. Thanks to cermet, Chief Cid's engine designs are now years ahead of their time!
- **7907**: In fact, cermet...ah, no, I can't tell you any more. Just that...if we manage to find a way to cut down its production cost, we can put those Galka smiths on the spot!
- **7908**: This is the Cermet Refinery. The factory is off-limits to unauthorized personnel.
- **7909**: Then again, even if those anachronistic San d'Orians did manage to get in, they probably wouldn't be able to make heads or tails out of our instruments!
