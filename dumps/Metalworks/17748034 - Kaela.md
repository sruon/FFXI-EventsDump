## String References

- **8005**: That star is here...no, it's in that constellation there... Hm? What am I doing? Oh, I'm trying to match real stars with the ones on this map, but it's not as easy as it looks.
- **8006**: Say, you're an adventurer, aren't you? You must've been to a lot of places, seen many different skies... Would you like to take a look?
- **8007**: Look at the stellar map? [Yes./No.]
- **8008**: Oh, I-I'm sorry. Of course, you wouldn't be interested in stars... Goodbye!
- **8009**: I knew you'd be interested! This map was drawn by the famous Windurstian astronomer, Professor Lago-Charago!
- **8010**: See that constellation to the south? That's Bastok's guardian, Titan! But not many people know that now. It's been a long time since we've celebrated Titan's Eve.
- **8011**: The yellow star at its center is Daemdalus, or "Titan's left foot." It used to be a lot brighter in the old days, and soldiers returning from battle followed it back to Bastok.
- **8012**: I'm glad to have met someone else who likes looking at the stars. Maybe we can talk about them more sometime.
- **10683**: <Player>'s badge flashes brightly.
- **10689**: I'm sure that everywhere stars can be seen gleaming in the night sky, there are legends related to them.
- **10690**: I wonder what kind of stories are told in faraway lands...
