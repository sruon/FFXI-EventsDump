## String References

- **7502**: Yes, what is it you want with the Department of Industry? We're very busy, you know. But we wouldn't be if the big boss wasn't such an ignorant amateur.
- **7751**: Yes, what is it? Ah, you are the envoy from [San d'Oria/Windurst].
- **7752**: Go speak to a Galka named Grohm--he was part of the expedition that tried to reclaim the Palborough Mines from the Quadav once before. He should be in the Craftsmen's Eatery in the Metalworks.
- **7753**: Why are you still here? The Musketeers are usually charged with giving out missions, and frankly, I find this kind of work tedious...
- **7754**: But since you are an envoy, you are under my jurisdiction. Still, I can't help but wonder what you [San d'Orians/Windurstians]' true motives are...
- **7755**: Then again, you're going willingly into that Quadav-ridden place, so I can't complain, even if you do turn out to be a spy.
- **7756**: Well, anyway... You want to speak to Grohm, in the Metalworks eatery. Good luck to you.
- **7757**: Oh, and when you're done with your investigation, report directly to your consulate. That is our protocol. I would be rather annoyed if you were to come back here.
