## String References

- **8126**: Hey, you're an adventurer, aren't you? I have this idea... I was thinking of providing tours of the surrounding areas to fledgling adventurers.
- **8127**: You know, if you show them really interesting sights, it'd make them want to go out and see more, right?
- **8128**: Of course, it won't be free once it gets going, but for now, I'm looking for volunteers to try it out and tell me what they think! No charge!
- **8129**: You wanna try? You'll have to be in a party where all members are level fifteen or less.
- **8130**: My partner, Hunting Bear, is waiting near Drachenfall in North Gustaberg. It's on the road that goes from North Gustaberg to Konschtat.
- **8131**: Meet up with him after you form a party that meets my requirements, and he'll pay you for taking part in the test.
- **8132**: Hmm... I guess starting a new kind of business is harder than I thought...
