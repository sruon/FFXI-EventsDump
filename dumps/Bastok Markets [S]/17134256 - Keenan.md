## String References

- **13670**: Greetings! Your tireless efforts on behalf of the Allied Forces are well known in these parts!
- **13671**: What a coincidence that you stopped by. As a matter of fact, I have an offer that might prove interesting for you.
- **13672**: I'm not allowed to reveal my sources, but let it suffice to say that a substantial treasure hoard has been unearthed!
- **13673**: The area in which this treasure was found was one recently annexed to our territory thanks in no small part to your valiant efforts, so I simply had to let you in on the news.
- **13674**: There is one small catch, however. Word has it that a frightening monster has staked out the surrounding environs as its lair, and laid claim to the riches within.
- **13675**: Ordinarily a reclusive beast, it has been sighted only on the rarest of occasions. In an odd coincidence, each of the search parties that encountered it happened to be carrying a $3 at the time...
- **13676**: Curious, is it not? Yet, as the rumor has spread, many brave souls are trying to get their hands on these $5, in the hope that they might draw out and slay the beast, and dispossess it of its treasure.
- **13677**: Where can you get your hands on one, you ask? Ohoho... What would you say if I told you that I just happen to have one with me right here?
- **13678**: I procured it from my...sources, just for you! After all, you have as much claim to the riches as any of those would-be treasure hunters.
- **13679**: Mind you, these aren't easy to come by. If we didn't swear allegiance to the same nation, I'd have to charge a fee of $1 Allied Notes, but...
- **13680**: Seeing as you're such a staunch ally to our cause, I'd be willing to let it go for only $0. Do we have a deal?
- **13681**: Deal? (You currently possess $2 A.N.) [Deal./No thanks.]
- **13682**: Really proceed with the transaction? [Yes./On second thought...]
- **13683**: That's a shame. Well, if you change your mind, I suggest you come back quickly. Now that our forces occupy the area, there's no telling when the beast might move on to greener pastures...
- **13684**: Wonderful! You won't regret it. With this, the treasure is as good as yours!
- **13685**: I'm afraid you haven't enough Allied Notes...
- **13686**: I'd appreciate if you could share this news with your comrades as well. A chance like this doesn't come every day, you know, and word has it there's more than enough treasure to go around.
- **13687**: The monster lurks within the region recently brought under [San d'Orian/Bastokan/Windurstian] control. Make haste, and may the Goddess protect you!
- **13688**: Oh, it's you again! Let me guess. You've come back for the $3. Am I right or am I right?
- **13689**: How about it? [Right you are./Actually, no...]
- **13690**: Yes? I'm afraid I have no time at the moment. Come back later, and we'll talk.
