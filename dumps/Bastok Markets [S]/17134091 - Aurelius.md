## String References

- **12047**: Fourth Legion, Seventh Cohors... Ah, here we are. <Player>, right? Legion Engineer Aurelius at your service.
- **12048**: The centurion has given me orders to assist all legionnaires in understanding the inner-workings of the Allied Campaign.
- **12049**: What can I help you with today? [What is the Allied Campaign?/What are campaign operations?/What are freelances?/Nothing.]
- **12050**: The Allied Campaign is the comprehensive name given to the various operations carried out by the Forces of Altana against the Beastman Confederate.
- **12051**: "Article 1: Dominion is granted the nation that provides the largest contribution in regaining control of an area occupied by the beastmen."
- **12052**: "Article 2: In exchange for the renouncing of all claims to lands seized by their army, campaign arbitration has been bestowed upon the Grand Duchy of Jeuno."
- **12053**: The leaders of Jeuno were first to recognize that it would be difficult for the nations of Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria to cast aside all past differences and join hands on the battlefield.
- **12054**: And that's why the Duchy felt it necessary to motivate the armies by offering rewards for their valor. In other words, we can still compete against those dogs in San d'Oria even though we have to fight alongside them.
- **12055**: As you know, our nation's wealth lies in the natural resources that lie beneath the arid plains of Gustaberg. However, by taking advantage of Article 1 of the Allied Campaign charter, Bastok can lay claim to the fertile lands to the north, thus bolstering our economy even further!
- **12056**: As a provisionary member of the Fighting Fourth, you will be required to participate in various campaign missions and operations to help ensure the prosperity of the Republic.
- **12057**: Campaign operations, also known as Campaign Ops, is the term used for the long list of small-scale missions authorized by the Allied War Council in Jeuno.
- **12058**: When an operation is successfully completed, the nation is rewarded with an increase in battle funding, paid for by the Repositorium--an international bank founded by the four nations of Mindartia and Quon, and located in Jeuno.
- **12059**: To put it bluntly, the harder you work, the richer the Republic becomes.
- **12060**: Now don't get the wrong idea. That money is for the Republican Legion, not for you to spend at the local pub. No, you'll be rewarded with Allied Notes, which can be used to purchase supplies and equipment. You'll also be allowed to participate in more sensitive operations.
- **12061**: Now unless you have any more questions, you are to report to First Centurion Hieronymus on my left.
- **12062**: He will assist you in applying for an operation. Good luck, <Player>.
- **12069**: Freelances is the collective term given to rogue commandos who have not pledged allegiance to any nation.
- **12070**: These groups do not fall under control of the Allied Forces, and only fight when and where they feel like it. Heroes for hire, you could say.
- **12071**: However, many of them are proven fighters, and that is something an army can never have too many of.
- **12072**: If you ever come across one of these freelances, see if you can't convince them to lend their swords to a just cause. The worse they can do is say no, right?
- **12073**: Might you be thinking about joining the Republican Legion? If that's the case, then go speak with Centurion Adelbrecht. He'll assist you.
- **12074**: You're not a member of the Republican Legion, are you? If you're thinking about signing up, then you'll first have to pledge allegiance to Bastok. Speak with Centurion Fridolin for assistance.
