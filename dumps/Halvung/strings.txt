 6753: My magic is almost gone.
 6754: My magical reserves are running low.
 6755: Nooo... I'm almost out of magic...
 6756: Magic? I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel here...
 6757: My magical reserves are nearing depletion.
 6758: I'm almost out of magic.
 6759: Almost out of magic!
 6760: My magic is running low.
 6761: Where'd all my magic go!?
 6762: My magical reserves are running low.
 6763: My magic will no longer be of much aid. Stay sharp!
 6764: My magic...it's all gone!

 6766: I've just recently gained a level. There's still a lot of work to be done until the next one.
 6767: I've just gained a level. I'm itching to get out and test my newfound strength!
 6768: Take it easy. I've just gained a level.
 6769: I have recently risen in level. The next level is still quite some distance away.
 6770: I've just leveled up, but with your help, it'll take no time at all to get to the next level!
 6771: Hey, I just leveled up, didn't I? Easy on the expectations there, partner.
 6772: Since I have just gained a level, it will be quite some time until I reach the next. Sorry to disappoint you, [sir/milady].
 6773: I've just gained a level. The next level is still quite a way off.
 6774: I just gained a level! You can't expect me to level again any time soon!
 6775: Little time has passed since I last gained a level. The next level is still some distance away.
 6776: I've just gained a level, I know. But I still can't wait until I go up again!
 6777: I have recently risen in level. The next level is still quite some distance away.
 6778: I just leveled up! We'll have to do something about your memory problem.
 6779: It's so farrr away...

 6783: Not even close... I still have much experience to gain.
 6784: There is still much work to be done. I must gain more experience if I am to become stronger.
 6785: I still have to gain lots more experience, but I'll do my best!
 6786: My next level is still ages away. Why hurry? Don't worry, be happy!
 6787: I have made some progress, but the next level still eludes me.
 6788: Not even close... I still have much experience to gain.
 6789: I have lots of work to do! I need more experience if I'm gonna get stronger!
 6790: I still have much to do. I must gain more experience in order to grow stronger.
 6791: Ho-hum. Still lots of work to do until my next level!
 6792: There is still much work to be done. I must gain more experience if I am to become stronger.
 6793: My level won't rise if we stand around talking like this!
 6794: No, don't rrremind me! Such a long way to go...
 6795: [/I've gained a fair amount of experience./I think I must be almost halfway to my next level./Hmm./I believe I've almost reached the halfway point to my next level./I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level./I think I must be almost halfway to my next level./I've come a long way towards my next level./We've been busy, huh?/I believe I've almost reached the halfway point to my next level.] [/I must be close to halfway to my next level by now./Can't slow down now!/I must be almost halfway to my next level by now./Let's not rest on our laurels, however!/That was much faster than I expected./No time to be slacking off!/Must be close to halfway by now./I think I'm almost halfway to my next level./Let's not rest on our laurels, however!]
 6796: I've gained a fair amount of experience. I must be close to halfway to my next level by now.
 6797: I think I must be almost halfway to my next level. Can't slow down now!
 6798: Hmm. I must be almost halfway to my next level by now.
 6799: I believe I've almost reached the halfway point to my next level. Let's not rest on our laurels, however!
 6800: I think I'm about half way there...
 6801: I'm half way there, so let's keep up the pace!
 6802: Through sustained effort and your invaluable assistance, I believe I now stand at the halfway point.
 6803: I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level. That was much faster than I expected.
 6804: I think I must be almost halfway to my next level. No time to be slacking off!
 6805: I've come a long way towards my next level. Must be close to halfway by now.
 6806: We've been busy, huh? I think I'm almost halfway to my next level.
 6807: I believe I've almost reached the halfway point to my next level. Let's not rest on our laurels, however!
 6808: I still haven't acquired enough experience. About double what I have now should be sufficient for the next level.
 6809: I'm halfway there...maybe?

 6812: This is a good pace! Not much more to my next level!
 6813: Hmm. Still need a little more experience for my next level.
 6814: Well, well. It appears my next level is not far off at all.
 6815: I'm slowly getting closer to the next level.
 6816: I reckon I'm fairly close to the next level.
 6817: My next level is now visible on the horizon.
 6818: Just a little more. My next level is not too far away.
 6819: Come on! I need to gain a little more experience for my next level!
 6820: I'm past the halfway point. Not long now until I gain another level.
 6821: Just a little more! My next level is almost within sight!
 6822: Well, well. It appears my next level is not far off at all.
 6823: My next level draws ever nearer. But that doesn't mean you can slack off.
 6824: It can't be so far off, now...can it?
 6825: [/Hmm./I'm almost there./Not long now./Any time now./Well, what do you know?/Woohoo!/This is encouraging./I love this time!/Any time now.] [/I should be gaining a level soon./I can almost taste my next level!/My next level is just around the corner./My next level is very close, indeed./I think I'll be gaining a level soon./I'll be leveling up really soon!/I should be gaining a level any time now./I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!/My next level is very close, indeed.]
 6826: Hmm. I should be gaining a level soon.
 6827: I'm almost there! I can almost taste my next level!
 6828: Not long now. My next level is just around the corner.
 6829: Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
 6830: I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
 6831: Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
 6832: Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
 6833: Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
 6834: Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
 6835: This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
 6836: I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
 6837: Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
 6838: My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
 6839: <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
 6840: I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
 6841: It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
 6842: ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
 6843: It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
 6844: Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
 6845: You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
 6846: You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
 6847: I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
 6848: Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
 6849: I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
 6850: Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
 6851: It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
 6852: There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
 6853: She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee.t The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!t
 6854: Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
 6855: Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
 6856: No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
 6857: Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
 6858: ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
 6859: Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
 6860: While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
 6861: It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
 6862: Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
 6863: I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
 6864: Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
 6865: Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
 6866: If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
 6867: Heal the worrrld.t Make it a better place.t For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.t
 6868: Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
 6869: You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
 6870: ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
 6871: A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
 6872: Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
 6873: You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
 6874: Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
 6875: By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
 6876: Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
 6877: By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
 6878: You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
 6879: A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
 6880: Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
 6881: Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...
 6882: [/Ready?/Keep your eyes open!/I see an opening./Are you ready?/I'm warmed up now./Don't blink now!/Are you ready?/Alrighty!/Are you ready?] [/I'm taking my shot!/You don't wanna miss this!/Get ready to follow up./I'm beginning my attack!/Time for a real attack!/Follow my lead!/I'm taking my shot!/Here goes nothing!/I'm beginning my attack!]

 6911: Defeated enemies? That was number $0.
 6912: So far, we've only taken down $0 [enemy/enemies] today!
 6913: How many enemies have we defeated? Only $0. You can count that high, right...?
 6914: You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? Why, we have only vanquished $0 [foe/foes] so far.
 6915: We haven't defeated many enemies yet. Only $0 so far.
 6916: We've only defeated $0 [enemy/enemies] so far. Nothing to write home about.
 6917: Our progress, [sir/milady]? The last foe bested brings today's tally to $0 [enemy/enemies].
 6918: We've only beaten $0 [enemy/enemies] so far. Don't tell me you're tired already!?
 6919: Only $0 [enemy has/enemies have] fallen to us today! We're just getting started!
 6920: The last enemy we defeated was number $0.
 6921: The last enemy we took down was number $0.
 6922: You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? Why, we have only vanquished $0 [foe/foes] so far.
 6923: Only $0 [enemy/enemies] defeated so far. This doesn't even amount to a warm-up.
 6924: We've beaten at least two...right?
 6925: Defeated enemies? That was number $0.
 6926: I'd say we've blasted through around $0 [enemy/enemies] by now!
 6927: How many enemies have we defeated? Hmm, around $0...
 6928: You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? The last villain we defeated brings us to number $0.
 6929: You want to know how many enemies we've beaten so far? Let me check... It's $0.
 6930: The last one we took care of makes number $0, right? Not too shabby, if I do say so myself.
 6931: Our progress, [sir/milady]? The last foe bested brings today's tally to $0 [enemy/enemies].
 6932: We've defeated about $0 [enemy/enemies] now. That should quieten things down around here!
 6933: I would say we've taken out around $0 [enemy/enemies] by now. Still more work to be done!
 6934: The last enemy we defeated was number $0. As far as I remember.
 6935: How many enemies have we downed? Umm...around $0. I think.
 6936: You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? The last villain we defeated brings us to number $0.
 6937: Our tally stands at a meager $0 enemies. This is unacceptable. We're picking up the pace!
 6938: We've beaten a lot more than three now...prrrobably.
 6939: Defeated enemies? That was number $0, I believe.
 6940: I'm just guessing here, but I'd say we've destroyed about $0 [enemy/enemies] today!
 6941: Enemies defeated? I wasn't really keeping track. Around $0, I suppose...
 6942: You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to $0.
 6943: How many enemies we've defeated? Isn't it something like $0?
 6944: Let's see... So far we've wiped the floor with $0 enemies. Good job!
 6945: The last foe bested brings today's tally to $0 [enemy/enemies]--a most impressive figure. Shall I prepare tea and biscuits?
 6946: We just beat enemy number $0. They just keep coming, don't they?
 6947: The last enemy we took down was number $0...I think.
 6948: That last enemy brings us to a total of $0 [enemy/enemies] defeated. We've been busy.
 6949: Umm, let's see here... We've beaten $0 [enemy/enemies] today, right? I've totally lost count...
 6950: You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to $0.
 6951: We've already rid the land of $0 enemies today, but it doesn't seem to make even the slightest dint in their numbers.

 7259: Test switch on!
 7260: I don't want to be locked up in this funny-looking jar forrrever! Please get me out of here!
 7261: It's so hot in here. I can't stand it any longer... Please get me out of here before I drrry up like a date!
 7262: This place is so dank and gloomy and deprrressing... Please get me out of here!
 7263: I owe you one! I better get back now before the weapons in my shop rrrust away to nothing!
 7264: You're the [man/woman] who saved me! You rrreally got me out of a tight spot. Here, this is on the house!
 7265: Step rrright up to Kahah Hobichai's Blades! We've got everything your battle-thirrrsty heart desires!
 7266: They can't keep me cooped up in here! This is a violation of shopkeepers' rights! They think armor merchants can't fight, eh!?
 7267: They can't keep me cooped up in here! It feels like someone's left the furnace on for three years! I've got places to go, people to see!
 7268: They can't keep me cooped up in here! I'm lucky I equipped some of my shop's goods... This place is so cold and creepy.
 7269: I owe you one! I'm sure my fans are waiting for me, so I had better get back before they do something drastic!
 7270: Heeey, I recognize you. I owe my success to you! Here, you've earned this!
 7271: Hey, how ya doin'? Welcome to the armor shop of the Ulthalam Parade's leading star--Allard, in the flesh!
 7272: A-another person...? Please help me! I can't stand this place...too many scales...icky...
 7273: A-another person? Please help me! I can't stand this place...too hot...I've always preferred cold weather...
 7274: A-another person? Please help me! I can't stand this place...too much sea...I'm more of a mountain person...
 7275: Thank you! I run a shop that sells magic scrolls...but I can't use magic... Drop by if you're ever in the area.
 7276: Oh! I-it's you! Oh my, how should I thank you? I don't know what kind of things you like... Ah, I know... Here, take this.
 7277: Welcome... I'm Zafif, and this is my magic shop... I hope you can find something of use here.
 7278: Ohhh... My little legs are so waky-shaky I can't even move them!
 7279: Ohhh... My tummy is wumble-grumbling!
 7280: Ohhh... My legs are asleep! I can't even wove-move. What'll I do?
 7281: Free! Freeee! Now I can go back to my shop! Thank you!
 7282: Oh, I remember you! Here, I wound-found this in the middle drawer. Here you go, now! It's yours!
 7283: Chayaya's Projectiles! Get your darts and more at Chayaya's Projectiles! Just don't touch the stuff in the high drawers, okay?
 7284: Well now, I wonder where this is. I hope my chocobos are somehow getting along without me.
 7285: I wonder how my chocobos will fare while I am locked up here...
 7286: I wonder how much time has passed since I was captured. I am quite worried about my chocobos...
 7287: You have my utmost gratitude. I must return to town and feed my chocobos before they grow hungry.
 7288: You are the adventurer who saved me, are you not? I have been waiting to meet again so I could give you this.
 7289: The Chocobo Stables are currently not open. Please come back later.
 7290: Please save poooor Chochoroon, okay? Nothing to dooo in croood jar.
 7291: Please save poooor Chochoroon, okay? Nothing to dooo in sooooty cage.
 7292: Please save poooor Chochoroon, okay? Nothing to dooo behind spoooky bars.
 7293: Nice, nice adventoorer! Thank yooo! Now Chochoroon can return to appraising mysteriooos item, okay?
 7294: Nice adventooorer save Chochoroon, yes? Chochoroon very happy. Chochoroon give yooo present.
 7295: This place gives me the creeps. I should've practiced using teleportation magic on myself!
 7296: This place is going to make me melt into a puddle. I bet if you were stuck in here, you could use magic and make a grand escape, but me...
 7297: This place is going to freeze me into a block of sub-zero gelato. I bet you could warm yourself up with fire magic, but me...
 7298: I don't know who you are, but you're the nicest person I ever met! Thank you!
 7299: You saved me earlier! Thank you very much! You can have this...for free!
 7300: As I was being dragged to this dreadful place, I noticed many questionable decorations about the area. I wonder if those are a type of charm against evil...
 7301: As I sit in this cage and reflect, I feel the "true darkness" creeping ever closer... I must return to town at once.
 7302: There's something foul in the air here. Can you not feel it? The "true darkness" is approaching.
 7303: I give you my thanks, adventurer. I must now make haste back to town, where I can help ward off the darkness. We shall meet again.
 7304: You saved me from my shadowy prison. Thank you. I have no wards against the darkness now, so I am afraid you must settle with this.
 7305: This is terrible... How will the auction house in Al Zahbi ever function without me?
 7306: This is awful... Who will take care of the auction house while I'm gone?
 7307: This is horrible... I've still got the keys to the auction house in my pocket! Noone'll be able to get in without them!
 7308: Thank you! Now I can go back to town and reopen the auction house!
 7309: I was beginning to think the auction house was going to have to shut down for good...until you saved me. Please accept my thanks.
 7310: This auction house is renowned for its low transaction fees, and the fact that it's connected to Jeuno makes it extremely convenient!
 7311: I was sure I could overpower the beastmen, but they were just too strong... I must strive harder if I am to face my followers again.
 7312: I was planning to build my strength from morning until night...but all my power turned out to be useless when I really needed it.
 7313: You've fought the beastmen so many times they don't even make a scratch on you now, right?
 7314: Thank you. I've realized now that I must train the mind as well as the body. I must return and share this revelation!
 7315: Thank you for freeing me earlier. I have decided to train both my body and mind from now on. Please accept this as gratitude.
 7316: See how hard my students are working? It brings me great pleasure each day to see how much they are growing under my guidance.
 7317: I would be devastated if anything were to happen to Her Magnificence while I was confined! You must help me!
 7318: The Serpent Generals are under my guidance, and all I can do is wile away the days as Her Magnificence remains unguarded!
 7319: Who will protect the Empress while I am wiling away in this prison? Even perishing here would not absolve me if she is hurt!
 7320: Praise be to you! I shall return now and ensure the Empress's safety. May she reign a thousand years!
 7321: Her Magnificence the Empress is safely shielded now, and it is all thanks to your efforts. You have the makings of a hero.
 7322: The mercenaries and the Imperial Army shall fight and perish as one to shield the Empress from harm!
 7323: May Her Magnificence reign a thousand years!
 7324: My presence was all for naught... My failure to protect the Astral Candescence is a transgression worthy of a thousand deaths...
 7325: Hear my plea... You mercenaries may be all that I can trust. Recover the Astral Candescence and bring it safely back to Al Zahbi...I implore you!
 7326: Ah, [/Private Second Class /Private First Class /Superior Private /Lance Corporal /Corporal /Sergeant /Sergeant Major /Chief Sergeant /Second Lieutenant /First Lieutenant /Captain ]<Player>! It is reassuring indeed to have such a mighty ally to aid in the defense of Al Zahbi.
 7327: I am honored to fight at your side in the name of Her Magnificence!
 7328: Foul lizards, I damn you! Go ahead and bask in your victory. It shall be your last!
 7329: Damn you foolish Trolls! When I get out of here, I shall bathe your dwellings in scarlet!
 7330: You are not undead, are you? Release me from this prison now! I shall make ashes from those witches!
 7331: ... I shall not praise you for fulfilling your duty. I will take your name, though.
 7332: <Player>, is it? This should please you...
 7333: You are a mercenary, are you?
 7334: Hmph, filthy money-grubbers. Those who are controlled by money are eventually betrayed by it.
 7335: Damn those spineless Imperial soldiers! How could they let the Astral Candescence slip out right under their very noses!?
 7336: ...Hm? You! Yes, you! What do you think you're staring at, anyway? Go get the Astral Candescence back, and now!
 7337: Ugh, you again. I have no patience for the mercenary mentality.
 7338: But you do show some skill in battle. I'll give you that much, <Player>...
 7339: I'm going to be stuck in here forrrever... I'll never get out like this...
 7340: What if they'rrre planning to drag me off to the headsman? I...I'm scared...
 7341: My knees start to wobble at the mere thought of those eerrrie fish people... I can't even move...
 7342: What do you want? I was just about to bust out of there myself!
 7343: Oh, I rrremember you. Here, this is for you.
 7344: I-I'm not thanking you for anything. Don't get the wrrrong idea. This is just to cover the costs of your journey.
 7345: Leave me alone. I can't stand merrrcenaries.
 7346: Just make sure you don't get in our way when we're rrripping up the battlefield.
 7347: How am I going to get out of this...? The...the...Astral Candescence... What'll I tell the Empress...?
 7348: ...What!? I don't need you merrrcenaries' help. I could take the Astral Candescence back with both hands tied behind my back!
 7349: Hmph, just because you think you know a thing or two about me now doesn't mean I like you.
 7350: I am a generrral. You are a mercenary. Rrremember your station.
 7351: Hey, lizard people! I'm going to start breaking things if I don't get some food in here soon!
 7352: Damn, it's hot in here... Hey, pipsqueak! Yes, you! Get me out of here before I dry up like a date!
 7353: I've still got life in my bones! Unlike you mindless corpses, I need sustenance to keep moving!
 7354: Gahahaha! You were a living person after all! I can't believe that of all people, a mercenary saved my hide!
 7355: Hey, you're the [man/woman] who braved the beastmen to save me earlier, aren't you? Thank you! This is for you.
 7356: When the beastmen invade, make sure you get behind us while we decimate the enemy. We wouldn't want you getting hurt now, would we?
 7357: Gahahaha!
 7358: Damn, we lost bad, didn't we? They even managed to take the Astral Candescence... But it's times like these...
 7359: Gahahaha! ...that we should laugh in the face of fate and take back what's ours!
 7360: Oho, it's you! This battle will be over in time for lunch, then. I hate to miss a meal!
 7361: Gahahaha!
 7362: That scent... You are a person, are you not? I am Najelith of the Galeserpent. I bid you, release me from this prison!
 7363: Those footsteps... You are a person, are you not? I am Najelith of the Galeserpent. I bid you, release me from this prison!
 7364: The sound of breathing... You are a living being, are you not? I am Najelith of the Galeserpent. I bid you, release me from this prison!
 7365: Many thanks. I am Najelith of the Galeserpent--one of the five Serpent Generals. I owe my escape to you.
 7366: Thanks to your heroic rescue, I was able to safely return to my post. I would like to show you my gratitude with this gift.
 7367: We Serpent Generals will defend Al Zahbi with our lives.
 7368: The mercenaries also have an important role in protecting the Empire. Do not forget that.

 7864: What do you wish to know about? [Nothing./Sanction./Imperial Standing./Besieged.]
 7865: What about Besieged? [Never mind./Besieged basics./"Serpent Generals."/Astral Candescence in Al Zahbi./Astral Candescence with beastmen./Empire's current state of defense.]
 7866: "Sanction" is a magic spell that we use to observe and assess mercenaries' actions.
 7867: Defeating enemies while you have Sanction cast on you will raise your Imperial Standing. Also, the stronger the monsters you fight, the higher your Imperial Standing will become.
 7868: When fighting in a beastman stronghold that has taken the Astral Candescence, your Imperial Standing will rise by a significant amount as thanks for your participation in the recovery effort.
 7869: Sanction is also necessary in order to receive crystals from the enemies you defeat.
 7870: But you must take caution. Stepping too far out of the Empire's boundaries will cause Sanction to wear off.
 7871: You can raise your Imperial Standing by defeating enemies while you have Sanction cast on you.
 7872: Saving a captured prisoner in a beastman stronghold and submitting archaic mirrors to Imperial guards will also result in an increased Imperial Standing.
 7873: You can view your Imperial Standing by selecting "Besieged" under "Region Info."
 7874: You can also speak to me at any time to exchange your Imperial Standing credits for items.
 7875: "Besieged" occurs when the beastman armies breach the walls of Al Zahbi.
 7876: Everyone in town who is capable of wielding a weapon is called to action to defend Al Zahbi alongside the Imperial Army.
 7877: The beastmen's main purpose is to enter the Hall of Binding and wrest the "Astral Candescence" from the Empire's control.
 7878: You need not know what the Astral Candescence is.
 7879: All you must know is that it is your duty to protect the five Serpent Generals who hold the keys to the Hall of Binding, and to drive the beastman hordes from the Imperial capital.
 7880: The Empire's safety and its future rest on your capable shoulders! Rest assured that you will be rewarded for your efforts.
 7881: The Empire's defense is entrusted to five generals.
 7882: Each possesses a name corresponding to the symbols of the Empire--the serpents of flame, water, stone, gales, and sky.
 7883: Furthermore, the mirrors used to open the Hall of Binding are divided among their possession. Thus, the generals' fates determine the tide of battle.
 7884: If all five generals should fall in battle, the Hall of Binding will open, and the beastmen will be able to seize the Astral Candescence.
 7885: It is your responsibility to prevent such a disaster from happening. We are depending on you!
 7886: When the Astral Candescence is safely resting on its plinth in the Hall of Binding, it emanates waves that bestow special bonuses to Sanction.
 7887: The first bonus is a slight boost to the amount of experience points received from battles. You will receive this effect simply by having Sanction cast on you.
 7888: There are several other bonus effects, but you must sacrifice some of your Imperial Standing credits in order to receive them.
 7889: Keep in mind that the bonuses become more powerful with the number of times the Imperial capital is successfully defended.
 7890: Sanction's strength will reset if the beastmen succeed in invading the Hall of Binding, though.
 7891: The waves emanating from the Astral Candescence in Al Zahbi bring a multitude of blessings to all of us. You must not let it fall into the hands of the beastmen!
 7892: If the beastmen manage to take the Astral Candescence, its recovery will become our top priority. Find the coveted item on a plinth in one of the beastman strongholds and seize it back for the Empire!
 7893: We aren't quite sure what the beastmen are scheming to do with such power, but we do know that the Astral Candescence's waves can increase the beastmen's strength.
 7894: As if that weren't enough, we have recent reports that the beastmen have set "archaic mirrors" in their strongholds to magnify the power of the waves.
 7895: If you should come across any archaic mirrors, take them immediately and trade them to an Imperial guard.
 7896: Al Zahbi has been successively victorious in $4 [battle/battles] to defend the capital, bringing the Imperial defense to a value of $5. The Imperial capital has seen $6 [victory/victories] overall, and the Astral Candescence has been seized by the beastmen a total of $7 [time/times].
 7897: You do not possess the $1 [Imperial Standing credit/Imperial Standing credits] required to fully recharge the $0.
 7898: Please be aware that you can only recharge $0 once during the period between each Conquest tally.
 7899: The $0 is already fully charged.
 7900: Your $0 has received $2 [charge/charges] in exchange for $1 [Imperial Standing credit/Imperial Standing credits]. It is now fully recharged.
 7901: Your Imperial Standing has increased by $0 credits!

 7910: You rap on the gate using the pattern you see on the two musical scores. After a time, you hear the creaking sound of a heavy bar being lifted on the other side of the gate...

 7937: I travel all over the world and hear lots of differererent stories. I even hear your stories. I can tell you one, if you want.
 7938: Now, listen close...

 8001: Nothing happens...
 8002: Are you ready for a spine-chilling, stomach-churning test of your mettle, kupo!?
 8003: We've set up a secret marker somewhere in the bowels of a dreadful dungeon. Your goal is to reach that marker alive, kupo!
 8004: Oh, a new adventurer! Best of luck, kupo!
 8005: Are you helping out the new adventurers? Best of luck in your endeavors, kupo!
 8006: You're not wearing your yukata! Put it on and show me how it looks, kupo!
 8007: Here's your reward for reaching the goal, kupo!
 8008: Wear the yukata the next time you come to see me! I can't wait to see how you look, kupo!
 8009: Partner up with lots of different adventurers and bring back all kinds of trophies to prove your courage! When you've brought enough, I'll give you something really special, kupo!
 8010: The face in the portrait you brought me is just... Kupupupu!
 8011: Incredible, kupo! You must have nerves of darksteel! Here, you've earned this, kupo!
 8012: You took another dive into the dreaded dungeon, kupo? Well, you deserve a little something for your preternatural perseverance, kupo.
 8013: You haven't earned my really special present yet! Only truly dauntless dungeon-delvers get that, kupo!
 8014: This isn't enough to prove you reached the goal as a dungeon-delving duo. You have to bring me the item your partner received to show that you were both successful, kupo!
 8015: To go on this fright-filled face-off with fear, you need a partner who can prove you reached the goal. Come back when you have a buddy in bravery, kupo!
 8016: This adventure into adversity is only available to two-person parties. Split up into pairs and talk to me again, kupo!
 8017: Please come back with a different partner. It'll be no fun to scare you if your reactions are too similar, kupo!

 8019: Your partner must talk to me as well. I'll be waiting for you whenever you're ready, kupo.
 8020: You can only choose one partner a day. Come back again tomorrow, kupo!
 8021: Hold up there! It looks like your candidate for courageous companionship has already got a partner! You can't choose that person at the moment, kupo!

 8024: Are you ready to go? [Ready, kupo!/I'm too terrified, kupo!]
 8025: I'll be checking to see if you reached the goal. You can use this magical scroll to make a speedy return to town, kupo.
 8026: If you both succeed, I'll have a prize waiting for you! Now, off you go, kupo!
 8027: You can only carry one $0.
 8028: Are you participating in this petrifying pilgrimage with the person in your present party?
 8029: Hey, you changed partners! You can't switch halfway through, kupo!
 8030: Wait, the number of people in your party has changed! You have to be in a two-person party, kupo!
 8031: Choose your partner wisely. Come back when you think you have a winning combo, kupo!
 8032: Boo-hah-hah`...kupo!
 8033: Huh? Why aren't you jumping out of your skin in absolute terror? I would've died of fright, kupo!
 8034: Here, take this as a testament to your courage. Exchange it for the item your partner received so you can prove that you both reached the goal safely, kupo!
 8035: Return with the evidence of your success to the moogle in town. Handing over your partner's item will prove that you were both able to reach me, kupo!
 8036: Oh, and here's a picture of how your partner's face looked when I popped out of nowhere to scare you. You should hand this in at the same time, kupo! Kupupupu...
 8037: This place is crawling with nasties. You should probably head back to town so you can testify to your partner's bravery.
 8038: Why do ghosts say "boo," anyway?
 8039: I heard that going to a dark, scary dungeon is the best way to test your courage. This place definitely qualifies, kupo!
 8040: Maybe I'm doing something wrong, kupo?
 8041: If it gets out that I haven't scared the wits out of a single person yet, I'm going to get into trouble, kupo...
