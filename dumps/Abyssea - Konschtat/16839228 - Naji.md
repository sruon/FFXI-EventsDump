## String References

- **7887**: You hand over $3.
- **7999**: Our foe is ever adapting. Yesterday's information will serve you as well as the grime on your bootstraps. Bring us fresh recon data, and you shall be rewarded for your efforts.
- **8010**: (You there! Yeah, you! Think you could be any more blunderingly obvious?)
- **8011**: (Maybe you could put up a big sign, saying "Hey monsters! Free meal this way!"! Then again, that might actually be more subtle. Now get back to camp before you get us both killed!)
- **8012**: (You there! Don't you know it's dangerous to be blundering about out in the open? Get over here! Quickly, now!)
- **8013**: I swear, you careless new recruits are a bigger threat to us than the hordes! What are you doing in a place like this, anyway?
- **8014**: I wouldn't even be here myself if the damned fiends hadn't got my leg. After I got separated from Helga, I thought to make it back to camp by the eastern route, and gather some fresh recon along the way.
- **8015**: And let me tell you, was I ever on the trail of the big one. Then one of those cursed quakes struck and the ledge I thought I was standing on wasn't there anymore.
- **8016**: What's that? Helga sent you looking for me? Sheesh. You'd think a captain of the resistance would have better things to worry about...
- **8017**: I've got it. Why don't you tell her I kicked the bucket? Splat! Smothered by an oversized slime. But then, I'll make furtive appearances when people least expect it... In the shadows, or in the dark of night... "Was that Naji?" "It couldn't be!" It'll be like a big mystery!
- **8018**: Ahaha! You could stand to lighten up some, friend. Goddess knows there's little enough to smile about in this blood-soaked, dying world.
- **8019**: But that's enough levity for today. This $0 here is the fruit of my ill-fated recon mission. Deliver it to Helga, along with the news that I'm safe and sound.
- **8020**: My leg? Hah! You think the resistance's top operative is going to go down to a little sprain? Best you worry about yourself, rookie.
- **8021**: Now get moving before you draw the enemy's attention. Quickly now!
- **8030**: (Shhh! You're making more noise than a bevy of bugards!)
- **8031**: You again, rookie? Had so much fun nearly blowing my cover last time that you thought you'd do it again?
- **8032**: Helga sent you, you say? Hah! I save her hide every other Firesday, and she still thinks I need a rookie to babysit me!
- **8033**: Don't look at me like that. I'm not such a fool as to deny that there's truth in what she says. Besides, word has it that you've got some skill with a $0. Am I right?
- **8034**: Well, then maybe I could do worse for a partner. What say you assist me in collecting intelligence on the biggest, baddest fiends in the area?
- **8035**: Mind you, I'm not just talking about your run-of-the-mill notorious foes. I'm talking fearsome brutes of such staggering power that it would take a veritable legion to topple them!
- **8036**: If you don't have a $0 on you, you'll want to head back to camp and pick one up before you set out.
- **8037**: Last I heard, they keep a good stock of them in those lined caskets. Bah. All the equipment in the world won't do you a smidge of good unless you have people who know how to use it, I say.
- **8038**: Anyway. I want you to secure a choice shot of one of those fiends and bring it straight back here to me. Or you could bring it to Helga...if you're not interested in sharing in the spoils I brought back from my latest mission, that is. Heh heh...
- **8039**: All right, rookie. Now get out there and show me what you've got!
- **8040**: That was quick, rookie. Well, what have you got for me?
- **8041**: I thought we were clear. Listen. I need you to gather intelligence on our most imposing threats.
- **8042**: There are frightful monsters that'll scare a rookie resistance officer right out of [his/her] boots. Then we've got fiends so nasty that they'll scare even those other monsters out of their boots! Er, or whatever footwear they prefer. Anyway, those are the ones we need intel on.
- **8043**: I recall seeing a nasty purple thing the size of a small mountain shambling along not too far from here. And this frightful thing with a knife, a ways off to the northeast. Why don't you see if you can track them down?
- **8044**: Got something for me, rookie? Let's see here...
- **8045**: These vivid colors...why, you must have been right under the fiend's nose. You sure you didn't sneak off with one of my prints to try to pass off as one of your own?
- **8046**: You may be a rookie, but you've got talent. And coming from me, that should mean something. I'll report to base command on your findings. Take this...you've earned it!
- **8047**: Hmm, not bad...for a rookie. You've got a long way to go to match my skills, but in the meantime, I think we can work with this.
- **8048**: I'll report your findings back to base command. Here's something for your troubles.
- **8049**: Uh, lovely shot of the local flora and fauna, but where's the frightful fiend in here? What? That little dot in the distance!?
- **8050**: Haha! Good one, rookie! Listen, you're not gonna get anywhere as an intel operative unless you're willing to get up close and personal with those beast. Now get back out there!
- **8051**: What's this? A blank plate?
- **8052**: Uh, you do have to push the button, you know. Rookies these days... Sheesh...
- **8053**: Back for more? I can't fault your eagerness, rookie, but I'm still trying to make something out of the last print you brought for me. Come back in a bit, will ya?
- **8104**: Eh!? Listen... I know you're only a rookie, but my dear departed grandma coulda got me intel on a piddling peon like this.
