## String References

- **7980**: Yes? I've not seen your face before.
- **7981**: I'm afraid we've got our hands full taking care of our own men. For your own safety and ours, you'd best get along on your way.
- **7982**: So you're the one Captain Helga spoke of. The camp's been abuzz with talk of your exploits of late.
- **7983**: I'm glad you've come, for we could use your services as well. If you haven't exhausted your generosity, that is.
- **7984**: We specialize in reconnaissance here. By identifying the movement patterns of our foes before they strike, we can guard against potential ambushes. Heaven knows our regiment can't afford to suffer any more crippling blows.
- **7985**: This is the prized tool of our trade: a pretty little thing we call the $0. Go ahead, hold 'er. She's lighter than she looks, no?
- **7986**: Set 'er up and point her at a target, and you'll get a right fearsome shot of the life energies swirling around in the belly of your beast. It's all quite surreal, really.
- **7987**: These soulprints may not mean much to the layman, but to us, they contain data on our foes that could mean the difference between life and death. Bring me $0, and we'll gladly repay you for your efforts.
- **7988**: Mind you, it's not the rank and file we're investigating here. Only the most powerful foes concern us--those whose strength is impossible to judge with the naked eye.
- **7989**: If you're up to the task, you'll find a spare $0 and $1 in that casket over there. Be careful out there, and good hunting!
- **7990**: Ho there! How go your recon efforts? If you've got any soulprints for us, just hand them over.
- **7991**: There's the [man/woman] I was waiting for! Let's see what you've got for us here...
- **7992**: Such focus! Such clarity! Hm...? The intensity of these soulstrands...! Captain Ayame doesn't know it, but she's got a whopper on her tail...
- **7993**: I must send word at once. My friend, you've no idea how much you've done for us today. Take this. You've more than earned it.
- **7994**: Hmm... The soulstrands are a tad blurred... Just a bit closer, with a head-on angle and we'd be in business. Still, we should be able to glean something from this with a bit of effort.
- **7995**: All in all, not a bad showing for a beginner. Take this for your troubles.
- **7996**: No...I'm afraid this won't do at all. See how dim these soulstrands are? I couldn't tell a ghost from a goobbue with this! You have to get in closer, see...
- **7997**: Sorry, but we'll be needing another sample.
- **7998**: Hm? Is this your idea of a joke? Why, this plate's completely blank!
- **7999**: Our foe is ever adapting. Yesterday's information will serve you as well as the grime on your bootstraps. Bring us fresh recon data, and you shall be rewarded for your efforts.
- **8000**: I'm afraid that we're still in the process of analyzing the last print you brought us. Come back in a bit, won't you?
- **8103**: Hmm... These soulstrands are too faint. I'm afraid this is just a run-of-the-mill fiend. We've no need for intelligence on the rank and file.
