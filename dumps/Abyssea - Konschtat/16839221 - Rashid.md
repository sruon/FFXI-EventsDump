## String References

- **7881**: You there! This is a danger zone! I suggest you get out of here, and quickly!
- **7882**: A stray beam of light catches <Player>'s $3, causing it to gleam for a moment.
- **7883**: That seal... Hm? "Rose on the heath", you say?
- **7884**: Reinforcements? Haha! Well, why didn't you say so, my good--
- **7885**: What's that? You've brought us a linkpearl?
- **7886**: A most heartening turn of events, this. Why, when we lost communication all of a sudden, my men and I feared the worst...
- **7887**: You hand over $3.
- **7888**: We were on patrol here when we got word that the base was under attack from the hordes. With our other two squads such a long ways from home, we thought to make a swift return and aid in the defense. Those fiends had other plans for us, though...
- **7889**: We were ambushed, and barely escaped with our lives. Lost some civilians too, we did...weighs heavy on this soldier's heart.
- **7890**: What we really need is to return to base... But budge even an ilm from this place in our current state, and we'd be sitting slugs. No, it's all we can do to keep the martello operational and tend to our wounded...
- **7891**: Perhaps you could help us. I beg of you. You can see the dire straits we are in.
- **7892**: You see the fellow at work over there by that martello? That's Julio, an alchemist who's taken refuge in our camp. In return for our protection, we've put him to task making basic supplies for us. Talk to him and tell him you've come to help.
- **7893**: We've suffered great losses, and morale is at an all-time low. But your arrival has given us a glimmer of hope, faint as it still may be. Please, friend. We're counting on you.
- **7894**: If you're gonna stick around, get those legs in gear and help us replenish our martello! Stand around loitering, and you'll get us all killed!
- **7938**: Excellent! You're here, and not a moment too soon!
- **7939**: We're in quite a bind, friend. I've got wounded men here, and all our woundpatchers are out afield! You will aid us, won't you?
- **7940**: Offer your aid? [Of course!/I'm a busy [man/woman].]
- **7941**: Oh, thank you, friend! You've no idea how much this means to us.
- **7942**: Five of my men are locked in battle with our foe in the vicinity of this camp. They fight bravely, but I know their wounds are dire.
- **7943**: I would be greatly in your debt if you could deliver $0 to each of them.
- **7944**: If you're in need of $0, Julio over there should be able to furnish you with some.
- **7945**: Just between you and me, I find him to be a smug, self-important blowhard, but his skills are not to be denied.
- **7946**: Now don't delay! My men are counting on you!
- **7947**: You would turn your back on the suffering of... Bah...why am I wasting my breath? Begone! Begone with you!
- **7953**: Excellent! Our regiment is back fighting at full strength, and we have you to thank for it.
- **7954**: It may not be much, but please accept this as a small token of my appreciation. You've served us well, friend!
- **7955**: Ah, you've returned! Come to lend your services again? My men could certainly use a breather...
- **7956**: You're a breath of fresh air on this harsh battlefield, I tell you. We're counting on you!
