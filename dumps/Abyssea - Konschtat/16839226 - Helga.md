## String References

- **7882**: A stray beam of light catches <Player>'s $3, causing it to gleam for a moment.
- **7887**: You hand over $3.
- **7907**: Halt! Who goes there!?
- **7908**: Hah! A forgery, no doubt! You'll have to try harder than that to pull one over on ol' Helga, you despicable, double-crossing Abyssean agent! Oh, yes...we'll see by the blood you bleed when I run you--
- **7909**: "Rose on the heath"...? You fiends know our password now!? Is there no end to the depths of your decep--
- **7910**: A linkpearl...from Captain Ayame? Could it be that you truly are...?
- **7911**: Forgive me for doubting you. As you can imagine, tensions are running high for all of us these days.
- **7912**: We were scouting this area with Captain Naji and his regiment when the fiends fell upon us. So sudden was the onslaught that we were quickly separated from our companions. We were fortunate enough to have a fully fueled martello nearby, else I'd be decomposing in a slime's belly right now instead of talking to you...
- **7913**: ...But what's done is done. What matters now is that we regroup and rejoin the fight as soon as possible. This linkpearl you brought will be of great use to us. We are in your debt.
- **7914**: Ah, the scout from base command. Decided to stay for a bit, did you?
- **7915**: We've not much in the way of hospitality to offer, but we'd certainly welcome your aid. Speak to Cleades. He'll put you to work in quick order.
- **7916**: Halt! Who goes there!?
- **7917**: It would appear that you are not one of them...but how can we be sure? Our enemy grows more devious by the hour. We must remain vigilant!
- **7918**: No! I will tell you nothing! I know not what dark master you serve, but you return and tell him this: the Republic may have fallen, but we Bastokers will fight on! Until the last drop of your foul blood is spilled, we will fight on!
- **7919**: >*11\\E bAD-iFM$10$22L$g"$hF]=$4981301$TE""$5052233p$P11]5D -jH")B
- **8001**: <Player>! Just the [man/woman] I wanted to see. There is something I must discuss with you.
- **8002**: I grow concerned about the safety of my fellow captain, Naji. With our communication lines restored, he should have contacted us by now, but we've heard neither hide nor hair of him.
- **8003**: When last we spoke, he had his trusty Soulgauger in hand. Said he was on a covert operation to gather intel on some particularly frightful quarry. We had barely exchanged a few words when the fiends fell upon us.
- **8004**: By Ayame's word, he hasn't shown in base camp, either. He's something of a lone wolf, but to be out of contact for this long...something's not right.
- **8005**: ...
- **8006**: You've not met him, but believe me when I say that this Naji is one of our best and most capable men. It would not be an overstatement to say that it is his expertise at surveillance and espionage that has kept us alive and fighting to this day.
- **8007**: You must find him, <Player>. The future of the resistance...no, of all our kind depends on it!
- **8008**: You're back! Have you brought news of Naji?
- **8009**: You must find him, <Player>. Our future depends on it!
- **8022**: He's hurt!? Why, we must send a rescue squad at once! Woundpatchers! Is there a woundpatcher in the--
- **8023**: What's that? He's fought through worse, he says? He's camouflaged himself against the rockface? Well, I suppose that if anyone in our ranks can take care of his own hide, it's Naji.
- **8024**: Oh? You've brought his latest reconnaissance data?
- **8025**: Good heavens...! To think such a fiend is so close on our trail!
- **8026**: You have my gratitude, <Player>. Troublemaker as he may be, it seems that once again Naji's intel-gathering skills will save us from a grisly demise.
- **8027**: Still, as his comrade and peer, I simply can't allow the man to play fast and loose with his own life. He may laugh off my concern, but deep down he knows that we all must band together if we wish to survive.
- **8028**: I want you to work with Naji, <Player>. He may scoff at being partnered with a rookie, but he has an eye for talent. He will soon learn to value you, as I have. Now take this.
- **8029**: You may also find this to be of some use to you. Take it as payment for your efforts.
