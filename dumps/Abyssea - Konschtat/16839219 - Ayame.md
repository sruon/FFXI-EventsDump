## String References

- **7840**: You there! We're in need of a few good [men/women]. If you've time to stand about, how about lending your strength to the cause?
- **7841**: Yours is an unfamiliar face. What do they call you?
- **7842**: Pleased to make your acquaintance, <Player>. As I said a moment ago, we could certainly use your aid.
- **7843**: We came under attack from a particularly vicious horde not hours ago, you see. Fortunately, we suffered no casualties, but the searing ward protecting our encampment is on its last legs.
- **7844**: If the ward breaks, you can bet we'll be overrun with fiends in the blink of an eye. We must repair it, and immediately. Raibaht is in charge of maintenance, but we need someone to deliver to him the necessary materials.
- **7845**: The supplies may be found scattered throughout this encampment. Collect them, and make haste! The enemy is ever snapping at our heels.
- **7846**: What are you still doing here? You must collect the materials needed to repair the ward and deliver them to Raibaht with all speed!
- **7847**: Yes, those are the materials Raibaht needs. Deliver them to him with haste, and report back to me when the deed is done.
- **7850**: Thank you, friend. You've served us well. Are you with another regiment, perhaps? I've not seen you around these parts before. In any event, I should explain.
- **7851**: I am Ayame, a captain of the resistance effort. In the days before the Republic fell, I served as one of the Mythril Musketeers, the president's finest.
- **7852**: Yes, fell. I say, did you take a blow to the head somewhere along your journey? Why, there has been no Bastok ever since the first wave of fiends came and reduced the Metalworks to little more than a smoldering scrap heap.
- **7853**: Our vaunted Republican Army was soon overwhelmed--it was all we could do to round up the surviving civilians and lead them to safer ground.
- **7854**: ...
- **7855**: We thought to make for Gustaberg, until a massive landslide--unlike any I'd ever seen--sealed the path off right before our eyes. Left with nowhere else to run, we set up a makeshift base of operations here, from which we wage a desperate struggle for our very survival.
- **7856**: I know not where you hail from, but in this land, we must pool all of our wits and strength just to live to see the morrow. If you would be of aid to our cause, seek out the engineer Raibaht once more. He should have a suitable task for you. Now, I must return to my duties. Go safely, friend!
- **7857**: You return. Have you not yet spoken with Raibaht? If you've a mind to remain in our camp, we must ask you to assist in fortifying our defenses. I wish I did not have to impose upon you in this way, but banding together is the only way we will pull through this grim age...
- **7874**: <Player>. I'm glad you've come. I've been watching you closely since you first arrived in our camp, and I stand convinced--you have the potential to be a great ally to our cause.
- **7875**: I have a most vital task that I would entrust to you. The linkshell that was our sole line of communication to our field regiments suffered irreparable damage in the last incursion.
- **7876**: Working together we stand a chance, however slim. Splintered and isolated, we are as good as done for. <Player>. You must seek out our lost squadrons and deliver these linkpearls before it is too late.
- **7877**: There are three regiments, all told. One was on patrol just north of here when we lost contact with them. I fear I have no information on the whereabouts of the other two.
- **7878**: You may entrust the linkpearls to the acting commander of each regiment.
- **7879**: This seal will serve to identify you as a member of the resistance. Should anyone ask you for the password, it is "rose on the heath." Be swift, yet wary, <Player>!
- **7880**: You must deliver those linkpearls to our missing regiments with all haste. Remember, the password is "rose on the heath." Now be careful out there, <Player>!
- **7920**: <Player>! Thank the heavens you're safe!
- **7921**: It's not that I doubted your skills, of course, but you must understand... I've lost not a few capable [men/women] to lesser tasks.
- **7922**: In the days when the Republic still prospered, I could have offered you a more suitable reward. Times being as they are, though, this will have to suffice.
- **7923**: Dare I hope...? A captain must keep both her feet on the ground. It will not do for me to dream of castles in the air. And yet, I cannot help but feel that your presence here has changed something...
- **7924**: I know not what led you to us, or to what distant land you must someday return, but I pray that you will not neglect our plight.
- **7925**: Seek me out from time to time, and share with me your exploits. I shall see that you are rewarded in kind. Go in safety, <Player>.
- **8087**: Ah. Welcome back, <Player>. Hard at work as always, I see.
- **8088**: What's that? You want my honest appraisal of your accomplishments? Well, let me see...
- **8089**: You will return from time to time and share with me tales of your exploits, won't you, <Player>? Now go in safety.
- **8090**: <Player>! Oh, how I've been waiting for your return!
- **8091**: I knew when I first met you that you'd go far, but this... Why, the camp linkshell has been positively abuzz with tales of your heroics!
- **8092**: It's rare that we can find something to truly rejoice about these days. This is a present from everyone. Take it with our gratitude!
- **8093**: It was not so long ago that "hope" for us was but a dying ember on a fire long since gone cold. But watching you, <Player>... For the first time since the Republic fell, I get the feeling that anything is possible.
- **8094**: Yes, I would stake the future of Abyssea on you without a moment's hesitation. Go forth and bring a new dawn to our people!
- **8115**: Current progress: [Ancient abyssite obtained: $0/$1/Atma obtained: $2/$3/Quests completed: $4/$5/Return.]
- **8116**: [Requirement/Objective completed]: Obtain all ancient abyssite found in this area.
- **8117**: [Requirement/Objective completed]: Obtain all atma found in this area.
- **8118**: [Requirement/Objective completed]: Complete all quests issued in this area.
