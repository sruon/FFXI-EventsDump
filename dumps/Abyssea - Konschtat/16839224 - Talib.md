## String References

- **7957**: I ain't got no business with ya, and that means I don't wanna see ya. Get lost!
- **7958**: What have we here? Ah, you must be the one Argus was talkin' about.
- **7959**: From what they tell me, you can hold your own in a fight. Stop me if I'm wrong, here.
- **7960**: Good. I've been lookin' for someone like you. Now, I'm bettin' you've seen your share of fiends. Tall, short, two legs, four legs, no legs...flyin', crawlin', squirmin' and what-have-you.
- **7961**: You may have also noticed that ordinary weapons barely scratch 'em. Which got me to thinkin': if we could fashion armor out of the fiends' own hide, we might stand a better chance against 'em. Not t' mention that an astute entrepreneur could stand to make a pretty pile o' cruor sellin' such wares...
- **7962**: This is where you come in. Don't ask me why, but you pack quite a punch against those monsters. I've never seen anythin' like it.
- **7963**: Round up $1 $0 for me, and you can bet I'll make it worth your while.
- **7964**: How's business? Eh, I've done better. That's why I need your help.
- **7965**: Well, go figure. Finally a business partner who's good to [his/her] word. Guess I owe you the same. Here's your cut of the future profits.
- **7966**: Back for some more business? Bring me $1 more $0 and I'll see that you're handsomely paid.
- **7967**: Well, if it isn't our local celebrity. Sounds like your buddy Talib isn't the only one who's been profiting from your services. Keep it up!
