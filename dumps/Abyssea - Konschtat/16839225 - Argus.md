## String References

- **7882**: A stray beam of light catches <Player>'s $3, causing it to gleam for a moment.
- **7887**: You hand over $3.
- **7895**: Y-you...what are you doing here? Can't you see that it's not s-safe here...? Go...go and leave us to die in peace.
- **7896**: We l-lost communication with h-home base... Th-they're probably all dead. Not that it matters...we'll be j-joining them before long...
- **7897**: "R-rose on the...h-heath"...?
- **7898**: C-could the captain have s-sent you? But that's impossible...we were certain she was...
- **7899**: Friend, you have no idea how much this means to us. Please forgive my, ah, momentary lapse of courage. I will contact Captain Ayame immediately. We will find a way to fight on... We must...
- **7900**: Ah, it's you again. I cannot thank you enough for restoring our lines of communication...and some semblance of hope.
- **7901**: Tell me, though. How did you ever manage to make it to this remote place without being spotted by our foe? Are you trained in covert operations, perhaps?
- **7902**: As a matter of fact, we have others like you here, watching over the storehouse. At first, I thought them a bit shady, but there's no doubting their battle prowess. They've come to our aid many a time.
- **7903**: Their leader goes by the name of Talib. If you're looking to put your talents to use, why not go speak with him?
- **7904**: Y-you...what are you doing here? Can't you see that it's not s-safe here...?
- **7905**: I've lost...t-too many men... Stranded we are in this remote p-place... Once, I had hope... Now, my last b-breath cannot come soon enough...
- **7906**: Go...go and leave us to die in peace...
