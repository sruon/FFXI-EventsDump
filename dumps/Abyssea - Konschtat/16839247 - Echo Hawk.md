## String References

- **8061**: New to these parts? How's about I give you a crash course in survival, then? No need to thank me. Just doing my job.
- **8062**: You see the fellow over there by the maw? The conflux surveyor, as we call him? He can bestow you with something we call visitant.
- **8063**: The specifics are beyond the grasp of a layman like me, but he was quite insistent that I send all newcomers to him. Said it was quite literally a matter of life and death.
