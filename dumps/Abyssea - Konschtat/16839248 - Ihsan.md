## String References

- **8064**: When squaring off in combat with the Abyssean hordes, you'll want to identify and exploit their weaknesses.
- **8065**: Even the most fearsome fiends can be stopped dead in their tracks, or scared so witless they forget their most potent abilities. The trick is in learning how.
- **8066**: You'll also want to experiment with finishing off your foes in creative ways. Don't ask me why, but it's said there are rewards to be had this way.
