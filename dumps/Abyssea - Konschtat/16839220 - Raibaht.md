## String References

- **7848**: You've brought those for me? Much obliged, friend. I'll get right on the repairs. You can tell Captain Ayame that the ward'll hold steady for a while longer.
- **7849**: Oh, it's you again. Have you not reported back to Captain Ayame? You'd best be on your way.
- **7858**: Ah, the young [man/woman] who brought me my materials. I'm much in your debt for that one.
- **7859**: I've just finished up the preliminary repairs, but it'll be a while still before we're back to full strength. And then I've got the martellos to look after. No rest for the weary engineer, I tell you.
- **7860**: You're familiar with our martellos, are you not?
- **7861**: Know about martellos? [Sure do./Mar-what-os?]
- **7862**: Good. Saves me the trouble of a lengthy explanation.
- **7863**: Is that so? I'm surprised anyone could make it this far without encountering one. Very well. The martello is a defensive structure conceived by resistance engineers that serves as the keystone of our fortifications.
- **7864**: They run on a sort of magical fuel, you see. So long as the tanks are kept full, they'll serve to heal your wounds and revitalize your battle-weary body and mind. So long as the tanks are full--and therein lies the rub.
- **7865**: What with all of us fighting for our lives, it's all too easy to neglect to replenish the things until it's too late. That's why we all must learn to do our part.
- **7866**: Here, take this $3 and find yourself a martello in need of replenishment. It's a simple enough act, and one that could someday mean the difference between life and death for you or one of your comrades, so you'd do well to make a habit of it.
- **7867**: See the martello just over yonder? Why don't you try your hand at replenishing its fuel stores while you're at it. The more comfortable you become with the procedure, the better it will serve us all.
- **7868**: Now that wasn't so difficult, was it? The martellos you'll encounter in the field are key to our survival. Should you see one in need of replenishment, we ask that you lend a helping hand.
- **7869**: You've returned. How about it? I trust you're an old hand with martellos by now?
- **7870**: We've tasked a dedicated machine outfitter with the supervision of all martello-related matters around camp.
- **7871**: Should you wish to assist further with replenishment and repair, I encourage you to seek him out. He will furnish you with the necessary materials, as well as due recompense upon your successful return.
- **7872**: Mind you, you'll want to report back swiftly after finishing the job. We've far too much on our hands here to keep tabs on stragglers.
- **7873**: There you are, <Player>. Captain Ayame's been scouring the camp in search of you. I suggest you report to her on the double.
- **8069**: Yes? I'm busy here. If you haven't noticed, we're too occupied fighting for our lives to engage in idle chat.
- **8070**: Hm? You'll go on a materials run for me? Well, I'm not one to turn down an offer of aid.
- **8071**: I'm in need of $6, $6, and $6 to replenish our stock. Now go quickly. Time is of the essence.
- **8072**: <Sigh>... You new recruits can't do anything right. I'll say this once more. Listen well this time.
