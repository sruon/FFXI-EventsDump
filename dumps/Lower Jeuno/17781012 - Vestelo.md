- **11021**: Originally concentrated in the southern countries, it has finally made its way here after moving from place to place for many years.
- **11022**: However, never in my wildest dreams did I think that people would want to cuddle with morbols... What's this world coming to!?
- **11023**: What's that? You want to know if it's safe having such dangerous creatures on the loose?
