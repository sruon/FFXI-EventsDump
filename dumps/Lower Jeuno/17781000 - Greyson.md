## String References

- **11032**: Hm? Forgive me, but you'll need to come back when you have a little more experience as an adventurer and a deeper understanding of the Records of Eminence.
- **11033**: Hello, it is a pleasure to meet you. I have a feeling you're just the person I've been looking for.
- **11034**: Greyson stares at you intently.
- **11035**: Ah, my apologies. Please allow me to explain. I used to be an adventurer myself and can therefore discern your strength with a mere glance.
- **11036**: By chance, have you ever heard of the A.M.A.N. Reclaimers?
- **11037**: They're a group that goes around collecting various items and equipment.
- **11038**: They take equipment donated to the A.M.A.N. by retired adventurers and refurbish it before passing it along to active adventurers in need.
- **11039**: And yours truly is in charge of coordinating the collection of those items!
- **11040**: Well, I guess you could say I'm more of an employee doing the A.M.A.N.'s bidding. Hahaha...
- **11041**: So, if you bring me some $0, I'll exchange them for various goods.
- **11042**: You can obtain $0 by completing these Records of Eminence objectives.
- **11043**: I have a feeling an adventurer of your caliber is more than up to the task. I wish you luck, friend!
- **11044**: Stop by anytime and I'll take any $0 that you manage to collect.
- **11045**: When you have saved up enough, you can exchange them for special orbs that contain monsters as well as the aforementioned refurbished goods.
- **11046**: Hahaha! I know what you're thinking... Monsters? Inside of an orb?
- **11047**: From what I hear, the A.M.A.N. recreated the technology behind the orbs that are exchanged for beastmen seals and repurposed it for this occasion.
- **11048**: I guess the monsters are kind of a package deal along with the items! Hahaha!
- **11049**: Although, I suppose you could say it makes the whole process that much more interesting.
- **11050**: At any rate, I'm sure a hearty adventurer like yourself relishes such challenges!
- **11051**: You simply need to take the orbs you obtain here and throw them into the burning circles in Yughott Grotto, the Palborough Mines, and Giddeus in order to remove the seals and cause the orbs' contents to spring forth.
- **11052**: Oh, I should probably mention one more thing. The method for obtaining the contents of the chests is somewhat...unique.
- **11053**: First, a total of one metal chest and ten wooden chests will emerge from the orb, although one of the wooden chests is actually a mimic. That is the monster I was referring to previously.
- **11054**: You will receive the items once you open the metal chest. However, the more wooden chests you open before the metal one, the more items you'll receive!
- **11055**: In other words, the more wooden chests you're able to open while avoiding the mimic, the more goodies you'll get after opening the metal chest!
- **11056**: Obviously, you won't know whether a particular wooden chest is the mimic or not until you open it, so in the end, it pretty much comes down to sheer luck.
- **11057**: Greyson smiles at you gently.
- **11058**: Now then, if you'd like to know more about the orbs or anything else, feel free to ask away.
- **11059**: I'm also more than happy to explain to you the intricacies of rainbow chests, belligerent bangs, and previously used orbs.
- **11061**: What would you like to ask about? [Nothing in particular./Exchanging $0./Purchasing $0./A.M.A.N. Trove./Orbs./Obtaining $0./Rainbow chests./Belligerent bangs./Previously used orbs./You.]
- **11062**: Select an orb. (You have $8 [voucher/vouchers].) [Never mind./$0 ($9 vouchers)./$1 ($10 vouchers).]
- **11063**: Do you want to trade for the $30? [Yes./No.]
- **11064**: I'm sorry, but you do not have enough $0 to make the exchange.
- **11065**: Okay, we have a deal. Keep on earning those vouchers and I'll be right here waiting for you.
- **11066**: Purchase one voucher for $8 gil? [No thanks./Sure, I'll take one./I'll buy as many as I can. ($9 remaining)]
- **11067**: Um... I'm sorry, but you don't have enough money.
- **11068**: I'm sorry, but in order to prevent people from hoarding all of the items, there's a limit on how many vouchers can be purchased within a certain time period. You'll need to wait about one month (Earth time) before buying more.
- **11069**: Purchase $9 [voucher/vouchers] for $10 gil? [Yes./No.]
- **11070**: It's been a pleasure doing business with you!
- **11071**: Including the $0 I have on hand for you, you now have a total of $1 voucher[/s]. Let me know if you wish to exchange any for an orb.
- **11072**: The A.M.A.N. Trove is based on the use of special items such as $0 and $1.
- **11073**: So, you want to know about the difference between $0 and $1...
- **11074**: Basically, the difference comes down to the success rate of obtaining better-quality items. It's much easier to hit it big and win higher-quality items with $1.
- **11075**: Furthermore, the $1 ensures that at least one of your items will be of a certain quality.
- **11076**: Although, I imagine the definition of "quality" differs from person to person, so just think of it as a general guide.
- **11077**: On a separate note, I heard a rumor when I first started that the more you bring to the A.M.A.N., the more items you'll receive.
- **11078**: You can obtain $0 by completing the Records of Eminence objectives I gave you earlier.
- **11079**: And you can always buy them from me, too. However, there is a limit of $8 vouchers per month (Earth time) in order to prevent people from hoarding all of the items for themselves.
- **11080**: Among the wooden coffers you come across, a small fraction of them will be shimmering with a prismatic light.
- **11081**: These "rainbow chests" are sometimes present right from the outset, and they always contain a highly-sought-after reward inside.
- **11082**: Some who have ventured into the trove have reported that if they open eight wooden chests--meaning that the only one left contains a mimic--the remaining chest will be overcome with the selfsame rainbow glow.
- **11083**: Of course, I cannot even begin to fathom how lucky one would have to be for that to actually be the case. Perhaps it's but a rumor.
- **11084**: Ah, yes. The good old belligerent bangs.
- **11085**: The sound that the treasure chest makes when you eagerly open it, flinging the lid open and slamming it onto the back of the chest, has some correlation with whether or not the chest's reward is great, or merely "good."
- **11086**: Particularly astute adventurers will also note that opening a chest can provide a clue as to whether or not any of the remaining chests have particularly valuable rewards.
- **11087**: However, it takes a few treasure chests to be able to properly triangulate your internal sensing systems. Opening three should be sufficient.
- **11088**: If I could meet whomever or whatever was in charge of crafting these orbs, I would be inclined to give them a good smacking.
- **11089**: But let's keep that between us, hm?
- **11090**: Would you happen to be in possession of any used A.M.A.N. Trove orbs?
- **11091**: The A.M.A.N. believes that littering the ground with used trinkets harms the beauty of the landscape, so we are happy to provide you with proper compensation should you trade me used orbs instead of discarding them.
- **11092**: Who knows? If I'm feeling particularly generous that day, you may get a fresh orb for your troubles.
- **11093**: Hm? You wish to know more about me personally? Well, I used to be an adventurer myself, you see.
- **11094**: I might not look the part, but I fought on the front lines in many strange lands, earning merit points as a warrior, ninja, and various other jobs.
- **11095**: However, I made an important discovery about myself while leading that life.
- **11096**: I found that being forced to do things a certain way all in the name of efficiency kind of defeated the whole purpose of being an adventurer.
- **11097**: I felt that even though it might not always be the best way, it was important to be versatile when it came to party formations, fighting styles, and the like.
- **11098**: When I thought about it like that, I decided to retire and become a merchant in order to help like-minded adventurers in their journeys.
- **11099**: To that end, I purchased items that people no longer needed and looked to sell them in places where they were wanted...
- **11100**: However, I had trouble making ends meet and, as you can see from the looks of me, ended up quite poor. So, with nothing but the clothes on my back, I trudged on until I was introduced to this job by a contact from my adventurer days.
- **11101**: Now, I'm able to at least put food on the table while still realizing my dream of helping other adventurers, so it was all worth it.
- **11102**: Of course, I'm happy if I can turn a small profit along the way too, so I'd appreciate it if you could buy some $0 from me as well!
- **11103**: I have received a total of $1 $0 from you so far. Let me know if you wish to trade some of them for an orb.
- **11104**: Um... I'm sorry, but you can't carry any more. Would you like to exchange some for an orb or two?
