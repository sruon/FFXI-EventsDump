- **9810**: The weighty manual reads "Feeling lost in the labyrinth of life? Let Moblin Maze Mongers build the maze of your dreams!", and is divided into numerous chapters.
- **9811**: Which chapter will you read? [About "Moblin Maze Mongers."/Ordering Your Maze./Enjoying Your Maze./Rules and Regulations./About Moblin Marbles./Cave Conservation (C.C.) points./Your current C.C. points./(Close the book.)]
- **9812**: Moblin Maze Mongers is the revolutionary new business venture that's taking Vana'diel by storm! Making ingenious use of previously neglected caverns beneath Mindartia and Quon, our expert staff will create the perfect dungeon for you and your fellow adventurers!
- **9813**: Use one of our state-of-the-art "Maze Tabulae" to lay out the guidelines, and sit back as our craftsmen dig and delve to your demanding specifications!
- **9814**: Your maze will also be populated with a plethora of foul fiends and all manner of devious devices, all of which can also be customized to your liking!
- **9815**: The maze you design may be a relaxed jaunt for the novice adventurer, or it may be a diabolical demesne that will challenge even the most battle-hardened adventurers. With control over almost every aspect of your creation, the choice is yours!
- **9816**: So what are you waiting for? Let Moblin Maze Mongers build you the maze of your dreams--or nightmares--today!
- **9817**: Moblin Maze Mongers makes designing your own dungeon quick and painless! With three simple-to-use items--"Maze Tabulae," "Maze Vouchers," and "Maze Runes"--you'll be a mazebuilding master in no time.
- **9818**: The first and most important of these items is the "Maze Tabula," which stores the layout and content of your maze. By using other items in conjunction with the Maze Tabula, you can customize various elements of your dungeon.
- **9819**: Next you have the "Maze Voucher," a construction order that specifies the objectives that must be met to successfully complete your maze.
- **9820**: After receiving your Maze Voucher, we will proceed to build a maze according to your specifications. However, the Maze Voucher only dictates the final objectives for your dungeon--other details may be left to the whims of our craftsmen.
- **9821**: You'd rather customize the nitty-gritty details yourself, you say? Fear not! That's where "Maze Runes" come in. The use of Maze Runes is completely optional, and is intended for detail-oriented adventurers who want more direct control over their creation.
- **9822**: Be aware, however, that certain combinations of Maze Runes and Maze Vouchers are incompatible with each other, while others might produce unintended effects. Still, the possibilities are nearly limitless, so clients are encouraged to experiment!
- **9823**: You may notice that certain Maze Tabulae contain blackened squares, or squares containing elemental symbols.
- **9824**: Black squares indicate squares that cannot hold Maze Runes. Please manipulate your Maze Runes as necessary so that they do not touch any black squares.
- **9825**: Elemental squares will enhance the effect of any Maze Runes they come in contact with. Such Maze Runes will exert a far greater influence on your maze than under typical circumstances.
- **9826**: The concept of elemental opposition does not apply to the Maze Tabula. Provided that at least one compatible element exists, the Maze Rune in question will see its effect augmented.
- **9827**: After customizing your dungeon with the three items described above, please trade your completed Maze Tabula to the Maze Monger Shopfront.
- **9828**: Once your Maze Tabula is confirmed and you've paid the necessary excavation and construction fee, you and your companions will be escorted posthaste to your brand-spanking new, custom-built maze!
- **9829**: Customers should know that due to high demand for the Maze Mongers' services, only one maze order can be accepted from any single adventurer per [twenty hours/one hour] (Earth time).
- **9830**: However, there are no restrictions placed on using mazes created by other adventurers. Adventurers who would like to take on multiple mazes a day are strongly encouraged to cooperate with their friends.
- **9831**: This section will explain the procedure for adventuring in your custom-built maze from start to finish, entrance to exit!
- **9832**: After your order has been accepted and paid for, you and your companions will be escorted to the maze lobby. Please wait here patiently until the construction process is completed.
- **9833**: During this time, our lead foreman Packapic will provide you with a brief overview of the facilities. You will also be given the opportunity to purchase maze-specific items should you so desire.
- **9834**: After construction has completed, our gatekeeper and guide Rediroq will lead you and your companions into the maze. The challenge begins!
- **9835**: Should you manage to successfully complete the conditions specified on the Maze Voucher, a treasure chest will appear somewhere within the maze. What myriad riches may lie inside? You'll just have to see for yourself!
- **9836**: After successfully retrieving your reward, you are free to exit the maze. You may do so by any one of the following methods:
- **9837**: "Leaving From the Exit" Each maze will contain an exit door with a Maze Monger attendant posted in the vicinity. If spoken to, this attendant will lead all participants out of the maze.
- **9838**: Located near the exit is a beacon. Attendants have been instructed to trigger this as soon as the maze objectives have been successfully met, so you may use it as a guide in the event that you are unsure of your progress.
- **9839**: "Using a $0" A complimentary $0 will be presented to you free of charge before you enter the maze. Using this will cause the adventurer who used it--and that person alone--to be transported out of the maze.
- **9840**: "Emergency Extraction" Should unforeseen circumstances occur that are deemed to present an imminent danger to maze participants, Moblin Maze Mongers staff reserve the right to perform an emergency rescue operation to remove all participants from the maze.
- **9841**: Now you have all the necessary knowledge to enjoy your custom maze! Happy spelunking!
- **9842**: Clients should be aware of the following rules and regulations governing the use of Maze Monger mazes.
- **9843**: Adventurers who flee from a given maze without completing the stated objectives will not be permitted to re-enter that same maze.
- **9844**: Upon completing the objectives, a treasure chest is guaranteed to appear somewhere within the maze. Please do not forget to seek it out and claim your reward before exiting the dungeon.
- **9845**: Maze difficulty will, in principle, be tailored to the highest level adventurer in the event that a party contains adventurers of disparate skill levels. Note, however, that there may be exceptions to this depending on the objectives specified on your Maze Voucher.
- **9846**: We at Moblin Maze Mongers strongly encourage building and exploring mazes in parties. While we will not refuse solo clients, please be aware that completing the maze objectives alone may prove to be a difficult task.
- **9847**: Our expert craftsmen take the highest pride in the safety and stability of their work. Please understand, however, that due to the inherent tectonic instability of subterranean caverns, we cannot rule out the possibility of collapses or cave-ins occurring over the course of time.
- **9848**: In such cases, we reserve the right to initiate emergency rescue operations that will instantly transport all clients outside the maze to safety. Moblin Maze Mongers will accept no responsibility for treasures left unclaimed as a result of such a rescue operation, so adventurers are encouraged--for their own benefit--to proceed through the maze in a timely fashion.
- **9849**: In addition to the treasures to be gained within mazes, adventurers will also receive special tokens called "Moblin Marbles" as a reward for the successful completion of a maze.
- **9850**: These Moblin Marbles can be exchanged at the Maze Mongers office for a wide variety of exciting, exclusive goods and prizes!
- **9851**: How about a nice, shiny one of these?
- **9852**: Or a spiffy, sparkling one of these?
- **9853**: Rack up enough Moblin Marbles, and there's a veritable cornucopia of prizes to be had!
- **9854**: And that's not all--Moblin Marbles can also be used to purchase other benefits! These include the ability to register your completed Maze Tabulae and share your creations with adventurers far and wide, or an assortment of official designations.
- **9855**: Accumulate as many as you can and make the most of your maze-mongering experience!
- **9856**: There's only one copy, so don't ye go carryin' it off now. Jus' come back here if ye need t'look at it again.
- **9857**: Hmmmm...so ye want t'order a maze, do ye? Sorry, but our mazes aren't fer you greenhorn types. Come back when ye've seen more of the world, why don't ye?
- **9858**: Thanks to the loyal patronage of adventurers like you, business is positively booming here at Moblin Maze Mongers! We've been so successful, in fact, that unscrupulous rival corporations have sprung up trying to cash in on our profits!
- **9859**: With great success, though, comes great responsibility! Here at Moblin Maze Mongers, we are dedicated to preserving the pristine subterranean environment that makes our unique service possible. Regrettably, this means there are times when we must temporarily close our mazes for necessary maintenance.
- **9860**: At the same time, Moblin Maze Mongers always puts you, the customer, first! How can we reward our loyal customers for their part in keeping our caves clean and tectonically sound? Here's how: with our all-new Cave Conservation (C.C.) point system!
- **9861**: Customers will receive their first C.C. point [thirty-two hours/one hour and twenty minutes] (Earth time) after exiting a maze they have created, with another point being added every [eight hours/twenty minutes] (Earth time) thereafter. A maximum of six points may be accumulated at any one time.
- **9862**: And what will C.C. points earn you? More loot, that's what! Ordering a maze with C.C. points in your possession will result in the appearance of an additional, bonus treasure chest upon completion of your objectives! The contents will vary based upon your Maze Voucher, with greater riches awaiting you for each C.C. point you've accumulated.
- **9863**: Please be aware that your C.C. points will be reset to zero upon ordering a new maze. Any treasure that goes unclaimed will revert to the property of Moblin Maze Mongers. No returns, no refunds.
- **9864**: Let's see here... Looks like ye've got yerself $0 C.C. [point/points].
