## String References

- **7794**: Your $3 has been attuned to a geomagnetic fount[/ in front of the Peacekeepers' Coalition/ in front of the Scouts' Coalition/ at the Statue of the Goddess/ at the wharf to Yahse Hunting Grounds/ in front of your Rent-a-Room/ in front of the auction house/ on Sverdhried Hillock/ in the Coronal Esplanade/ at the gates of Castle Adoulin]!
- **7976**: You're an adventaru...right? I need someone's help, but...if you're not registered with the Pioneers' Coalition, you cannot help me.
- **7977**: This little thingy-wing here next to me--it's extreeemely <yawn> interesting, isn't it?
- **7978**: Display interest? [Well, seeing that enthusiasm.../Pfft. No.]
- **7979**: That's a shame to hear. It's really quite a powerful little thing.
- **7980**: If you change your mind, you know where to findy-wind me. Not like I've anywhere better to go.
- **7981**: Like most pioneers, you must be aware that this is called a...a "waypointaru."
- **7982**: It enables you to warp to differentaru locations. Obviously.
- **7983**: But without $6 attuned to the area, you cannot use them. <Zzz>
- **7984**: Huh? Where am...? Oh, sorry. There are so many of these things all over Eastern Adoulin that sometimes I lose my bearing-wearings.
- **7985**: Record all the data in each area...I'm sure it will help you. Yes, somehow.
- **7986**: Here...start with this one right nextaru to us. Ohhh...my head. How many of you do I have to explain this to?
- **7987**: Now you have recorded the data-wata in this waypoint. Congratulations on your <yawn> momentous accomplishment.
- **7988**: Oh...you've already recorded the data here. Nice work. Bet that took a lot of effort. <Snort>
- **7989**: A small amount of kinetic units will let you use waypoints as much as you want...but only if you've recorded the data from them first. Phew, is it really hotaru out here, or is it me?
- **7990**: So get out there and start recording! No, seriously, leave.
- **7991**: You want to...know where the others are? I swear, some adventurers want everything handed to them on a silver plattaru.
- **7992**: One is straight to the east of here, in the plaza where the statue-watue of Altana stands. You do know who Altana is, right? Or do I need to give a theology lesson, too?
- **7993**: One is rightaru to the south, in front of the Scouts' Coalition. Why don't you go ask them for information, instead of standing here bothering me?
- **7994**: One is to the north near the wharf that leady-weads to the Yahse Hunting Grounds. That's right, the wharf. You know, where the boatarus dock?
- **7995**: One is a bit to the south, deep within the alleyways, where your Rent-a-Room is. Yes, that place you go tumbling-wumbling back to at night after "protecting us from villainous creatarus."
- **7996**: From the southwestern part of the plaza head south and then east, in frontaru of the auction house. You know what I wish they sold at the auction house? Better jobs.
- **7997**: East from the plaza, on Sverdhried Hillock, which leads to Adoulin Castle. A "hillock" is a big slopey-wope. It would be a shame if you were to, say...sprain your ankle on the way up.
- **7998**: And one up past the hillock...at the entrance-wentrance to Coronal Esplanade. Did you realize that "esplanade" is just a fancy-wancy name for "walkway"?
- **7999**: And more...one beyond there, in front of the gate to Adoulin Castle. Castle. You know, big thing? Nobility lives there, etc., etc.?
- **8000**: Far be it from a simple laytaru like me to dictate the rules of engagementaru, but start from the top and work your way down. It'll be easier.
- **8001**: You've recorded all the data...congratulations. This will surely go down in the annals of history-wistory.
- **8002**: Maybe I shouldn't be so harshy-warsh. Here's your reward. Take it before I change my mind.
- **8003**: How are you finding the waypointarus? You'd better not have made me go through all that explanation for nothing!
- **8004**: [Mr./Ms.] pioneer, [sir/ma'am]! I need your helpy-welp!
- **8005**: Meg...Meg is sick.
- **8006**: But...I have to sit here like some window dressing and assistaru all you pioneers, so I can't go check up on her.
- **8007**: It pains me to ask for your aid, but could you use this $3 and take a looky-wook at her for me?
- **8008**: I'm so worried about them all...even Emily, Pinono, and Josephine in Western Adoulin... Waypointarus are such gentle beasts. Not always demanding directions and being cavalier in pursuit of ever increasing riches, unlike a certain adventaru I could name.
- **8009**: Use the $3 to scrutinize-wutinize them for me. You owe me that much.
- **8010**: Oh...and don't go about calling her by her firstaru name. I'm the only one allowed to do that.
- **8011**: She's the one in frontaru of the auction house in Western Adoulin.
- **8012**: Wow, you actually did it? Hmph. First adventurer in a while who's worth [his/her] saltaru.
- **8013**: <Grumble> Guess that means I gotta give you something-womething, doesn't it?
- **8014**: Here. Just don't tell anyone I gave it to you, or they'll all come running to "assistaru me" and bleed me dry.
- **8015**: Yes, yes, you checked Meg out, but there are other waypointarus who also need your help!
- **8063**: What a pickle-wickle.
- **8064**: You! Yes, <Player>, you! I feel the bile-wile rising in my throataru at the thought of this, but...I need your help.
- **8065**: Remember those waypointarus you helped me with before? Well, they're fine, but now it's the ones outside the city that are giving me trouble-wouble.
- **8066**: My precious little ones, always doing what's rightaru for the populace. Unlike some people.
- **8067**: I need you to look after the ones in Jeuno and the frontier-wontier stations. And how dare you patronize me for caring about my babies! They've helped more people than you have, and that's a factaru.
- **8068**: Poor little Chapi, floating out there all alone in a foreign land...
- **8069**: The energies in the Middle Lands are weaker than those here, though someone lacking in astutaruness like yourself probably can't tell. That makes it hard to fix them.
- **8070**: My sweet proto-wotos are designed specifically for your backwards homeland, so they should be fine, at least.
- **8071**: But Chapi is super special. She needs to connect you people with Adoulin, and so requires some unique equipmentaru.
- **8072**: Thus the Inventors' Coalition came up with a new adjustmentaru for our always-reliable $5.
- **8073**: Thus, I need you to go back and check up on Chapi. I would apologize for the trouble, but there's no need to concerny-wern myself with such details.
- **8074**: I'm suffering heataru stroke waiting here for you. What took so long?
- **8075**: I should be thankful-wankful that you did what you were asked--but I'm not. At least Chapi should be fine for the time being.
- **8076**: What's this? You want a reward for your effortarus? <Huff> Fine. Just don't expectaru anything else if I need you again!
