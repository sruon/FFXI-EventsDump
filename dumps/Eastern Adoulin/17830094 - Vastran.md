## String References

- **7874**: Hey, aren't you one of those pioneers from Jeuno? How's Adoulin treating you?
- **7875**: There's so much to do here in Eastern Adoulin, I bet you don't know where to start!
- **7876**: Hey, that gives me an idea! Why don't you go and make the rounds for me? That way, you get to see the sights and I get to...stay here!
- **7877**: I've got a list of where you need to go... ...Wait, where'd I put...? Aha! There it is!
- **7878**: Here you go. Just follow this route and check for anything out of the ordinary.
- **7879**: We're the perfect duo, you and me! Just think of how much I...<cough> the citizens appreciate your help!
- **7880**: Don't go getting lost along the way and having the Twelve Orders step on your toes, okay?
- **7916**: Hey, pal!
- **7917**: How was it? Eastern Adoulin sure has a lot to offer, don't you think?
- **7918**: Much of the nobility lives in this area. So many movers and shakers that sometimes I just stop in awe...of the injustice!
- **7919**: In part because of this, patrols here are a lot more tiring than in Western Adoulin.
- **7920**: But the West directly borders the jungle, so I think it's high time they stop paying so much attention to those bayld bursars and tighten things up over there instead!
- **7921**: Don't you think?
- **7922**: On my days off I sometimes go around and make sure things are ok, sometimes with the young lads who live in the area.
- **7923**: To be frank, while you were going around here in the East I went down to the West to...you know, check things out.
- **7924**: Seeing all those kids working hard for Adoulin makes me realize that I can't slack off either!
- **10436**: Eastern Adoulin is chockablock full of arrogant nobles and their inflated senses of self-worth. Be careful when approaching them, for even the most trivial perceived slight will set them off on a tirade belittling your "woeful lack of civility."
- **10437**: They're also the reason the Peacekeepers' Coalition was erected here. They act as if pedigree equals privilege and want someone to protect their "historic structures of cultural import" from us "filthy vermin" at all times.
