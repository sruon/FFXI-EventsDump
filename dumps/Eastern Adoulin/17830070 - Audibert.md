## String References

- **9977**: There's no way we'll get any further without more data. If only we could find someone willing to...
- **9978**: You there! Are you familiar with the leafkin?
- **9979**: They're creatures about as big as coconuts, and they wrap themselves in leaves for clothing. They're so adorable that I just want to give them a big hug!
- **9980**: They may not be a part of mankind, but I wouldn't go so far as to call them "monsters." They aren't aggressive, and they have many fans throughout Adoulin.
- **9981**: The Scouts' Coalition wants to learn more about their behavioral patterns and life cycles, but we lack any credible information.
- **9982**: That being the case, we're looking for people willing to assist in our surveys.
- **9983**: Please, think of the leafkin.
- **9984**: How about it? [Sure./Let's "leaf" this alone.]
- **9985**: Dang it! Well, you know where to find me if you change your mind.
- **9986**: Let's get right down to business, then. Step one is to gather information in town.
- **9987**: I've received reports of leafkin sightings from the Couriers', Pioneers', and Peacekeepers' Coalitions.
- **9988**: However, we have to verify the authenticity of any information we receive if we don't want to go on a wild-goose chase.
- **9989**: Should you come across any promising leads, follow up on them by going to the source, and report back to me with your findings.
- **9990**: I suggest you get started by visiting the other coalitions I've mentioned--Couriers', Pioneers', and Peacekeepers'.
- **9999**: You're the [man/woman] who's been assisting us with the leafkin investigation? Any news?
- **10000**: Hmm? A rusty pioneer's pickaxe...?
- **10001**: You caught it while fishing in the Zoldeff River?
- **10002**: Now that you mention it, the Pioneers' Coalition has reported large quantities of equipment vanishing.
- **10003**: The leafkin are behind it, aren't they? What are they playing at, hampering the progress of our efforts?
- **10004**: I'll inform the Pioneers' Coalition of the situation.
- **10005**: The leafkin are planting seedlings? Hmm...
- **10006**: Well, they DO use leaves and fruit as garb. Trying to replenish the forest to fashion more garb, no doubt.
- **10007**: That would explain why they feel threatened by our activities in Ulbuka.
- **10008**: You saw a leafkin...take an umbril head-on!? I didn't think they had such gumption in their buds!
- **10009**: Umbrils are ancient, mysterious creatures that have nested in Ulbuka since time immemorial.
- **10010**: We know as little about them as we do the leafkin. Perhaps the two are natural enemies?
- **10011**: This is really something to ponder. We'll make sure to analyze the leafkin in light of what we've learned about the umbrils.
- **10012**: We might be able to use this as a foothold for further knowledge.
- **10013**: You've delivered us some valuable information. The coalition cannot offer much in terms of payment, but it is the thought that counts--not the size of the reward.
- **10014**: Come back if you learn anything more.
- **10015**: You've come up with far more than we could have expected. This will help our research proceed much more smoothly.
- **10016**: The more we learn, the more we realize we don't know. Unique creatures, indeed, these leafkin.
- **10017**: They must have some purpose in life that we cannot yet comprehend...
- **10018**: ...Pay no attention to my ramblings. A member of the Scouts' Coalition should not speak authoritatively without sufficient proof.
- **10019**: One day, we'll figure out what makes them tick. I'm sure you'll be interested in our findings as well.
- **10020**: The leafkin surely are mystifying creatures. I hope you're looking forward to what we find out about them as much as we are.
