## String References

- **5616**: Welcome to the Commissions Agency. Our commissions are only available to authorized mercenaries of level 50 or above. Please return when you meet the necessary requirements.
- **5629**: You will see a number of counters here to your left.
- **5630**: Each of these counters is responsible for a particular Assault area.
- **5631**: The personnel at these counters will give you a detailed explanation of the available Assault missions.
- **5632**: However, you will only be able to undertake Assault missions that correspond to your mercenary rank. The Commissions Agency is prohibited by Imperial law from disclosing mission information to persons without the proper level of clearance.
- **5633**: After selecting a mission, present your $3 for verification.
- **5634**: Assault missions are only open to mercenaries of level 50 or above. Please be sure your job is of the appropriate level before signing up.
- **5636**: Assault missions have a minimum member requirement. This figure represents the number of party members who must be present in order to begin the mission.
- **5637**: Please form a party with a sufficient number of members who have all signed up for the same Assault mission.
- **5638**: After forming a party, make your way to the mission staging point located at the entrance to the applicable Assault area.
- **5639**: To facilitate a speedy journey to the staging point, I would suggest utilizing the "runic portal" within the "Chamber of Passage" located opposite this building.
- **5640**: Please be aware that in order to utilize the runic portal from the Chamber of Passage, you must first attune yourself to the runic portal found at the staging point in question.
- **5641**: Under normal circumstances, use of the runic portal will deplete your Imperial Standing. However, persons in possession of Assault orders are exempt from this charge.
- **5642**: Upon arriving at the staging point, a representative from your Assault party should speak with the Immortal on duty to receive verification of command.
- **5643**: The verified representative should then activate the "runic seal" at the entrance to begin the Assault mission.
- **5645**: When an Assault mission begins, you will be transported to an area where the level of enemies is based on the highest-level member of your party.
- **5646**: It is also possible to accept a voluntary level restriction during Assault. In this case, your party will be sent to an area based upon the adjusted level limit.
- **5647**: Once you have arrived in the area, the time limit for the mission will be announced. If you do not complete the mission objectives within this time, the mission will be considered a failure.
- **5648**: To successfully complete a mission, it is necessary to activate the "rune of release" that appears after the mission objectives have been fulfilled.
- **5649**: It is possible to abandon a mission and be transported out of the Assault area by using homing fireflies to guide you. Naturally, the mission will be considered a failure in this case.
- **5650**: Before being transported to the Assault area, all party members will be issued with homing fireflies.
- **5651**: Homing fireflies are temporary items that cannot be taken out of an Assault area.
- **5652**: Other temporary items will also be available during Assault missions.
- **5654**: After successfully completing an Assault mission, the Empire will award you with Assault Points.
- **5655**: These points are only awarded for participation in Assault missions, and are accumulated separately for each Assault area.
- **5656**: Each area has specific items available that can be purchased in exchange for Assault Points.
- **5657**: You can check your Assault Point totals and purchase items from the counters to your left.
- **5658**: Thank you for visiting the Commissions Agency. Please do not hesitate to ask me any questions you may have concerning the Assault mission application procedure.
- **5659**: Welcome to the Commissions Agency. How may I help you?
- **5660**: How may I help you? [I need $6. ($1 left)/Cancel application./Ask about Assault.]
- **5661**: Please present this at one of the counters to your left.
- **5662**: A new $3 can be issued at . (Earth Time: )
- **5663**: A new $3 can be issued to you immediately.
- **5664**: I'm sorry, but I cannot issue a new $3 while you have one in your possession.
- **5665**: A new $3 cannot be issued until you complete your current Assault mission.
- **5666**: Do you truly wish to cancel your Assault application?
