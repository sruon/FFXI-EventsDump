## String References

- **7509**: At least we've managed to establish a foothold...not that it's done us much good.
- **7510**: There's a mantid here that's a particular blight on the land. Not satisfied to simply eat other vermin, it turns its mandibles on us as well!
- **7511**: Most mantids reside somewhere north of here, but this one has migrated south to wreak havoc upon those of us unlucky enough to get within reach of its razor-sharp claws.
- **7512**: I'd like to exterminate the pest, but I have little training in either sword or spell. Could you teach them that we pioneers mean business?
- **7513**: I can tell you the best way to take care of it. Those foul vermin devour chapuli the way you or I would devour steak, so if you use a chapuli as bait you should be able to lure it out into the open.
- **7514**: When it's caught you in its pincers, survival comes down to your skills. Give it what it deserves, but don't get cocky. If you succeed, I'll have a little something for you when you come back.
- **7515**: Some part of me thought you would fail--but I'm glad you proved me wrong! Now we should have an easier time opening Eastern Ulbuka to the masses.
- **7516**: But I fear that the mantids aren't our biggest enemy. As we progress further into the continent, we keep finding greater threats that dwarf what we have seen to date.
- **7517**: Our ancestors chose to spurn pioneering efforts many centuries ago, erecting Jorius Yett to keep us safe from the horrors of Ulbuka...and now I can see why.
- **7518**: I can't shake the feeling that there's something out there, waiting for us to make a misstep. When that time comes, we'll all be counting on you.
- **7519**: For now, though, I promised you a reward. Take it with my thanks.
