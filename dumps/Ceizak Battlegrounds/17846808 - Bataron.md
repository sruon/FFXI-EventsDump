## String References

- **7523**: You there! You look like you can handle yourself with my little wasp hive problem. To be a bit clearer, the things themselves aren't the problem--it's what resides inside them.
- **7524**: If they were empty, I'd go get rid of the lot myself. But look at me--do I look like I can go taking a mace to a monster?
- **7525**: No, no I cannot. That's why I'm looking for someone to smash into the nests and take care of some of the belaboring wasps inside.
- **7526**: A number? You really want a number to kill? <Sigh> I want to say "as many as you can," but you've probably got better things to do...so let's say $1. Does that sound doable?
- **7527**: You actually went out and killed them for me? What a pal! Hopefully they didn't sting you too much.
- **7528**: There's something I didn't tell you--those wasps you took care of barely scrape the honeycomb of what's out there.
- **7529**: No, much more fearsome beasts exist in Eastern Ulbuka.
- **7530**: Have you ever heard tales of the Naakuals? These loathsome creatures are demigods of the region, beasts of immense power that make other dangers look like bothersome Goblins.
- **7531**: Children are told fairytales of one Naakual making the Ceizak Battlegrounds its domain. Yet in recent months, pioneers have reported sightings that send chills down the spines of Adoulin's governing body.
- **7532**: <Whisper> I have said too much. They have eyes and ears everywhere. <Cough> For now, accept your just reward for a task well done.
