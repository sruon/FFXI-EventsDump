## String References

- **7466**: It's about time! [I want to buy a scoop./What is all this scooping?/What do I get for scooping?/I need a bowl.]
- **7467**: Get out your [wallet, mister/purse, lady].
- **7470**: Are you stupid? Scooping is scooping! [How do I scoop?/What can I scoop?/Why should I scoop?/What is your problem?]
- **7471**: Equip $0 in your Range slot! Equip $1 in your Ammo slot! Find some water and fish! What's so hard about that!?
- **7472**: Don't think you can do your scooping just anywhere, though. Look for the fireworks displays. After you're done scooping, bring the fish to me! You think you can handle that!?
- **7473**: Why, goldfish, of course! What else would you scoop!? There are three known kinds! Can you count that high!? One, two, three!
- **7474**: % are quick and tiny. Any sissy with a scoop can grab one. You're lucky that I even give you a point for each one you bring.
- **7475**: $1 are black and heavy. I'll give you two points for one, but only because I'm a nice guy!
- **7476**: Finally, $2 are big and mean...like me! So if your puny scoop survives the ordeal, I'll give you ten points for one!
- **7477**: Consider yourself lucky that I'm even telling you this, but there may be other kinds lurking about as well. If you can catch any of them, I'll consider giving you bonus points!
- **7478**: What!? You're asking me how a goldfish can survive in hot springs like these? How am I supposed to know!? Do I look like a goldfish scientist to you!?
- **7479**: Why should you scoop!? Why shouldn't you scoop? Just look at all the junk you can get from scooping!
- **7480**: $0 points will buy you another $1. "Keep the scooping alive," that's my motto!
- **7481**: Or you can trade $0 points for a bag of fireworks. Don't even ask me what kind of firework is in the bag, though...'cause I don't know!
- **7482**: Fork over $0 points and I'll give you some fans to cool off. You do look kind of sweaty, even for an adventurer!
- **7483**: $0 points will get you a sweet colored drop! I was raised on those things, and just look how I turned out!
- **7484**: $0 points can be exchanged for what's in the mystery box! What is in the mystery box? Well, it wouldn't be much of a mystery if I told you now, would it!?
- **7485**: Remember, you have to earn points if you want the prizes, and you have to scoop goldfish if you want points!
- **7487**: Finally come to your senses, eh!? Here's your $0. And don't lose it, loser!
- **7488**: You lost your $0!? And you wonder why people call you a loser!
- **7489**: Well, loser, it just happens to be your lucky day. I can give you another $0, but all the points you have earned up till now will be lost as well.
- **7490**: Start over from the top? [On second thought.../Don't make me answer twice!]
- **7491**: Whatever you say, champ!
- **7492**: All right, take this! And try to take better care of it this time!
- **7493**: Wait a minute... You already have $0! Don't tell me that you want to start over... Are you really that stupid!?
- **7494**: I'll be... You really are that stupid. Well, I guess I can't complain. Bozos like you are good for business!
- **7495**: You have $0 point[/s]. [$1: $2./A bag of fireworks: $3./Large fans: $6./A colored drop: $4./The mystery box: $5./A stellar surprise: $9./The other mystery box: $7./Yet another mystery box: $8./Mystery box part four: $10./Nothing.]
- **7496**: Are you trying to pull a fast one on me? Because if you are...!
- **7497**: Are you sure that's what you really want? We offer no refunds, you know!
- **7498**: What to do... [I've changed my mind./Give me my prize!]
- **7499**: Geesh! What's got you all upset!?
- **7500**: If you can't make up your mind, then you're wasting my time! Get out of here!
- **7501**: Well, look who's back! What do you have there!?
- **7502**: That's it!? $0 point[/s] is all that you're getting.
- **7503**: Not bad... Not good, but not bad. Here's $0 points for you.
- **7504**: Where did you get all these!? You didn't steal them from some little Tarutaru, did you!? Here, take $0 points.
- **7505**: Why, my blind, one-armed granddaddy could scoop up more fish in his toilet than you just did.
- **7506**: Don't go getting your hopes up, now. You still stink at scooping...just not as bad as most people! Now, get back out there!
- **7507**: But if I find out that there was any foul play involved, your head's going to be on my dinner platter!
- **7509**: % glares at you as he grinds his teeth...
- **7513**: Remember, $0 points will score you what's in the other mystery box! And to top that, we've got yet another mystery box for you this year. $1 points and it's yours! Why so much mystery? Why not!
- **7515**: And for a special treat this year, $0 points will earn you...dum dum dum...a stellar surprise! What's that, you ask? Why, it's so much of a surprise that they haven't even told me!
- **7516**: And what is this!? For $0 you can lands yourself an incredibly goregous happi!? Why did we wait so long to put this festival feature on the shelves!?
