## String References

- **7358**: An adventurer, are you? I am Ruillont of the Temple Knights. I came here without my sword, and now fiends have surrounded me.
- **7359**: As the "wounded" knight for our training, I was to lie near the entrance. But a swarm of fiends happened upon me, and I was forced to flee into this cave.
- **7360**: Since I had left my sword with a companion, I had to find a place to hide...and now I'm stuck here.
- **7361**: What? You've come to rescue me?
- **7362**: I must refuse!
- **7363**: Imagine, a knight rescued by some passerby! Why, my family would be mocked for generations to come!
- **7364**: Confound it! If I only had my sword, I'd cut through these fiends single-handedly...
- **7368**: My sword! You've brought me my sword!
- **7371**: This is just what I needed. I thank you, adventurer.
- **7372**: I'll be fine from here on out. Please let my captain know...
