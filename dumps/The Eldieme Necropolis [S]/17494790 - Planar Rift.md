- **8129**: The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called "Voidwalkers." Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.
- **8130**: Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized. This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.
- **8131**: Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed "Voidwatch Operations," or "Ops" for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.
- **8132**: A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time "Voidwatcher" status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.
- **8133**: Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.
- **8134**: Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world. Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.
- **8135**: Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.
- **8136**: Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.
- **8137**: However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.
- **8138**: When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it. These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.
- **8139**: Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.
- **8140**: The "voidstone" is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.
- **8141**: Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation. Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.
- **8142**: As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.
- **8143**: Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.
- **8144**: Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.
- **8145**: After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.
- **8146**: Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.
- **8147**: Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.
- **8148**: While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.
- **8149**: Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as "ascent items."
- **8150**: Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.
- **8151**: Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.
- **8152**: Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.
- **8153**: Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.
- **8154**: The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.
- **8155**: The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.
- **8156**: Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.
- **8157**: Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.
- **8158**: Atmacite is the physical agglomeration of a monster's soul, and a vessel for its feral instincts. By infusing atmacite to one's body using $6, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.
- **8159**: Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.
- **8160**: Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.
- **8161**: Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.
- **8162**: As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.
- **8163**: Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.
- **8164**: Atmacite can be enriched in stages to a maximum of level $0.
- **8165**: All Voidwatchers are urged to make atmacite enrichment a priority, for they might just mean the difference between life and death.
- **8166**: Periapt are lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.
- **8167**: Especially sought after are those bestowing temporary items at the commencement of an operation, granting combatants a distinct advantage against the enemy.
- **8168**: Although their acquisition can only be described as arduous, the benefits make them well worth the effort.
- **8221**: Use $6? [Yes, use with $5./Yes./No.]
- **8222**: How many $5 will you use? [None./One./Two./Three./Four./Five.]
