## String References

- **7025**: Interested? [What is it?/I'm too busy.]
- **7038**: Eh? What does an adventurer like you want with me? Shouldn't you be out fighting beastmen, bringing peace to the world and all that?
- **7039**: Eh? Another fledgling adventurer? There seem to be more and more of you people these days.
- **7040**: I may be able to teach you a thing or two... Interested?
- **7041**: I'm glad you are. But I won't talk for free. Why don't you bring me $0 for starters, eh?
- **7042**: Not that I'd be terribly upset with $6, provided you could get your hands on one.
- **7043**: Bring her what she wants? [Sure./Maybe later.]
- **7044**: Good. I'll be waiting here.
- **7045**: Oh? It's for your own good, you know...
- **7046**: Oh? Your loss, then. It's something you really should know...
- **7047**: Where can you find $0? Well...you'll just have to look for yourself. Hoh-hoh.
- **7048**: Hoh-hoh. Yes, this is what I asked for. I'm ready to talk now.
- **7049**: So, you see... Oh, dear. What was I going to say? I forget so many things these days.
- **7050**: Hmm...you know, I heard $0 is good for your memory.
- **7051**: If you bring me some, I might remember what I was trying to tell you. Would you go look for some?
- **7052**: Thank you. I'll try to remember on my own in the meantime.
- **7053**: That's too bad for you. I'm sure whatever I was going to tell you would've helped you a lot. Are you sure you won't go?
- **7054**: Ah! Yes, this is it. But I managed to remember without it. Hoh-hoh. Now, listen close...
- **7055**: Have you ever seen people use abilities from jobs other than their main one? Those people are using something called "support jobs."
- **7056**: And if you can't use support jobs, you don't deserve to be called an adventurer! But I can help you with that. Hoh-hoh.
- **7057**: It's all up to you, but if you do want me to teach you...you'll have to bring me $0 first.
- **7058**: Hmm... I see you've got some vim after all. You may become a real adventurer yet. Hoh-hoh. All right, I'll teach you about support jobs as I promised.
- **7059**: You can add a support job to your main one wherever you can change jobs. Of course, it has to be a job you've already acquired.
- **7060**: But whatever you choose as your support job, its effective level will never exceed half that of your main one. Your support job won't benefit from any experience points you gain, either. It is, after all, only meant to be supplemental.
- **7061**: Let me give you an example: Let's say you've achieved level 20 as a warrior and level 10 as a white mage. If you choose warrior as your main job and white mage as your support job, the following will occur...
- **7062**: Your warrior level stays the same at 20, and your effective level in white mage also stays at 10--half the level of your main job. In this case, both jobs function to the fullest in their roles.
- **7063**: Now, say you choose the same white mage job as your main one and put your warrior job as your support job...
- **7064**: Your white mage level is still 10, but the effective level of your warrior job drops to 5, half the level of your main job. Now, that's a lot of wasted potential, isn't it? Hoh-hoh.
- **7065**: And selecting a job with a level less than half of your main one as your support job isn't going to do you much good, either. Make sure you're using your jobs to their fullest when choosing support jobs.
- **7066**: As to which job is best suited to your main job...ideally, it should be one that either covers your main job's weaknesses, or one that enhances its strengths.
- **7067**: ...That's about it. Is everything clear?
- **7068**: Do you understand how support jobs work? [Got it./Can you run that by me again?]
- **7069**: Good. Then why are you still here? Go try it out, already! And don't forget to thank me when it saves your skin. Hoh-hoh.
- **7070**: Oh, you again. You must've thought I was asking you to bring me those things out of greed. Hoh-hoh.
- **7071**: But you realize I was only testing you to see if you could actually get them. I used to be in the Market...Mooseket...Muskewhatchamacallits before, you know?
- **7072**: You look dubious. I did teach you how to use support jobs, didn't I? Well, you're free to believe whatever you want, but what you have now is real power. Use it wisely. Hoh-hoh.
- **7111**: Accept this request? [Yes./No.]
