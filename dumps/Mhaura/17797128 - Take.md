## String References

- **6874**: Welcome to the Sailors' Stay. Hm? You're looking for work? Well, I guess we could always use an extra hand...
- **6875**: Go talk to our resident cook, Rycharde. He should be around here somewhere.
- **6878**: Yes, can I help you? I'm sorry, I personally don't have any work for you to do. Have you talked to Rycharde?
- **6908**: Rycharde is a good cook. I'm glad to hear you've been working hard to help him. Good luck to you both!
- **6922**: Hi, there. You've been working for Rycharde for a while now...do you know what's wrong with him lately? He looks down.
- **6923**: What? He sent you to Valgeir? Let me guess: he refused to recognize Rycharde's talents again, right?
- **6924**: Valgeir is Rycharde's father, and one of the best cooks in Vana'diel. He's also a very strict man, especially to his son.
- **6925**: He raised Rycharde to be a great cook like him, but there were some things they could never agree on. In the end, Rycharde ended up leaving home.
- **6926**: Rycharde has worked hard and become a very good cook. Valgeir really should give him some credit. Don't you agree?
- **6927**: But you know what? I wouldn't mind tasting some of Valgeir's cooking someday. I wonder what it's like?
- **6928**: You went and brought me some of Valgeir's cooking? Thank you! I'll have Rycharde taste some of it, too.
- **6929**: And here, take these. It's the least I can do.
- **6930**: Thank you for working so hard to help Rycharde. I promise I'll have him taste some of his father's cooking.
- **6942**: Thanks for bringing some of Valgeir's cooking. It was delicious! I think tasting it really helped Rycharde.
- **6956**: Have you seen Rycharde lately? He seems changed. He has this look of determination I've never seen before.
- **6957**: He must've rediscovered something deep inside...something he had long forgotten. I'm glad for him, and it's all thanks to you.
- **7118**: You may not believe me, but before airships started to fly, this inn was packed all year round.
- **7119**: Those days are long past, and this town is a little on the dingy side now, but we Mhaurans haven't changed. Some of us have our quirks, but we all still welcome travelers with open arms.
