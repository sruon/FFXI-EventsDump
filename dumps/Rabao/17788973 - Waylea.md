## String References

- **10063**: Huh? <Player>? Never heard that name before. Is that somebody famous? Oh, that's you?
- **10064**: Hmm. I'm guessing you haven't been taking on many requests from people. You know, if you keep that up, no one is going to remember you.
- **10065**: Even doing small favors is fine at first. If you help out a lot of different people, you'll slowly gain their trust. Before you know it, everyone will know your name.
- **10066**: ...<Player>? I think I have some vague memory of hearing that name somewhere... Nope, it's gone.
- **10067**: But this just goes to show how few people know you around here. You've gotta put yourself out there more, my young adventurer friend.
- **10068**: Hm? <Player>? I've heard that name before. Seems you're building yourself a good reputation.
- **10069**: But you've still got a long way to go until you can say you're truly famous. The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step, so keep at it!
- **10070**: Hello, <Player>. I've heard your name mentioned once or twice around these parts lately.
- **10071**: You're coming up in the world, but don't slow down now!
- **10072**: Oh, it's <Player>. Your name comes up quite a lot in conversation these days. You must be keeping busy out there.
- **10073**: Listening to the talk about you around the oasis just makes me swell up with pride. I know it's strange, but I love to hear about adventurers doing well in Rabao. Keep up the good work, <Player>.
- **10074**: Wow, <Player>! There's hardly a soul in all of Rabao who hasn't heard your name! I could hardly believe the stir you've been making.
- **10075**: You've entered the ranks of the truly great adventurers! But don't be content with your position; aim for the very top!
- **10076**: <Player>! Every time I speak with you, you seem to have gained in status. Pretty soon, I'm gonna have to start making appointments to talk to you!
- **10077**: There isn't a person in the whole of Rabao who hasn't heard of you. I never dreamed you would come so far!
- **10078**: Greetings, <Player>. Your endeavors in neighboring countries have reached us here in Rabao, and the glory of your reputation precedes you.
- **10079**: I feel honored to have known you before you became so famous. Good luck with your continuing adventurers!
- **10080**: Ah, <Player>. I've known you since you were just starting out around here, but to think you would go on to achieve such glory...
- **10081**: In Rabao and beyond, your name is on everyone's lips. It wouldn't be going too far to say you've achieved the status of hero in my eyes.
- **10082**: May the blessings of the Goddess Altana watch over your continuing endeavors.
