 9987: I am Alfesar, a friar from the San d'Oria Cathedral. I have come to study the Altepa Desert and its surroundings.
 9988: Until only recently, the monster-infested Korroloka Tunnel has been a barrier between the Quon continent and Zepwell Island. But with the clearing of that tunnel, I was able to make my way here.
 9989: On your way here to Rabao, I'm sure you saw the ruins of ages past half-buried in the sand. I have been given the task of investigating those ruins.
 9990: Several days ago, a researcher I hired brought back $6 inscribed with ancient writings. He found it in the expansive Quicksand Caves that lie beneath the Altepa Desert.
 9991: This was a major discovery. According to a scholar of ancient literature, the inscription on the tablet appears to be some kind of spell.
 9992: Unfortunately, with an important part of the tablet broken away, we were unable to decipher the full meaning.
 9993: I am still undergoing training and do not possess the ability to survive a foray into a place like the Quicksand Caves. And so, I turn to you.
 9994: <Player>, you are highly regarded as an accomplished adventurer. I wish to employ you to venture into the Quicksand Caves and find the remaining $3.
 9995: I humbly beg this favor of you.
 9996: The tablet I have was found in the Quicksand Caves that lie beneath the Altepa Desert. The $3 will most likely be among other rubble and debris.
 9997: Yes... This is, without a doubt, the $3.
 9998: Please take the completed $3 and this letter of introduction.
 9999: With these in your possession, go and meet with Charlaimagnat on the lower level of the San d'Oria Cathedral.
10000: Please hand this letter of introduction and the $3 to Charlaimagnat. He can be found on the lower level of the San d'Oria Cathedral.
10001: Ah, <Player>. I received a letter from Charlaimagnat informing me of the safe arrival of the $3. I am most grateful for your assistance.
10002: You have performed a great service for us. <Player>, may Paradise open its gates to you.
10003: Accepted Key Items: $3 and $3.
10004: The desert is crossed by all sorts of people, not just you adventurers. Like us caravan merchants, for instance.
10005: Sometimes we gotta dump our goods and run like hell when we get attacked by monsters out there. Your life is the most valuable thing ya got, pal.
10006: Some of the more nasty critters out there are those huge scorpions. They gotta be more'n twice my height, and naturally the sting in the tail'll shoot ya full of poison.
10007: Those scorpions are a real pain in the backside, if ya get my meaning. It's fine if ya happen to be best friends with a white mage, but out here you'll find more bruisers than healers. If ya don't got a good stock of antidotes, you're a dead man.
10008: 'Course, the main ingredient for that antidote just happens to be $1.
10009: An adventurer like yourself should see where I'm going with this. I want ya to go out and get me $1.
10010: Are ya up for it? [Leave it to me./Are ya crazy?]
10011: Oh, I really thought ya would've helped us out... Well, sorry for taking up ya time.
10012: Thanks, pal, you're a lifesaver! Now get out there, whack some of them scorpions, and bring me $1. I'll have ya reward waiting for ya.
10013: Oh, you again. I won't bore ya with a long speech. If ya feel up to getting us some $1, I'll be standing right here.
10014: Got me $1 yet? I took ya to be a competent adventurer, but don't go getting yourself killed out there.
10015: Ya got the $1! Now I can make me some antidote. Thanks, pal. Here's your reward, like I promised.
10016: If ya come across any more of the stuff, bring it to me, and I'll buy it off ya.
10017: Ya got me another $1! Can't have enough of this stuff. Take this for ya troubles.
10018: What the hell is this!? I asked ya to bring me $1. Get ya head out of the sand. Ya won't be getting a reward until ya bring me what I asked for.
10019: Hold on a minute. You're carrying too much stuff. Go sell or drop the junk ya don't need, then bring me the thing I asked for.
10020: Oh, you again. If ya come across any more $1, bring 'em to me and I'll buy 'em off ya.
10021: After going through all the trouble of drawing up the water for the oasis, the pioneers of this place stocked it with fish. You can't argue with that kind of thoroughness, hehehe.
10022: The Antica beastmen that make their homes here are covered in rigid plates. It's like they're born with a natural suit of armor.
10023: You won't be able to make a dent on them without a decent weapon. So saying, I still have to get a new sword, myself. Being a warrior can be so expensive...
10024: There's a cave system at the north edge of the Western Altepa Desert called the Kuftal Tunnel. Cape Teriggan lies at the other end of those caves.
10025: A few decades ago, you could easily travel from the cape further into the Quon continent. However, that path was lost when the land itself shifted during the Great War.
10026: Hey, did you know? The ruins that are buried beneath the desert in the Quicksand Caves were once a splendor-wendorous construction of the Galka.
10027: Long before either you or I were born, in an age when the Antica and the Galka waged war for dominance over the region, those buildings used to stand on the surface of the desert.
10028: And now they crumble below the shifting sands... Even as a Tarutaru, it gets me down. The home of an entire race, disappearing from the light of the sun...
10029: You see those windmills spinning atop the towers? They use the power of the wind to draw water up from deep beneath the earth.
10030: Even during the dry months, Rabao never lacks for water. Getting the water up to the surface originally must have been quite a feat, though.
10031: You should show your gratitude to the pioneers of this place. Why, my heart's about to burst from all the gratitude I'm feeling. Thank you, thank you, thank you...!
10032: From ages past, Zepwell Island has been treated as a forbidden land. The passages here from the mainland, the Gustav and Korroloka tunnels, have been inaccessible.
10033: But adventurers rarely heed words like "forbidden," now do they? You seem like one of those types.
10034: A group of like-minded people, avoiding the authorities from their countries, made their way to this island. They set up shop here, using this oasis as a base.
10035: This is Rabao, a town founded by adventurers.
10036: Hail, fellow adventurer. My name is Maryoh-Comyujah. I braved the long, arrrduous journey from the mainland to search for trrreasure in the Quicksand Caves.
10037: It's been a little harrrder than I expected, though. The Quicksand Caves are extensive and verrry confusing.
10038: On top of that, there are all these ant-type beastmen crawling around down there. Not a nice place to be looking for lost rrriches!
10039: The rrroad to hidden trrreasure is long indeed...
10040: You probably weren't aware of it, but this island is the lost homeland of the Galka... Even in these endless sands, the joy of setting foot in your homeland is a difficult emotion to express.
10041: Behold! The sign upon this arch proclaims the existence of the auction house beyond. A bounty of food and supplies in the center of the desert! What more could one ask for in this life?
10042: A little further north of here is the Rabao oasis. It's not much, but there are goods for sale in the tents.
10043: Outside of Rabao, the desert stretches for as far as the eye can see. Rabao is the only place to gather supplies for your journey and acts as a waypoint for adventurers. It's important for us to work together out here.
10044: Welcome, adventurer. This is Rabao, a precious oasis in the middle of the vast Altepa Desert. Take the chance to revitalize yourself before continuing on your journey.
10045: When your pack is fit to burrrst, send your non-essential items to your delivery box and bam, prrroblem solved!
10046: We can deliver goods to your residence or to the residences of your friends.
10047: Welcome to Rabao. My name is Cavalgrinne, and I'm in charge of the auction house services.
10048: There are no set prices in the auction house. Don't forget to check the price history when you make a bid or put an item up for sale.
10049: Browsing the auction house is free! Checking the goods for sale every day can turn up some truly wondrous items.
10050: Well met, adventurer. If you're looking for a weapon to carve through those desert beasts, you've come to the right place.
10051: For rainy days and windy days, or for days when someone tries to thrust a spear in your guts, having a good set of armor can set your mind at ease.
10052: These days, you can get weapons and armor cheap at the auction houses. But magic is expensive no matter where you go.
10053: No problem, Scamplix not bad guy. Scamplix is good guy, sells stuff to adventurers. Scamplix got lots of good stuff for you.

10062: For your own safety, it is recommended that you set this location as your home point after changing jobs.
10063: Huh? <Player>? Never heard that name before. Is that somebody famous? Oh, that's you?
10064: Hmm. I'm guessing you haven't been taking on many requests from people. You know, if you keep that up, no one is going to remember you.
10065: Even doing small favors is fine at first. If you help out a lot of different people, you'll slowly gain their trust. Before you know it, everyone will know your name.
10066: ...<Player>? I think I have some vague memory of hearing that name somewhere... Nope, it's gone.
10067: But this just goes to show how few people know you around here. You've gotta put yourself out there more, my young adventurer friend.
10068: Hm? <Player>? I've heard that name before. Seems you're building yourself a good reputation.
10069: But you've still got a long way to go until you can say you're truly famous. The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step, so keep at it!
10070: Hello, <Player>. I've heard your name mentioned once or twice around these parts lately.
10071: You're coming up in the world, but don't slow down now!
10072: Oh, it's <Player>. Your name comes up quite a lot in conversation these days. You must be keeping busy out there.
10073: Listening to the talk about you around the oasis just makes me swell up with pride. I know it's strange, but I love to hear about adventurers doing well in Rabao. Keep up the good work, <Player>.
10074: Wow, <Player>! There's hardly a soul in all of Rabao who hasn't heard your name! I could hardly believe the stir you've been making.
10075: You've entered the ranks of the truly great adventurers! But don't be content with your position; aim for the very top!
10076: <Player>! Every time I speak with you, you seem to have gained in status. Pretty soon, I'm gonna have to start making appointments to talk to you!
10077: There isn't a person in the whole of Rabao who hasn't heard of you. I never dreamed you would come so far!
10078: Greetings, <Player>. Your endeavors in neighboring countries have reached us here in Rabao, and the glory of your reputation precedes you.
10079: I feel honored to have known you before you became so famous. Good luck with your continuing adventurers!
10080: Ah, <Player>. I've known you since you were just starting out around here, but to think you would go on to achieve such glory...
10081: In Rabao and beyond, your name is on everyone's lips. It wouldn't be going too far to say you've achieved the status of hero in my eyes.
10082: May the blessings of the Goddess Altana watch over your continuing endeavors.
10083: Owzie-wowzie! Don't make me talk. I hurt all over!
10084: Try though you may, there will come a time when failure is inevitable.
10085: Channel that agony and bitterness into creating a new plan.
10086: Owzie-wowzie! Don't make me talk. I hurt all over!
10087: Hey! You're that famous adventurer, <Player>!
10088: Yippee! This is my lucky day!
10089: Let me introduce myself. I am from the Rhinostery in Windurst. I do research on various living things.
10090: And I'm the besty-westy they've got! I've been looking into phenomena at a certain place.
10091: What phenomena, you ask? Well, there are these giant crystals, you see! And from those crystals, a strangey-wangey power is constantly pouring forth...
10092: These crystals are found all over Vana'diel, and their energies affect the surrounding ecosystems. Our research team had been investigating the unusual emanations when...
10093: Guess what!
10094: We finally succeeded in awakening the crystals!
10095: Our theory on what lay dormant inside the crystals was proven to be rightaru on the money! Except they didn't appreciate being woken up... We were attacked... We were bested-wested...
10096: Why do they so despise talking with us that they would rather fight? And what on Vana'diel would happen if someone were to defeat them?
10097: I bet you could do it! You call yourself an adventurer, right? Give it a shot!
10098: Take up the challenge? [Bring it on!/Ah, no, thanks...]
10099: Great! Here, take this $3. But be warned--only a person who carries one can enter the crystal.
10100: This $3 will awaken the giant crystal that is found [in Ifrit's Cauldron/in the Quicksand Caves/in the Den of Rancor/in Cape Teriggan/in Fei'Yin/in The Boyahda Tree].
10101: Without it, you won't be getting inside no matter how sneaky-weaky you are! Oh, and if you want to take some friends with you, they also have to get $6 from me. Okey-dokey?
10102: If you don't prepare yourself for battle, you'll get beaten to a pulp, like we did!
10103: As soon as we gather our companions, we'll be jumping into the fray again. I just hope this little researcher doesn't get in our way...
10104: What nonsense! If I don't go with you, there's no pointaru to the research now, is there?
10105: How'd it go!? Wowy-wow-wow! You defeated a prime avatar!
10106: ...I see. The prime avatar said that to you? I wonder what it could mean.
10107: ...There is no need to understand... ...You will forget what I have said...
10108: Y-you, you're...!
10109: ...You have power...
10110: ...Will you allow...that power... ...to slumber...for eternity...?
10111: Surrender...that power...to me... and I...will craft...that power... into whatever...you desire...
10112: ...We meet...again...
10113: ...My charge...must...be...fulfilled...
10114: The beast...will claim...its due...
10115: Choose... What...do you desire...? What...do you seek?
10116: What do you desire? [$5./$6./$1./$2./Gil./Nothing (a pact with the avatar).]
10117: ...This is what you desire...?
10118: You want $5? [Yes./Wait!]
10119: You want $6? [Yes./Wait!]
10120: You want $2? [Yes./Wait!]
10121: You want $1? [Yes./Wait!]
10122: Gil is what you truly want? [Yes./Wait!]
10123: Are you sure? [Yes./Wait!]
10124: Listen...to the voice without--my voice--with your ears...and your heart...
10125: Bring me... Power... Higher... Deeper... ...... Stronger...
10126: ...? ...something...interfering...?
10127: <Player>...! Listen to the voice within you!
10128: If you focus, you will see the true Vana'diel!
10129: ...Even if...that...
10130: Uh? Huh? I went all spacey-wacey for a moment there...
10131: Um, who were you again? Was I speaking with you? What were we talking about?
10132: Did I tell you I'm a researcher from the Rhinostery in Windurst already?
10133: You are now able to summon [Ifrit/Titan/Leviathan/Garuda/Shiva/Ramuh].
10134: Huh? What? Do I know where Ildy-Goldy is?
10135: Yeah, you justaru missed him. He went off towards Cape Terrrigan with the improved tuning fork of air.
10136: Ildy-Goldy will wipe the floor with that avatar. I wonder what kind of research data he'll bring back for us?
10137: Hm? Did he seem a little different from usual?
10138: Well, now that you mention it, he did ask me to give this to any adventurers that came looking for him...
10139: I guess that must mean you. Here you go. Seems like a clear invitation to go take on the avatar in Cape Teriggan yourself.
10140: I've given you what Ildy-Goldy had me hold on to. You should be on your way to Cape Teriggan.
10141: ...Hm? You're going to help out Ildy-Goldy, but first you want to take on the avatar in Cape Teriggan under your own steam?
10142: Check it out yourself? [I like to do things my way.../All on my lonesome...?]
10143: ...You got guts, kid. Well, either way is fine with me.
10144: What!? You lost the $1!?
10145: What kind of an adventurer are you...? Well, don't go losing this one, okay?
10146: ...We m-m-meet again... ...There is no need for violence, adventurer...
10147: ...I just wish to ask you som-m-me questions. ...Why do you think the avatars...give power to people...without a reason...?
10148: ..And...have you...felt the power...of the avatars...?
10149: Hahaha... ...Rather than strength without purpose... ...you should be seeking...true power...
10150: We m-m-meet...again... I must...fulfill...my charge.
10151: You must...seek power...
10152: ...And I...shall c-c-claim...my due...
10153: What? You want another $3?
10154: Oh, all right... But be careful-wareful with this one! These things don't grow on star trees, you know.
10155: Hmmm... Hrmmm... So it's time to use...no...
10156: Hello? You're an adventurer, right? Maybe you can help us out.
10157: Let me introduce myself and my companion. We're from the Rhinostery in Windurst.
10158: I was hired by the ministry to accompany this researcher to [Ifrit's Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei'Yin/the Boyahda Tree] and assist him in his study of a series of giant crystals.
10159: But what was waiting for us inside those crystals was more than I could deal with...
10160: We tried countless times, but I could not defeat that beast. Another researcher at the Rhinostery sympathized with our plight and developed an improved tuning fork.
10161: No no no no no! That crazy-wazy contraption won't provide us with any useful data!
10162: Listen, muscle-hussle brain. Science is not about winning or spinning, life or strife, even or Steven! It's a more delicate subjectaru!
10163: Do you see what I have to deal with? I don't know how much longer I can work with such a pessimist.
10164: That's where you come in. I was thinking of letting one of you adventurers test out the new fork and prove to my colleague that it is able to return data valuable to his research.
10165: No no no no no! Even if they use that half-rate spork, it'll take a tip-top summoner to defeat the prime avatar!
10166: Listen up. The fandangled $1 won't make it any easier for you to downright defeat the monster inside the crystal. Sure, it'll lower the power of the prime avatar to around $3, but it will do the same to you! And on top of that, you'll only be able to summon that itty-bitty blue bugger, Carbuncle!
10167: And to make things worse, nobody-buddy else can enter the crystal with you! You'll be battling one-on-one, man-to-man, Taru-et-Taru!
10168: ... Yes, but sir... The Rhinostery has been pressing us to produce results. If we do not take some sort of action quickly...
10169: Hmmm... You do have a point there... I guess one round with a prime avatar wouldn't hurtaru.
10170: No, one round could not hurt.
10171: You know that you probably won't gain anything from this battle-waddle. Are you sure you still want the fork?
10172: Are you really-dilly sure? [Fork me!/On second thought...]
10173: Well, you asked for it! Take this $1 and ring it near one of those giant crystals. The prime avatar won't be slap-happy to be woken up, and you'll have to deal with its wrath.
10174: I guess because you are helping us check out this new tuning fork, I can use my mighty-minty magic to warp you near the giant crystal in [Ifrit's Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei'Yin/the Boyahda Tree]. When you're ready, just show my companion the $1.
10175: The researcher who made the $1 warned that "the door home would only open to those who defeated the prime avatar."
10176: I'm not quite sure what that is supposed to mean, but I suggest that you prepare well before taking on this journey. Remember, you have to be at least a level $3 summoner.
10177: Are you and Carbuncle ready to fight the prime avatar as a level $3 summoner?
10178: Also, regardless of whether you defeat the avatar or not, you will be unable to re-enter the protocrystal again for a number of days.
10179: Are you sure you are ready? [Off to [Ifrit's Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei'Yin/the Boyahda Tree]!/My dog ate my mini tuning fork./Not just yet...]
10180: Sir, our adventurer has completed [his/her] preparations and requests a warp.
10181: ... Abracadoodle-strudel-poodle... ...
10182: Sha-mone!
10183: Don't use that excuse on me, [young man/young lady]. If you want another $1, all you have to do ask.
10184: If you do not bring the $1 we gave you, my companion cannot warp you to [Ifrit's Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei'Yin/the Boyahda Tree].
10185: Did you remember to bring the $1?
10186: What!? You defeated the prime avatar!?
10187: Sir!
10188: Hmmm... Just as I thoughtaru. The prime avatar that you fought with this spunky-junky tuning fork was nothing but a fake. Researching real avatars with real tuning forks is how real researchers do real research in the real world!
10189: ... Sir...
10190: ... (Now if I could only find me some real work so I could do some real adventuring...)
10191: I don't think you'll get much out of it, but if you want to go get your buttaru kicked by the prime avatar again, all you have to do is ring another $1 near a giant crystal.
10192: Remember that you must fight the prime avatar as a level $3 summoner. As you already know, this will not be an easy task. Prepare well for the battle.
10193: Do you want another mini tuning fork? [Fork me baby, one more time./Stick a fork in me, I'm done.]
10194: Hey! You're that famous adventurer, <Player>!
10195: Maybe you can help us outaru!
10196: Let me introduce myself. I am from the Rhinostery in Windurst. I do research on various living things.
10197: You already-weddy know about the super-giant crystals, rightaru?
10198: These crystals are found all over Vana'diel, and their energies affect the surrounding ecosystems. Our research team had been investigating the unusual emanations when POOF, out of nowhere, a prime avatar appeared and sliced 'n diced us down to size.
10199: Why do these avatars so despise talking with us that they would rather fight? And what on Vana'diel would happen if someone were to defeat them?
10200: You were able to handle one all by yourself. You should have no problem defeating one with your buddy-wuddies. You'll help us out, right?
10201: Ahem, now let me introduce myself...
10202: Ah, you are back. How was your battle with the avatar?
10203: Remember, the protocrystals will only resonate with the tuning forks ever so often. Use this time to rest before taking upon another challenge.
10204: I'm a traveling moogle, kupo. I help adventurers in the Outlands access items they have stored in a Mog House elsewhere, kupo.
10205: This isn't a Mog House, so you can only use the "Mog Safe," "Change Jobs," and "Delivery Box" commands, kupo.
10206: You have to pay fee of $0 gil to transfer your items to the Outlands, kupo. Why? Because the world is a cold place for rogue moogles, kupo.
10207: Of course, you can move your items back to your Mog House in town, but if you want to transfer them to the Outlands again, you'll have to pay another fee, kupo. I've got to make a living too, kupo.
10208: Transfer items? (Current gil:$1) [Pay $0 gil./Don't transfer items.]
10209: You don't have enough gil, kupo.
10210: Item transfer complete, kupo.
10211: $2 , $3
10212: There must be a way to make a quick gil in this untouched territory...
10213: Hey [buddy/lady], I got a proposition for you. I'm trying to start up a new business in this area. I'm gonna call it..."Kuftal Tourist Services"!
10214: I'm planning a tour that will take people to all the mysterious places that can be found on Zepwell Island...
10215: But first, I'm gonna need someone to scope out the area for me and... What? You say you've heard this spiel before? Well, just bear with me.
10216: So's I can show you don't have to be a high-level adventurer to enjoy this tour, I want you to party with only people level forty or below. Then, head to the cliff that's just inside the entrance to the Kuftal Tunnel.
10217: You should meet my partner there--goes by the name of Hawk Nose.
10218: Huh? It's definitely not a place for sightseeing? That's weird. I'd heard the Galka consider it to be a place of legend...
10219: I was trying to imitate my sister's business in Bastok, but things just don't seem to be working out.
10220: Well, when I find a new place for my tour, I'll call on your services again. Here's your fee.
10221: Things of substance will inevitably be destroyed. There comes a time when even the most resilient spirit will be broken...
10222: Hmm, you seem to have broken your $7...
10223: It is possible to repair it with synthesis, but there is the chance that the attempt will end in failure.
10224: If you prefer a definite method of restoring your $7, then bring to me $6, $5, and two $4.
10225: A spirit that has overcome a crushing defeat can be said to have the true heart of an angler...
10226: Aha! You have done well in bringing me all that is required. Now, I shall return to you your cherished $7!
10227: If you wish to ride a chocobo, you must possess $6 and have a high enough job level.
10228: You can rent a chocobo for $0 gil. I see you currently have $1 gil.
10229: You can rent a chocobo, but because your level is so low, you won't be able to ride for very long. Also, equipment that extends your riding time will have no effect.
10230: If you still want one, it will cost you $0 gil. I see you currently have $1 gil.
10231: Do you wish to rent a chocobo? [Yes, I do./No, thank you.]
10232: You don't have enough gil.
10233: You cannot obtain the $0. Come back after sorting your inventory.
10234: Would you be so kind as to deliver her to [the entrance to the Gustav Tunnel (B-8)/Bibiki Bay (G-10)/the entrance of Uggalepih Temple (J-11)]?
10235: Only those fulfilling both requirements set forth by the alliance may ride a chocobo. First, you must be a soldier of a respectable level in the Allied Forces. Secondly, you must be in possession of $6.
10236: Any of our fine birds here will bear you directly to the frontlines of battle. We charge a service fee of $0 Allied Notes, which goes towards seeing that the chocobos are well taken care of. My records indicate that you currently have $1 Allied Notes.
10237: Hmmm... It looks like you don't have enough Allied Notes. Sorry, but these birds aren't going to feed and groom themselves.
10238: I'm sorry, but we don't put our chocobos in the hands of people with $6. We wouldn't want our feathered friends dying from fright now, would we?
10239: Ho there! Aren't you the adventurer known as <Player>? The winds carry word of your interest in the ruins of Li'Telor.
10240: I know how to get in. Into the very center of the rrruins, I mean. I wouldn't mind just telling you, but...you know what they say, "Nothing of value should come for free."
10241: I have a little favor to ask. Underneath the Altepa Desert lie the expansive Quicksand Caves. I've got a hunch that there's some undiscovered trrreasure in there, still waiting to be claimed.
10242: Just head a short way into the caves and pick up anything that strrrikes you as valuable. If I like what you brrring me, I'll tell you everything I know about the rrruins.
10243: Not a bad deal, rrright? You scrrratch my back, and I'll scrrratch yours.
10244: What's up? You changed your mind?
10245: Do a deal with Maryoh Comyujah? [Sounds fair./I can scratch my own back.]
10246: Okay then, it's a deal. The Quicksand Caves are expansive and have many entrances, but I'm sure you'll figure them out.
10247: What, you don't trrrust me? Well, I'll be arrround here for a while, so come on back if you change your mind.
10248: My hunter's instinct tells me that there's something unusual beyond that weight-operated device in the caves.
10249: Wow, this is incrrredible!
10250: Now listen carefully, and I'll tell you what I know about the rrruins, just like I prrromised.
10251: What I'm about to tell you happened long before I came to Kuzotz. I went alone to explore Li'Telor, a place that has been known as a holy land since ancient times.
10252: I was traveling through a dense fog and, though it embarrasses me to rrrecall, completely lost my way. After wandering for a time, I somehow found myself at the rrruins.
10253: What I saw there, you already know. Those huge statues facing one another in that great hall, and beyond... The immovable wall that bars the way into the heart of the rrruins.
10254: I searched every inch of that place. And then I found it. A mysterrrious crystal glowing with a clear, blue light.
10255: I don't know why it was there, but it was shining from below the surface of the lake in the great hall. ...Glowing as if in rrresponse to the moonlight that poured in from above.
10256: This is that $3. I brought it back with me thinking I could sell it, but I haven't been able to find a buyer. I might as well give it to you.
10257: Place it into the hollow in the center of that wall and see what happens for yourself. You wouldn't want me to spoil it for you now, would you? Hehehe.
10258: Those rrruins in Li'Telor are interesting to visit on a night of the full moon. You learn anew that there are still many things in this world that are beyond our understanding.
10259: Ho, <Player>. What did you see? There's nothing in there, rrright? I already knew that, though... Huh? You saw a floating island in there?
10260: Haha, nice try. If you're gonna make something up, try for something a little more believable. There's nothing at the top of those stairs besides that altar.
10261: A wonderful place, this Rabao. Away from the bustle of the modern world, one can sit back and relax. Now this is true freedom.
10262: You are the ninja that found the $3, am I right? So, your journey has finally brought you here...
10263: My name is Leodarion, grandson of Mitsunari the Poisonclaw. Oh, he was not my real grandfather. He found me lying beneath a cactus when I was still a baby, and took me in.
10264: I see that you were able to get by my little spider trap...
10265: Hey, don't go getting all upset, now. You're still alive, aren't you? If it was one of my grandfather's, though, you would've ended up like that Yomi.
10266: That trap was what he left to the world before he passed away. That trap and his treasure...
10267: What a way to go out! Now I'm studying his journal, trying to become as skilled as he was.
10268: The other day, while looking through that journal, I found an even greater trap. A trap that calls forth the spirit of the dead.
10269: I think that my grandfather left me these clues to try to tell me something, but I'm not sure that I can do this by myself.
10270: You're working for Norg, right? Why don't you lend me a hand? Don't worry. I'll pay you nicely.
10271: To call forth the spirit in my grandfather's trap, the diary says I need $6. If you're interested in my offer, I'll be waiting here for you.
10272: To call forth the spirit in my grandfather's trap, the diary says I need $6. If you're interested in my offer, I'll be waiting here for you.
10273: Oh, this is the $6 that my grandfather talked about in his journal. Now I can complete the trap! Come back tomorrow, and I'll show you the result.
10274: Now I can complete my grandfather's trap! Come back tomorrow, and I'll show you the result.
10275: Here it is, $6. With this, I can finally call forth the spirit and complete my grandfather's work.
10276: According to my grandfather's journal, if you "carry the seance staff with you while traveling at night from east to west over the Bastore Sea, you will most certainly face your greatest fears..."
10277: Here, you take this and see if it works. What? Do you think a guy like me could handle any evil spirits?
10278: I bet that the spirit is carrying some great treasure that my grandfather left behind...
10279: I just don't understand... What did my grandfather mean by "leaving me his memories"?
10280: What? You've found $6 of my grandfather's?
10281: Really? May I see it!?
10282: Putting this here like this... And fastening this like this... I would have never thought...
10283: Yeah, yeah. Enough of the small talk. Are you going to open it, or what?
10284: Who are you?
10285: Name's Ryoma. I hired <Player> to open this box for me, but when it comes to treasure, I don't take any chances. I tagged along...just in case.
10286: No offense there, <Player>. Now, let's see what's inside. I've been waiting a long time for this day.
10287: Be careful, there...
10288: There. It's open.
10289: That was easy... Well, what do we have?
10290: It's empty... There is nothing inside.
10291: It can't be! Where's the treasure!?
10292: Look for yourself. You won't find any treasure inside, because the box itself is the real treasure. Only a true master could craft such a fine work of art...
10293: Yes, it might have been easy to open, but I do not know if I will ever be able to copy what my grandfather has done.
10294: You'd better not be trying to pull a fast one, Leodarion. If I find out you're hiding any treasure from me...
10295: Unless you cannot see the box in front of you, Uncle Ryoma, the only treasure is there in Leodarion's hands.
10296: Ayaya...? Ayaya! What are you doing here?
10297: It is unfortunate that we must meet again under these circumstances, Uncle.
10298: I have been assigned by the Bastok government as the head of foreign policy relating to Norg. This includes observation of its members' actions...
10299: You mean...you've been watching me this whole time?
10300: I was just following my orders. When we learned that the members of Norg were once again searching for a lost treasure, I had no choice but to follow you here to gather information.
10301: So, you really are a Musketeer...
10302: Mister...Leodarion. I have heard your story from my father. I feel that I, too, know the true value of that treasure you hold.
10303: Wait... You're Yomi's daughter, aren't you? Yes, I finally think I know what my grandfather was trying to say in his will...
10304: A piece of that person lives on in everything a true master leaves behind. I can feel it whenever I see my mother's blade, just as you can with that box.
10305: I feel it even more when I see how that blade affects the lives of the people around it.
10306: Because of the message that my mother left for me within that blade, I was able to find my own path in life. That path led me to Norg.
10307: I see. As much as we try to follow in someone's footsteps, there are places that we will never reach. That is why we must concentrate on finding our own paths.
10308: Exactly. Uncle, would it be too much to ask to let Mister Leodarion keep his grandfather's box?
10309: Too much to ask? Who needs a dirty old empty box, anyway!? What a waste of time!
10310: Oh, and tell your good-for-nothing father to make sure that Kaede comes out to be a little more "understanding" than her sister!
10311: I will be sure to tell him, though I cannot guarantee that Kaede will grow up to be like my mother.
10312: Farewell.
10313: Wait! I think this box may hold a hint into opening my grandfather's $3. I used to try when I was a child, but I never could.
10314: Maybe there is a treasure in there...
10315: I am going to forget what you just told me. I am not a pirate nor a treasure hunter. I have no interest in what lies in that $3. If you need assistance, try asking this adventurer.
10316: Wow...
10317: Anyway. I'm grateful for all you've done for me. That's why I'm going to let you in on my secret.
10318: Long ago, my grandfather hid his $3 inside a treasure chest deep within the Kuftal Tunnel. After looking at this $3, I think I can open it now.
10319: If you bring it to me, I'll give you whatever's inside. What do you say?
10320: You've brought back the $3! Here, let me see if I can open it.
10321: Yes. I knew I could do it! Here, take what was inside. My grandfather would have wanted you to have it.
10322: Ho there! I am called Generoit. I have everything here for the chocobo enthusiast, and other rare items galore.
10323: Fireworks! Tenshodo fireworks! No refunds for blowey-woeing your hands off!
10324: Hey, [mister/lady]. You look like you could use some extra cash, and what easier way to get gil than by making a date with Lady Luck?
10325: Give "Lucky Roll" a try? [Luck be a lady tonight!/I'm not throwing my money away!/Fill me in on the details.]
10326: Let me explain to you how it works. One game of Lucky Roll is played each Vana'diel day.
10327: One play is 100 gil, but as long as you keep paying, you can keep playing.
10328: For each 100 gil, you get one roll of our six-sided die. The number that appears is added to the running total for that day.
10329: The lucky adventurer who rolls the die that gets the running total over 400 wins...get this...a whopping 10000 gil!
10330: And that's not all! You'll receive extra prizes if the total comes to 401 or 402, and a super bonus prize if your roll brings the total to exactly 400!
10331: But be careful; the only time you can find out the running total is after you have rolled.
10332: And that's it! Pretty simple, huh? You can attack from the get go, or you can sit back while other people roll, and then come in for the final kill. We provide you with the die, you choose the strategy.
10333: Alright, enough talk, let's get rolling!
10334: You rolled a...$1! The running total is now $3!
10335: Congratulations! Lady Luck has smiled on you today! Here's your 10000 gil!
10336: And because your roll put the running total at exactly 400, you receive a bonus prize!
10337: And for bringing the total so close to 400, here is your extra prize!
10338: I'm sorry, but that's it for today's game of Lucky Roll. Come by tomorrow, and maybe Lady Luck will be waiting for you!
10339: The minstrel of melodies is my name, For a mere $6 gil I'll recall your past. Your stories of love, anger, triumph, and shame, The river of memories runs deep and vast.
10340: The minstrel of melodies is my name, For a mere $6 gil I'd recall your past. But I find that you're lacking in cash or in fame, So until that time, my kind offer will last.
10341: Now close your eyes...
10342: Which memory will you have recalled? [Nothing./Zilart Missions./Rabao Quests./Other Quests./Foreign Missions.]
10343: Which memory will you have recalled? [Nothing./The Mithra and the Crystal.]
10344: Which memory will you have recalled?

10346: Which memory will you have recalled? [Nothing./The Salt of the Earth(pt.1)./The Salt of the Earth(pt.2).]
10347: I've been sent here on business. A nice place this Rabao is.
10348: Wait, you must be the adventurer that has been sent to aid me in the investigation.
10349: According to my research, the $3 that the senator requires is only found in one place.
10350: And that would be the Gustav Tunnel...am I right?
10351: Who are you...?
10352: He accompanied me, but that is a long story.
10353: Sir Iron Eater!
10354: I told you I knew where it was. I remember Werei talking about it years ago.
10355: There is an old Galkan legend that tells of our people setting off on journeys to find this $3 and postpone their rebirth.
10356: But what is more interesting is this: There is a theory that states the Galkan journey of rebirth originated from this journey to collect $3.
10357: Now even I don't believe that, but there may be some connection between this obsession with rocksalt and the Galka's long history of mineworking.
10358: So the reason that you joined me on this mission was to learn more of the $3's role in Galkan legend...
10359: ...and to learn more of Werei's journey. You knew that he would want to learn more of the legend before he...
10360: While on his journey, Werei...left many clues behind for us. The message that we found earlier was probably the last.
10361: But I'm not satisfied with what he left, and I'm not giving up until I find out what really happened to him.
10362: Gumbah...
10363: Oh, and there is one more reason why I stuck my nose into this mission, but that's still a secret. If everything goes as planned, you'll see what I mean.
10364: I'm sorry, Mister Dancing Wolf. Please tell the adventurer what [he/she] needs to know.
10365: The $3 that we are looking for only appears in the Gustav Tunnel where freshwater and saltwater mix.
10366: However, that cave is filled with hideous beasts. I would get killed if I even tried getting close.
10367: I see... Then the senator was correct when saying that it would be dangerous to send an inexperienced adventurer.
10368: If you happen to find the $3, bring it to me before you return to Bastok. I'm required to write a report of your findings.
10369: Oh, I'm glad to see you back here in one piece. So this is the $3?
10370: Hmmm... You know, it looks a lot like that...
10371: It looks a lot like what?
10372: What did you see, Mister Dancing Wolf?
10373: One day when I was doing my research on $3, I met a strange Galkan child.
10374: An adventurer said she found the boy wandering about the desert carrying something that closely resembled $3.
10375: The boy had no memory of how he had gotten there, so we all assumed that he must have been on his way back from his journey of rebirth.
10376: Wait, there he is, over there.
10377: Th-that's...
10378: Gumbah, what's wrong?
10379: That's impossible... He couldn't have returned so quickly...
10380: He... He looks the same as he did when we played together...two hundred years ago...
10381: Werei!
10382: What!?
10383: Werei? Did you just call me Werei? That's strange...
10384: That name sounds so familiar... Hey, what's your name?
10385: Gumbah...
10386: Gumbah? Now that's a weird name.
10387: You...don't remember?
10388: Remember? Remember what?
10389: I've gotta go. The caravan that I've been traveling with is about to set off.
10390: Always on the road... Never settling down... Now that's the life for me.
10391: Well, I'm off. That name you called me--Warai--I liked it.
10392: Werei...
10393: Yeah, yeah. That was it. Werei...
10394: I'll be seeing you around, Gumbah.
10395: Hey, why do you look so down? You should try smiling a little more, got it? Well, bye!
10396: Gumbah... Was that what I thought it was...?
10397: Who does he think he is, shooting his mouth off at me like that...
10398: But I guess I can't blame him. It was my fault that he was forced to live such a hard life...
10399: So he was the real Werei...?
10400: I don't know, Iron Eater...
10401: I never thought that this simple $3 could bring about such a miracle.
10402: On the other hand, it could have been that the two just simply looked alike...
10403: But I guess that is something we will never know. Not even a Talekeeper can remember his rebirth, so chasing after the memory of it would be foolish...
10404: I guess some things are better left unknown.
10405: Gumbah...
10406: A Galka named Werei has set out on his journey of life...
10407: Isn't that enough?
10408: Excellent work, <Player>. Not only have you finished your work here, but you have also given us the opportunity to meet someone special.
10409: But your mission is not complete. Take the $3 back to the senator. We'll see what Gumbah has in store for him.
10410: Hurry the $3 back to the senator. I will send the report later by chocobo.
10411: Goldfish... Goldfish...something...
10412: Scoop fish...get...something...
10413: More exciting than...whatever... Goldfish...something...
10414: Yeah...? [I want to buy a scoop./Tell me how to play./I'm ready for my prize./I'd like a bowl.]
10415: Whatever...
10416: Uh-huh...
10417: <Sigh> I must have explained this a hundred times today...
10418: And you want to know... [How to scoop./About the types of goldfish./About the prizes./What's eating you.]
10419: # in your Range slot... $1 in your Ammo slot... Find water and fish...or something...
10420: Goldfish only found in areas with...fireworks displays...or whatever...
10421: Three...or so types: $0, $1, and $2...
10422: %...tiny, red...easy to catch...probably... Worth...I don't know...a point...
10423: $1...fat...ugly...like me... Two points...or so...
10424: $2...big... Break your...scoop thingy...or not... Maybe...ten points...or whatever...
10425: There are...other types...maybe... Catch them...for bonus points...probably...
10426: Scoop fish...trade them to me... I give you...points...or something. Use points to buy...stuff...
10427: Six...or so types of prizes... Use your points...or whatever...
10428: $0 points gets you a new $1... Whoopee...
10429: $0 points for...bag of something... I don't know...fireworks, maybe...
10430: $0 points buys...assorted drop... I think...
10431: Fan thingies...cool down for...$0 points...
10432: $0 points gets you...whatever's in the mystery box...or whatever... It's probably just some piece of junk...or something...
10433: Buy scoops... Scoop fish... Get points... Win cheap prizes... Buy more scoops... Pure excitement...
10434: So...are you going to play...or what? It's not like I'm going anywhere, though...
10435: Huh...? Oh...here... Take this $0... Don't lose it...or anything...
10436: Lost your $0...? Whatever...
10437: You can have a new one... You'll lose your points...like I care...
10438: Well...? [I'm...not sure.../Whatever...hand it over...]
10439: Yeah...okay...
10440: It's your life... Here's your new $0...
10441: Can't give you another...bowl thing...unless you want your points reset to zero...
10442: Zero points it is...
10443: You have $0 or so point[/s]... [$1: $2./A bag of fireworks: $3./Large fans: $6./A colored drop: $4./1 $11: $1./The mystery box: $5./A stellar surprise: $9./The other mystery box: $7./Yet another mystery box: $8./Mystery box part four: $10./Nothing.]
10444: Ummm... Need more points...or something...
10445: Are you sure...and everything...?
10446: And everything? [Just...forget it.../Get me my stuff...or whatever...]
10447: Here... Are you done...?
10448: Okay... Are you done...?
10449: Oh boy... Counting goldfish...
10450: Hm... I don't know...$0 point[/s]...?
10451: Hmmm... $0 point[/s]...maybe?
10452: <Sigh> It's going to take me forever to count all these... ...... $0 point[/s]...or so...
10453: Not very good at this, huh... Like I care or anything...
10454: Are you still here...?
10455: Hey... Do you like fish...or something?
10456: <Player>'s point total is now $0.
10457: % sighs softly...or whatever...
10458: <Player>'s point total is now $0.
10459: HANBAI! BANZAI! SUSHI! SAMURAI!
10460: You cannot accumulate any more points.
10461: Wait... Two more...boxes... Don't know what's in them...don't care, either... One for $0 stupid point[/s]...the other for $1...or whatever...
10462: Oh...look. For $0 point thing[/s] you can get something new called...the Summer Splash... Wow... Doesn't that sound so terribly...<yawn>...exciting?
10463: Oh...and this year, $0 of those point-whatevers will get you...a stellar surprise or something... I don't know why we bother with surprises... It's just going to be a...<yawn>...disappointment in the end, I'm sure... <Sigh>...
10464: And what is this!? For $0 you can lands yourself an incredibly goregous happi!? Why did we wait so long to put this festival feature on the shelves!?
10465: ;j)g$30p$295D1jE7$4981320E$4719146"F+` h\7I
10466: This box needs to go in with that San d'Orian shipment. And this one... Dammit, where's my list?
10467: Oh, and a fine day to you, adventurer. Rudolfo of the Rabao "If it don't get there overnight, wait" Freight Company, at your service.
10468: Sanctia! Sanctia`!
10469: Mister Rudolfo, you haven't seen my Sanctia anywhere, have you?
10470: Since it's payday and all, I wanted to give her a late birthday present. I can't find her anywhere...
10471: Well, I been lookin' for you, Chelvadurai.
10472: If you got any spare cash floatin' around, how's about paying me back that ten thousand gil you borrowed?
10473: Leave off, Jeisson. Sanctia's armor has been hangin' by a thread for months.
10474: You can't expect her to haul cargo across the desert in nothin' more than a pair of boots an' a smile.
10475: But a man should pay his debts, am I right?
10476: You were chased out of the last town 'cos of money troubles, and still you hand over bags of gil to that Lucky Roll guy...
10477: Can't argue with you there. I have no excuses at all.
10478: We all know what it's like to trudge around the Outlands on this pitiful wage, and Lucky Roll's the only entertainment we get out here. But you got a wife and baby back home, right?
10479: You should be sending every spare coin to your family, not borrowing more for fun and games.
10480: You're right, you're exactly right. What was I thinking?
10481: Alright, enough talk, you lot.
10482: Is the next shipment ready to go? What am I paying you for? Get back to work.
10483: By the way, Chelvadurai. I gave you the day off to celebrate your daughter's birthday...
10484: But just because she's not around doesn't mean you can take tomorrow off, as well. I'm trying to run a business here, you understand?
10485: Yes, sir. I understand.
10486: ...You don't think she's run off, do you?
10487: I mean, you could work the rest of your life and not pay back those loans by yourself.
10488: Sanctia still has a good thirty years of labor in her, which would be just enough for getting those debts off your back.
10489: And I'm sure she's well aware of that fact by now.
10490: Do you really think she's left me behind...?
10491: Probably for the best, I say. There's something not quite right with that girl.
10492: My guess is she's gone to look for Tavnazia after soaking up all of Zoriboh's fairy tales about the place.
10493: ...
10494: Sanctia...
10495: Have you finally lost patience with your old man...?
10496: Looks like one of the cargo haulers has gone missing. I wonder if she just got fed up and left?
10497: Sanctia has always been a daydreamer, though. Heard too many of Zoriboh's bedtime stories and got restless, I'd wager.
10498: You say little Sanctia has gone missing?
10499: Don't tell me she's taken to heart those stories I heard in Norg...
10500: You've gotta find her for me, adventurer.
10501: If what you say is true, she's probably headed for the lost nation of Tavnazia.
10502: That means she'll be in Norg, looking for a ship to take her to the Marquisate.
10503: That place is a haven for the worst kind of pirates and thieves. I can't bear to think what would happen to innocent little Sanctia in there...
10504: You've gotta get there before anything happens to her. I'll pay you myself if I have to, but please hurry!
10505: I've seen my fair share of towns, but Rabao is where I feel most comfortable.
10506: I don't know if it's my Galkan blood speaking, or just the soft whisper of the desert sands, but this place just says "home" to me.
10507: She's where!? I can't believe little Sanctia made it to the Tavnazian Archipelago all by herself. So, she's planning to become a bounty hunter...
10508: This is all my fault. I never should've filled her head with all those stories of adventure.
10509: I told Sanctia of two famous bounty hunters: Goldmane of Tavnazia, and Ismenios Cutsilver of Bastok...
10510: This pair left their mark on Vana'diel's history with the great deeds they performed twenty years ago.
10511: They are best remembered for capturing the notorious leader of Atarefaunet's Band and handing him over to the San d'Orian government.
10512: The sum they received for Atarefaunet's capture was said to have been unbelievably huge.
10513: Sanctia is probably planning to apprentice herself to Goldmane and make her fortune as a bounty hunter.
10514: I hate to admit it, but her father's debts would be impossible to pay back with any normal wage...
10515: Anyway, I'm relieved to hear she's not alone on her travels.
10516: That moogle has been on the road before and knows which places to avoid.
10517: That good-for-nothing Chelvadurai. His gambling habits are to blame for all this.
10518: I'll tell him about his daughter myself. Here, you've done your part.
10519: I'll let Chelvadurai know what happened to his daughter.
10520: And I'll also give him an earful about kicking his gambling habits.
10521: Sanctia still hasn't returned to Rabao!?
10522: Her father said he would hire the services of an adventurer, but I wonder if he even knows how to go about it?
10523: Zoriboh mentioned he knew the perfect adventurer for the job, though...
10524: <Player>, I need your help again.
10525: Sanctia hasn't come back from Tavnazia, and her father and I are worried.
10526: She must still be looking for Goldmane, the bounty hunter I told you about.
10527: I want you to follow Sanctia and keep her out of trouble until she either finds him or gives up on her search.
10528: What do you say? [I'll do it./I don't have time for babysitting.]
10529: I know she's a handful, but you'll be well paid for your efforts.
10530: Oh, and give this to Sanctia when you find her.
10531: Chelvadurai wanted her to have it for her birthday.
10532: Bring her back safe.
10533: Too busy with your adventures to help anyone, huh?
10534: Little Sanctia has become an adventurer!?
10535: So Goldmane convinced her that was the best path... Well, he'd be about the only person she'd listen to.
10536: By the way, did you remember to give Sanctia the package from her father?
10537: Mister Zoriboh!
10538: Chelvadurai, we were just talking about you. The adventurer we hired has returned. Now, about Sanctia...
10539: She's become an adventurer! And this package is for me...?
10540: There's a letter inside. Sanctia says that she'll send more money from her adventures so that I can pay back my loans and go back to my wife...
10541: She's a good kid. Time for you to pull up your bootstraps and follow her example.
10542: I intend to do just that, Mister Zoriboh.
10543: Thanks for all your help, <Player>. It's not much, but here's a little something from me.
10544: If you run into little Sanctia again on your travels, make sure she's keeping out of mischief.
10545: I'll never let her down again. If Sanctia grows weary of her new life, you tell her she always has a place here with me.
10546: Sanctia's still young and full of fire. I'm sure she'll make a fine adventurer.
10547: I heard the news from Chelvadurai. Who'd have thought that girl would get her head out of the clouds long enough to do something constructive?
10548: Well, as long as I get my money back, I'm not really concerned either way. I've heard adventurers can make a fortune these days...
10549: And once Sanctia becomes a famous hero, she can help me advertise my business. Heh-heh-heh!
10550: Hmmm... So, you have heard the $3.
10551: There is more to the rumor than you know. The branch and the thread that those monstrosities have swallowed are the base materials for a legendary fishing rod.
10552: Should you manage to obtain those materials, bring them here to me. I am the only one left alive who can craft the rod of legend.
10553: Incredible... This is a feat worthy of the greatest anglers in history.
10554: Leave these in my care. Come to me again when the sun has passed through her cycle and you will be the first to witness an unbreakable spirit.
10555: Please, do not rush me. The crafting of a legend is not the work of mere moments.
10556: It is complete. I must thank you for this chance to create such a masterpiece.
10557: This fishing rod will never break or splinter...
10558: You will be the one to prove that there is a spirit in this world that cannot be broken.
10559: Come one, come all, kupo!
10560: Greetings, friend! I am a synergy engineer, dispatched from the Institute to maintain the furnaces you see beside me. I also have knowledge and services to share with fellow synergists, if that is what you desire.
10561: I see from the puzzled expression on your face that you are unfamiliar with our discipline. To use these furnaces, you will first need to obtain $6.
10562: Piqued your curiosity, have I? Then you should speak with Hildolf, our institute director, at his laboratory in the Bastok Metalworks. He's always eager to welcome a new synergist to our ranks.
10563: May I be of service? [Not now./Learn recipes./Check fewell./Replenish fewell./Purchase materials./Receive training./Trade cinder./Get information.]
10564: Recipes, you say? Let's see what we have that's suitable for your level of expertise...
10565: ...I'm sorry. I'm afraid there's nothing I can teach you at the moment.
10566: I've got it! How about $0? Mind you, it'll require a certain level of skill...

10585: There you go. That doesn't sound so hard, now, does it?
10586: But of course! If you'll just allow me to inspect your $3 for a moment...
10587: Your fewell supply would appear to be as follows: o o $1 o!$2 o"$3 o#$4 o$$5 o%$6 o&$7.
10588: Running low? We can fill you up for a nominal fee.
10589: Replenish fewell? [Yes./No.]
10590: Looking for a fewell fill-up, you say? Then you've come to the right place!
10591: ...Hm? Why, your tank is already full to bursting. Come back again if you need a refill.
10592: Now let's see here... According to my calculations, I can fill you up to capacity for $0 gil. How does that sound?
10593: Pay $0 gil? [Deal!/No thanks.]
10594: Understood. Take care to monitor your reserves closely, lest you run out of fewell in the midst of a crucial procedure.
10595: I'm afraid you haven't the requisite gil, friend. Perhaps another time.
10596: Excellent! Now we just pop open your $3 here, and...
10597: There you go. Filled to the brim with a fresh batch of fewell! Can you smell those fumes? Mmm-mmm!
10598: Your $3 has been filled to capacity!
10599: You hand the synergy engineer $0 gil.
10600: How do you expect me to do that when your $3 is sitting inside a furnace, friend? You'll have to come back after you've finished synergizing.
10601: Materials, you say? But of course! Have a look at our selection.
10602: Purchase something? [Not today./$1 $0 : $2 gil./$3 $0 : $4 gil./$5 $0 : $6 gil.]
10603: For $1 $0 , that comes to $2 gil.
10604: Ah, another dedicated synergist looking to refine [his/her] technique. Excellent! That motivation will serve you well.
10605: ...But I'm afraid you'll need [/ever so slightly more/a bit more/more/a good deal more/considerably more] experience before you're ready to benefit from my training.
10606: And yes, it would seem you're at just the right skill level to receive my training. So, what will it be? Which technique would you like to improve?
10607: Train in which technique? [Cancel./Fewell feeding. (Current Lv.: $0)/Furnace thwacking. (Current Lv.: $1)/Pressure handle. (Current Lv.: $2)/Safety lever. (Current Lv.: $3)/Furnace repair. (Current Lv.: $4)/Fewell recycling. (Current Lv.: $5)]
10608: You wish to improve your [/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique. Is this correct?
10609: It would seem your [/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique already exceeds my own. There is no more I can teach you.
10610: Train in this technique? [Yes./No.]
10611: Very well! Now listen up, watch closely, and try to follow along...
10612: ...See, you take this part here, and... Yes, yes...just like that...
10613: ...Now steady here, or you'll be picking exploded furnace shrapnel out of your face for a week! Phew, that was a close one...
10614: ...And by applying Corollary Five of Hildolf's Third Theory of Inverse Transfocal Equilibrium, we find that...
10615: <Clink, clank...clunk> ...Er, let's try that once more...
10616: ...Superb! A quick learner, I see. If only all my students were as attentive as you!
10617: Your [/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique increases to level $1!
10618: Research into the composition of the cinder produced as a side effect of synergy just might lead to the next breakthrough in our field. Provide us with samples for analysis, and we will gladly reward your contributions.
10619: Trade in your cinder? (Currently: $0 Pz) [Not now./$1: $2 Pz./$3: $4 Pz./$5: $6 Pz./$7: $8 Pz./$9: $10 Pz./$11: $12 Pz./$13: $14 Pz./$15 gil: $16 Pz.]
10620: This is what you want, correct?
10621: Make the exchange? [Yes./No.]
10622: It would appear that you lack the necessary quantity of cinder for that transaction.
10623: Excellent! And this is yours. May it serve you well!
10624: You transferred $0 Pz of cinder to the synergy engineer. $1 Pz [remains/remain] in your possession.
10625: Ask about what? [Nothing./Synergy furnaces./Synergy overview./Synergy procedure./Synergy recipes./Fewell replenishment./Materials for sale./Synergy techniques./Trading cinder.]
10626: The synergy furnaces you see around town are provided as a public service by the Bastokan Institute of Synergy Research, to ensure that no synergist is ever far away from the tools of their trade.
10627: The synergist must provide his or her own $3, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process. Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.
10628: Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.
10629: Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town. If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.
10630: You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis. It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.
10631: Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results. The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.
10632: This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call "fewell." To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!
10633: As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require. Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.
10634: With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing! Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.
10635: The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be. In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!
10636: But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.
10637: If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.
10638: Take heart, though, as any materials inside your $3 will remain intact. You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.
10639: Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.
10640: Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.
10641: Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions. Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!
10642: You may be asking yourself, "Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?"
10643: Here's the good news: you don't have to! For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.
10644: The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand. At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.
10645: Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of $0, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.
10646: Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that $0 may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.
10647: Mind you, $0 is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it. Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.
10648: Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped. May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!
10649: First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply. You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.
10650: You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe. Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.
10651: Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy. If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.
10652: You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically. Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.
10653: From here, it becomes a race against the clock! Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.
10654: Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task. First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.
10655: Next, you can begin to feed fewell into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration. Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.
10656: However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions. Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.
10657: If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you'll want to employ the safety lever and pressure handle to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.
10658: You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition. Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.
10659: The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues. You'll need to perform periodic furnace repair should the furnace near its breaking point.
10660: It is also possible to recycle strewn fewell during synergy. While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.
10661: This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute. As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.
10662: As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable. There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.
10663: For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger. Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!
10664: You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.
10665: In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well. To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.
10666: Now let us return to the synergy process itself. As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.
10667: If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance. The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.
10668: Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills! Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...
10669: What's an elemental surge, you ask? Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.
10670: The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?
10671: ...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell. There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.
10672: Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe. We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.
10673: Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients. There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.
10674: Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.
10675: The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own. The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.
10676: In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as $0 can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.
10677: # cannot be attached directly. First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of $0 can then be embedded.
10678: The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment. There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.
10679: If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.
10680: As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.
10681: You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures. It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.
10682: Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant. Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.
10683: My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale. The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!
10684: The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.
10685: Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach. Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.
10686: To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.
10687: When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.
10688: Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call revertant.
10689: Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state! Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.
10690: As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call "fewell." The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.
10691: Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.
10692: To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!
10693: For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.
10694: That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your $3! What could be easier?
10695: Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of $0? If so, you've come to the right place!
10696: We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as mordant for sale. With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.
10697: Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff. You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.
10698: Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant. As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.
10699: Ah, synergy techniques! Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.
10700: My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques. We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.
10701: Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge. For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.
10702: Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents. You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.
10703: Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer. These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.
10704: The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills. To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.
10705: Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.
10706: Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation. Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.
10707: We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.
10708: It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold! Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.
10709: Wondering if your $0 can be outfitted with evolith, are you? Well, you've come to the right place!
10710: A quick look at its composition should tell us all we need to know. Let's see here...
10711: Congratulations! Your $0 can indeed hold [an/another] evolith aperture. A $2-shaped aperture, to be exact...
10712: ...Suitable for evolith of the following size and elemental affinity: Maximum size: $1 / [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&].
10713: ...Suitable for evolith of the following sizes and elemental affinities: Maximum size: $1 / Affinity: [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&]. Maximum size: $3 / Affinity: [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&].
10714: ...Suitable for evolith of the following sizes and elemental affinities: Maximum size: $1 / Affinity: [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&]. Maximum size: $3 / Affinity: [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&]. Maximum size: $5 / Affinity: [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&].
10715: ...Suitable for evolith of the following sizes and elemental affinities: Maximum size: $1 / Affinity: [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&]. Maximum size: $3 / Affinity: [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&]. Maximum size: $5 / Affinity: [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&]. Maximum size: $7 / Affinity: [/oo /o!/o"/o#/o$/o%/o&].
10716: That is all. Should you wish to have any other pieces of equipment analyzed, you know where to find us.
10717: Hmm... I'm afraid your $0 cannot house any more apertures.
10718: ...Alas. It's a shame, but it appears your $0 cannot be etched.
10719: Hmm, what's this? It would seem that your $0 cannot be etched at this time.
10720: Do you love synergizing as much as I love synergizing!? 'Cause if you do, you're gonna loooooove the recipes I have for you!

10724: Oh, the $0? Why, that's one of my favorite recipes, too! What skills does it require? Let's see here...
10725: Well, look at this. All you need is a furnace and your own Goddess-given synergy skills to make that one! Ain't synergy grand?
10726: Wait! No, don't tell me. You strike me as a [man/woman] who's looking to learn a thing or two about synergy.
10727: Learn about synergy? [Not today./Teach me!/Just give me $6.]
10728: A life without intellectual curiosity is a life hardly worth living. Should your eyes one day open to this truth, you are free to return.
10729: I thought you'd never ask! Synergy is both an art and a science: an evolution--nay, a revolution--in synthesis.
10730: Using $6 in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.
10731: What we call $6 serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.
10732: Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists. The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.
10733: Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your $3 into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.
10734: Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.
10735: Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium. The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.
10736: You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.
10737: But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.
10738: A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.
10739: That's why smart synergists synergize in numbers. Too many culinarians might spoil the broth, but when it comes to synergy, it's the more the merrier!
10740: An aspiring synergist, I see! If you're looking for $6, you've certainly come to the right place.
10741: I can sell you a splendid entry-level model for $0 gil. A small price to pay to embark on a lifelong journey of scientific discovery, wouldn't you say?
10742: $0 gil, paid in full!
10743: As promised, here's your $3. And because I like your enthusiasm, I've even stocked it to the brim with fewell for you! How's that for a deal?
10744: The synergist must provide his or her own $3, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process. Synergy furnaces themselves may be used free of charge.
10745: Should you wish to learn more about the science of synergy, seek out one of the engineers stationed throughout the town.
10746: Welcome to the MHMU's porter service, kupo! Which of your burdensome belongings shall I take off your hands today?
10747: Do something, kupo? [Porter service?/Buy a storage slip./No, thank you.]
10748: Is your gobbiebag splitting at the seams? Mog Safe spilling over? Why, an accomplished adventurer like yourself surely has more stuff than you know what to do with.
10749: That's where I come in, kupo. I'll gladly hold onto your prized possessions, freeing you space to gather up even grander goodies.
10750: To make use of my services, first you'll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of $19 gil.
10751: Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.
10752: You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.
10753: Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.
10754: Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip. I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.
10755: Invisible to you, at least. It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.
10756: When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.
10757: I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw. Simple as that, kupo!
10758: What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred! Pretty generous of us for a change, no?
10759: Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo. So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!
10760: For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.
10761: Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect! It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.
10762: Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.
10763: If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts! No "I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again!" Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.
10764: Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.
10765: If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.
10766: And that's all there is to it. This humble moogle can hardly wait to serve you!
10767: Buy something? (p. $16/$17). [Previous page./$0./$1./$2./$3./$4./$5./$6./$7./$8./$9./$10./$11./$12./$13./$14./$15./Next page./Cancel.]

10769: Deal, kupo? (Current gil: $18). [Check storable items./Deal./No deal.]
10770: The $32 will allow you to store the following items:
10771: $33.
10772: $33.
10773: ...and that's all.

10776: Is that $3 I see, kupo?
10777: What will you do? [Retrieve an item./Confirm storable items./Nothing.]

10780: You retrieve $0 from the porter moogle's care.
10781: Kupo? I'm already taking care of that item for you.
10782: $0, yes? Very well! Your precious property is safe with me, kupo!
10783: $0 [variety/varieties] of item, is it? Very well! Your precious property is safe with me, kupo!
10784: Is that a Magian insignia I see on that $0? You'll have to abandon your trial before I can take it off your hands, kupo.
10785: That $0 appears to be augmented. I'm sorry, but I can't accept such specialized gear, kupo.
10786: Curious as to whether I can accept that item? Let me check my annals.
10787: Why, yes I can! % can be stored with $1.

10801: What will you do? [Nothing for now./Ask a bunch of questions./Participate in Voidwatch Ops./Request debriefing./Request $3./Check voidstone stock./Request reward issuance.]
10802: Don't ask those questions. I won't answer them. Ask someone who will.
10803: I don't waste your time. Don't waste mine. A Voidwatch Officer could answer your questions. Best ask one.
10804: You're done with Zepwell Island? Good. Now go to Elshimo. After that? Norg.
10805: You'll learn more there...if you're worthy. If not? You'll be discharged.
10806: Ha, of course. You traveled far. Why? To fight.
10807: Dispose of targets in three lands. Not one land. Not two. Three.
10808: Western Altepa Desert. Kuftal Tunnel. Quicksand Caves.
10809: Where first? Anywhere. Just go fight. You're useless here.
10810: You're no one to me. But I was ordered to say these words. Be careful. Don't die.

10821: $1 cruor is required for the $3.
10822: Proceed with exchange? (Cruor: $0) [Yes./No.]
10823: You clearly possess an insufficient amount of cruor for this exchange. I take great offense to this blatant insult of my intelligence.
10824: <Player> hands over $0 cruor in exchange for $1!
10825: <Player> hands over $0 cruor in exchange for the $3!
10826: Hm? It seems you already possess $6. There is no need for you to procure another.

10833: A tantalizing light shines forth from within the crystallized walls of this fragment ripped from a Voidwalker, as if appealing to its bearer's most ardent desires.
10834: A crazed light shines forth from within the crystallized walls of this fragment ripped from a Voidwalker, as if seeking to breach the bearer's last bastion of sanity.
10835: Some voiddust, is it? Wait but a moment... Here is your voidstone.
10836: Some voiddust, is it? Wait but a moment... Here is your voidstone.
10837: It seems you already possess as many voidstones as you can carry. Please return after depleting your supply of voiddust.
10838: How many do you need? (Cruor: $0) [None, thank you./One ($1 cruor)./Three ($2 cruor)./Six ($3 cruor)./Nine ($4 cruor)./Twelve ($5 cruor).]

10849: Greetings and well met. I am a Voidwatch scientist charged with researching the potential uses of atmacite.
10850: Those who possess $6 may come to me to have their hard-won atmacite infused. Stratum abyssite also falls within my domain, so present to me any whose properties you wish to have analyzed.
10851: Ah, I'm also authorized to teleport folk to operation sites. Quite versatile, aren't I?
10852: I beg of you, friend. Lend us your stout sword arm in the fight to protect Vana'diel from the Voidwalker threat.
10853: What will you do? [Nothing for now./Have stratum abyssite examined./Request teleportation./Analyze atmacite./Ask about atmacite./Ask about atmacite enrichment.]
10854: What will you do? [Nothing for now./Infused: $3 (lv.$1)/Infused: $3 (lv.$3)/Infused: $3 (lv.$5)/Purge atmacite./Infuse atmacite./Enrich atmacite.]
10855: Infuse which atmacite? (Cruor: $24) [None for now./3 (lv.$1)/$3 (lv.$3)/$3 (lv.$5)/$3 (lv.$7)/$3 (lv.$9)/$3 (lv.$11)/$3 (lv.$13)/$3 (lv.$15)/$3 (lv.$17)/$3 (lv.$19)/$3 (lv.$21)/$3 (lv.$23)/Previous page./Next page.]
10856: Infusing the $3 (lv.$1) requires $2 cruor.
10857: Infuse $3 (lv.$1)? [Yes./No.]
10858: You do not have enough cruor.
10859: [Infuse/Purge] which atmacite? [None for now./$3 (lv.$2)/$3 (lv.$4)/$3 (lv.$6)]
10860: Purge $3 (lv.$1)? [Yes./No.]
10861: <Player> expends $2 cruor and is now infused with $6 (lv.$1)!
10862: The atmacite could not be infused...
10863: <Player> has been purged of the $3 (lv.$1).
10864: <Player> purges the $3 (lv.$1), infusing $6 (lv.$3) in its place. (Cruor expended: $4)
10865: You do not possess any atmacite capable of enrichment.
10866: Enrich which atmacite? (Cruor: $$) [None for now./3 (lv.$1): $2/$3 (lv.$4): $5/$3 (lv.$7): $8/$3 (lv.$10): $11/$3 (lv.$13): $14/$3 (lv.$16): $17/$3 (lv.$19): $20/$3 (lv.$22): $23/$3 (lv.$25): $26/$3 (lv.$28): $29/$3 (lv.$31): $ /$3 (lv.$"): $#/Previous page./Next page.]
10867: Enriching the $3 will produce the following:
10868: Enriching the $3 from level $1 to level $2 requires $3 cruor.
10869: Enrich $3? [Yes./No.]
10870: Your $3 has been enriched to level $2! (Cruor expended: $0)
10871: The $3 has been enriched to its maximum level!
10872: The atmacite's enrichment level failed to rise...
10873: The atmacite could not be purged...
10874: The $3 (lv.$1) bestows the following bonuses:
10875: Replace $3 (Lv.$1)? [Yes./No.]
10876: Atmacite is best described as the crystalline agglomeration of a creature's soul. Our scientists have succeeded in discovering a way to tap its power to serve the efforts of the Voidwatch.
10877: By infusing one's body with atmacite, it is possible to obtain powers akin to those once possessed by the creature whence it came, rather like turning a beast's fangs upon its own kind.
10878: At first glance, atmacite appears to be the perfect artificial enhancement. However, it does suffer from a single limitation: its power is unleashed only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.
10879: Research to identify the exact reason for this continues, but most scientists find the spectral alignment theory compelling.
10880: That is, being formed of Voidwalker souls, atmacite will surge to life only when its bearer is existentially aligned to its dimension of origin.
10881: From this it can be inferred that Voidwalkers are stripped of considerable strength when they cross over into Vana'diel.
10882: But I suspect this is of little interest to a layman like you. Allow me to return to the subject at hand.
10883: The infusion of atmacite requires cruor, a potent energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.
10884: Cruor is obtainable by various means, felling a Voidwalker being the most common of all. As you can never have too much cruor, I urge you to be diligent in its procurement.
10885: We've recently perfected a method for improving atmacite potency. The process is called enrichment, and involves fusing cruor on to atmacite to amplify its power.
10886: Atmacite can be enriched in stages up to a maximum of level $0. The quantity of cruor required varies with the variety of atmacite as well as its current enrichment level.
10887: Under normal conditions, atmacite enrichment is an intensive process that demands trained hands. For reasons yet to be determined, however, both infusion and enrichment can be safely performed by laymen, provided they're at a planar rift.
10888: Keep this in mind should the need arise to reconfigure your atmacite with haste.
10889: Examine which stratum abyssite? [None right now./3./$3./$3./$3./$3./$3./$3.]
10890: Hmmm... I'm afraid the stone isn't exhibiting any signs of growth.
10891: The stone shows signs indicative of growth, but the changes are yet too slight for untrained eyes to discern.
10892: Oh my, such a magnificent display of evolution! Leaves absolutely nothing to be desired!
10893: Why yes, this stone is showing the initial signs of evolution. It appears there's still room for growth, however.
10894: Hmmm... I fear this stone's growth has been interrupted. Were you to find a catalyst of sorts, perhaps it could still evolve further?
10895: Hmmm... I'm afraid the stone isn't exhibiting any signs of growth. Perhaps a catalyst of sorts could help to spur along the process?
10896: How curious. I've not seen a stone like this before. Wherever did you find it?
10897: Your $3 has evolved into $6!
10898: Supply me with the $0 cruor necessary, and I shall gladly teleport you to an operation site of your choosing.

11635: You now have 5,000,000 cruor!
11636: We've just met, and parrrdon my audacity, but can I maybe call you <Player>?
11637: I don't know how I know, either! I'm burrrdened with this uncanny ability to sense everything about a person!
11638: How rrrude of me! I haven't even told you my name yet and I'm acting like I already know you! I'm Quwi Orihbhe, and I have trrraveled here from Adoulin.
11639: Don't look at me like that! I'm not a suspicious person! Well, I may seem suspicious, but I'm a rrregular Mithra! I'm so sorry! Ugh, why must I be cursed with prrrecognition!?
11640: I don't mean to be brrrash, but is that $6 you're carrying?
11641: Please don't think I'm trying to steal your thunder, but I've already sealed the geomagnetic forces of this rrregion into a single location! I'm so sorry!
11642: Do you want to...rrrecord this place for future use?
11643: Whaaat!? "No"!? But you will eventually! I've seen it in my drrreams!
11644: I knew you'd say yes! I just knew it! Wait...I remember this part! Next you're going to position your $3 over the grrround here.
11645: The prrrophecy has been fulfilled! I saw <Player> complete this procedure with my mind's eye not moments ago, and now it comes true before my verrry eyes!
11646: I oversee this waypoint, so come by any time! If only it didn't have to be me! You deserrrve better, <Player>!
11647: To tell the truth...I've been dispatched to this continent to investigate these concentrrrations of geomagnetic force.
11648: It's all just too much for a poor tyrrro like me! I can't take it anymore! I'm sorry!
11649: I was told to report to Master Anastase when I forrresee one of those points, but I forget the prrrotocol! I wasn't paying attention during our brrriefing!
11650: ...No! You can't be serious! Anastase wants me to rrreport in rrright away!?
11651: Woe is me...
11652: Aha, I can see it! A vision is coming to me! My stomach shall begin to rrrumble in mere moments.
11653: Therefore, how about you rrreport to Anastase in my stead? I have seen with my mind's eye that you're the rrreliable type.
11654: You have my eterrrnal gratitude. I will say with ninety perrrcent certainty that you'll embark upon a long and arrrduous journey. Just remember that sometimes it's nice to stop and smell the oasis.
11655: My mind's eye had shown me thirty seconds prrrior to your arrival that you would appear.
11656: Yay! How did you know I love $0? Can you rrread minds, too?
11657: My sincerrrest apologies, <Player>! I prrredict you're getting hungry watching me eat. Here, have this.
11658: Yes...everything is as forrreseen. Your arrival here was no accident.
11659: And I know what you are going to tell me--Anastase wants a rrreport. Tell him that I will contact him once I have better results.
11660: You brought some Adoulin cuisine for me? This was certainly unexpec--I mean, well within the rrrealm of the predictable.
11661: My whiskerrrs are just quivering with anticipation! Thank you very much!

11699: Record this fount? [Yes./No.]
11700: A palpable force wells up slowly from beneath the surface...
11701: This geomagnetic fount has already been recorded.
11702: You have successfully recorded the phenomenon. Now it is time to report your findings to Anastase.
11703: Your records surrounding the current geomagnetic phenomenon had been fading, but your use of the $3 has restored them to normal!
11704: Your $3 has been attuned to a geomagnetic fount[ in Selbina/ in Mhaura/ in Rabao/ in Norg]!
11705: Your $3 has been attuned to a geomagnetic fount[ in West Ronfaure/ in North Gustaberg/ in West Sarutabaruta/ in La Theine Plateau/ in the Konschtat Highlands/ in Tahrongi Canyon/ in Jugner Forest/ in the Pashhow Marshlands/ in the Meriphataud Mountains/ in Attohwa Chasm/ in Uleguerand Range]!

11710: My sincerrrest condolences, good [sir/lady].
11711: "Why?" Because I could tell thirrrty seconds ago that it was your destiny to come speak to me.
11712: My tail twitches can tell all. For example, that you have come to inquire about $6.
11713: How do you respond? [That's right./You couldn't be more wrong.]
11714: Wrong? Why, no, it is as I have foreseen--that your initial rrresponse would be to rebuff me!
11715: Of course it is. Then let's get down to the meat of the matterrr.
11716: Souls wandering eternally throughout the jungle...
11717: Hmm?
11718: Oh--oh dear. I've failed to explain how this all works, haven't I?
11719: Seeing the futurrre isn't as simple as closing your eyes and holding the $3 up to the light. No, I have to place an itty-bitty incantation on it.
11720: You may think this an ordinary doodad, but you couldn't be farther from the truth. The box is carved from frrresh Ulbukan wood.
11721: <Cough> And so! The latent energies in Ulbuka interact in various ways I cannot possibly explain, and purrrmit the bearer to catch glimpses of the past!
11722: Do you suppose it has to do with nutrrrients in the soil? <Shrug> Beats me.
11723: But, goodness! You didn't come all this way to hear me prrrattle on about the minutiae of Ulbukan flora.
11724: And so, without furrrther ado...
11725: O great Mother, whose compassionate embrrrace carries us upon the waves, return us to the land from whence we came...
11726: Grrraaaaaah! Enoyreve rof seikooc liart!
11727: Hey hey! Snap out of it!
11728: So, uh... When you come acrrross an area that might be connected to the events you seek, simply hold the box up to your forehead and think deep thoughts...though this may go against what I said earlier.
11729: If there exists in that location a prrroper catalyst for memories, then images and energies should come floating to you like smoke upon the wind.
11730: Should all go as I prrredict, you should be able to experience firsthand a brief snippet of the past...about thirty seconds, I'd guess.
11731: I'm feeling particularly magnanimous today, so the incantation is frrree of charge. Aren't you the lucky cub?
11732: Should you stumble across a location pertinent to your search, gently press the box against your forehead.
11733: With luck, you should find what you're looking for.
11734: Aha! You have come back to me...as expected, of courrrse! Please, share what you have learned.
11735: Wh-what? You saw something that took place centurrries ago?
11736: Such a feat is geomantically impossible!
11737: The farrrthest back I got was fifteen years ago...a vision of my mother relaxing on one of the archipelago's outlying islands.
11738: That alone knocked my socks off, but what you describe is a legendary experience beyond comparrre! Are you just pulling my tail?
11739: Ah, my friend of the unbreakable spirit. Tell me--how fares your fishing?
11740: You have not...lost the rod, have you?
11741: And you would do well not to in the future. It serves as proof that your prowess as an angler is beyond doubt.
11742: But as unbreakable as it may be...
11743: And no matter how your skill shines across the land... There is one whom I fear you cannot best.
11744: There is another--an exalted fisherman whose ability to reel in a catch is wholly beyond compare.
11745: One who can reel in the most savory of fish from their spawning grounds of Lake Mechieume and trawl in a hundred tuna from the Gugru Ocean in one fell swoop.
11746: Legends abound, and I am apt to believe they are more truth than fiction.
11747: Ah, do we have a visitor?
11748: <Gasp> Are you...are you...
11749: The exalted fisherman!?
11750: Mustn't give up fishing. It's very important.
11751: Giving up means failure.
11752: O, praise be unto Altana! Never had I thought to lay eyes on one whose prowess rumbles throughout the rivers and oscillates across the oceans!
11753: I like good fishers.
11754: This [man/woman] is good fisher.
11755: Time for a challenge?
11756: How do you respond? [It's on!/I'm not interested.]
11757: I'm not surprised. Many try, many fail. You fail too.
11758: It's a joke. You cannot win.
11759: I duly recognize the insolence of this sentence, exalted one, but any man or woman who could best you in such a trial would turn the course of history on its head!
11760: Yet this [man/woman] who stands to challenge you today bears an undeniable mark of skill--and unbreakable spirit, forged by the unworthy Irmilant.
11761: Dare I be so bold as to claim that we are in the presence of not one, but two exalted fishermen?
11762: This [man/woman]? Can catch big fish?
11763: I would wager three months' wages that the task is well within [his/her] grasp.
11764: Fine.
11765: You. You make legends. Go to many continents.
11766: My friend will judge. Deal?
11767: One whispered tale claims that the exalted fisherman plunged into fertile earth and dredged forth a bonefish three yalms in length!
11768: A true fisherman has the patience of a well-trained dog, the ferocity of a storied gladiator, and the willpower of a penitent ascetic.
11769: I would be honored to assist you in any way I am able. You need only consult with me for information surrounding legendary fish.
11770: I am yours to command as long as your spirit remains unbreakable.
11771: Ah, if it is legends you seek, then I have tales by the plenty.
11772: Which tale would you like to hear? [None of the above./The Dragon's Tabernacle./The Quicksilver Blade./The Matsya./The Phantom Serpent./The Lord of Ulbuka.]
11773: Even the most budding of fishermen has been weaned on tales of $0, a most similar specimen, so this legend I am about to tell you should come as no surprise.
11774: Deep within lightless ruins that stretch out beneath Elshimo Island reside these most fascinating denizens.
11775: The twinkling light in their eyes reminds us that divinity is found in all of the Goddess's creatures--and their name reflects that.
11776: Yet even such mystical legends pale in comparison to those suggesting their presence in Vollbow.
11777: Errant troubadours spin tales of remnants sunk far beneath the Zafmlug Sea, claiming that these briny creatures nibble away at the encroaching kelp to keep the marble halls pristine.
11778: Perhaps they are naught more than tall tales, but some threads of truth give me pause.
11779: Ah, many a traveler has been wooed by the tale of the quicksilver blade, a myth from Aht Urhgan on the Aradjiah continent that locals hold to be true.
11780: An otherwise nondescript weaver spouted a most unusual experience he had when traversing the Silver Sea toward Azouph Isle. His vessel became shrouded in fog, and he scarce could see more than several ilms in front of himself.
11781: A blade of the purest silver burst from the sea and came crashing down, threatening to cleave the vessel from stem to stern.
11782: The young lad fainted from fright, and when he opened his eyes found himself surrounded on all sides by curious Qiqirns.
11783: The more superstitious of the common folk went stark mad, claiming that it was long-forgotten spirits from the Kingdom of Ephramad come to exact vengeance on the living.
11784: Fie, I say. Blades do not emerge from the depths of the sea. Doubtless it was a fish or similar sea creature of a more aggressive nature.
11785: But for such a piscine specimen to be mistaken for a blade of pure metal...the mind simply boggles, does it not?
11786: Some years ago there existed a seascape called Vunkerl Inlet in the region known as Derfland.
11787: Though many oceanic species dwelled in waters both shallow and deep, one in particular was said to be the apple of every fisherman's eye, for it was as bright as pure sunlight.
11788: I myself traveled to Derfland on one occasion, hoping to reel one in and make my name known throughout the land.
11789: But the claws of war plunged their way into my back and I was forced to retreat, my pride wounded as much as my flesh.
11790: Were I to recite my failures as a fisherman, that would doubtlessly be the first.
11791: Have you heard tales of the four legendary fish?
11792: They are ancient beings which numbered four: $0, $1, $2, and $3.
11793: Yet there were curious reports of a legendary fisherman who hauled in a fifth whose name was not listed in even the most complete fishing treatise.
11794: He was said to have found the beast in Misareaux Coast, abutting the Zafmlug Sea.
11795: Imitators quickly flocked to the area and cast their lines, hoping that fortune would smile on them...only to return hunched over and empty-handed.
11796: The fisherman came to be the laughingstock of his guild, ridiculed and belittled for claiming to catch something that by all accounts did not exist.
11797: One eve he departed the guild, never to be heard from again.
11798: Yet I cannot help but think there are grains of truth in that sandy story.
11799: Which reminds me...the tale goes that he cut open the stomachs of the four dragons and used the innards as bait.
11800: That leaves the small matter of the location...but I am quite certain you can figure it out.
11801: Far to the west lies the continent of Ulbuka, a land said to be at the heart of geomantic leylines. This story has been passed down from the primal geomancer through her five disciples and to the present day.
11802: Serpents are said to guard the vast natural energies pulsating in a cavernous region of the continent.
11803: These keepers of the gates fervently believe that the serpents are intimately connected with the lifestream and are immortal as long as that bond is not severed.
11804: Those selfsame keepers claim that something lives in the waters within the caves' deepest recesses.
11805: What fascinates me most about this legend is the idea that non-sentient beings can be connected to the lifestream.
11806: I have the utmost faith that if anyone could fish up a legend beyond legends, it would be you.
11807: And thus with bated breath I sit, anxiously awaiting your return.
11808: I-is that the presence of a legendary fish that I sense?
11809: Does that mean you reeled one in!? Quick, trade it to me forthwith!
11810: D-did you really find $0? I had scarce dared to hope that the legends would be true...but you really found one!
11811: We found $1.
11812: Now eat and compare!
11813: He likes eating alone. Please don't look.
11814: First, the $1. ... [Aha./Mm hmm./Well, well./I wonder.../I see.]
11815: Yes! Very yummy!
11816: Hmmm?
11817: The birdie says that. Not me.
11818: Now yours. Gimme the $0.
11819: Oooh, this is... [Quite yummy!/Perfectly flavored!/Sweet yet savory!/Bold aftertaste!/Soft as silk!]
11820: I feel... [Happy pricklies!/Warm and comfy!/At peace!/Refreshed!/Invigorated!]
11821: Such yummy fish... I never knew.
11822: It's a new world!
11823: My life has meaning!
11824: Hmph. You win.
11825: But there's still time.
11826: Time to get serious.
11827: Running out of time...
11828: Next round is mine.
11829: That's it! I give up! Good [fisherman/fisherwoman] you are.
11830: My friend had fun.
11831: He has a gift. Gift for you.
11832: You mean to let [him/her] lay claim to your title?
11833: [He/She] wins. We have no choice.
11834: My friend likes fish. Brings back good ones. Very yummy.
11835: I show good spots. We have much fun.
11836: Time to go now. Must find more fish.
11837: Bye-bye!
11838: Ah, but you look confused. Allow me to explain--the exalted fisherman wasn't our Mithra of few words, but rather her apkallu.
11839: Even the most migratory of birds find it difficult to traverse all corners of the land.
11840: That's why he befriended her. She can take him to places ordinarily out of reach.
11841: Yet congratulations are in order nonetheless. I shall rue the day I ever doubted your capacity to lure in the most famous of catches.
11842: What is this? Your unbreakable spirit...quick, trade it to me!
11843: What is this? Your unbreakable spirit...quick, trade it to me!
11844: Sweet heavens above! It is...it is...
11845: Glowing!
11846: Your $0 begins to pulsate with a vibrant light!
11847: Despite all you have accomplished and the recognition that the exalted fisherman has given you, I know you will climb to greater heights--or is that dive to deeper depths?--and carve out an even greater legend.
11848: The path of a fisherman is unwavering and unceasing.
11849: ...As long as your spirit remains unbreakable and indomitable.
11850: Have you no shame? I stumbled across this $0 and could think of only one person to wield it...
11851: How do you respond? [I, uh...lost it./What's this, now?]
11852: Perhaps you are not as unbreakable as I once thought.
11853: I require one of the legendary fish...let's say $1. Only when you have returned with it will I bequeath the $0 to you once more.
11854: Should you desire your $0 to be returned, all you need do is procure $1 and trade it to me.
11855: Even the thickest fog can be pierced by the purest of light.
11856: Ah, the spirit is mended, and now all is right with the world.
11857: Here is your $0, as promised.
11858: It appears that you have arrived at a new survival guide provided by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network. Common sense dictates that you should now be able to teleport here from similar tomes throughout the world.
11859: Before you lies a survival guide penned by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network. It touches on such topics as teleportation and battle records.
11860: It appears that you have arrived at a new survival guide provided by the Servicemen's Mutual Aid Network. Common sense dictates that you should now be able to teleport here from similar tomes throughout the world.
11861: Before you lies a survival guide penned by the Servicemen's Mutual Aid Network. It touches on such topics as teleportation and battle records.
11862: What chapter will you read? [None./"Teleportation Assistance."/"Field Support."/"Other mysteries."]
11863: The meticulously illuminated text within explains that adventurers may travel to the location of any previous books visited after paying a sum of gil or the requisite amount of tabs.
11864: No other survival guide locations have been recorded. Visiting another one would certainly alleviate this issue.
11865: Where will you travel? [Nowhere./$8./$8./$8./$8./$8./$8./$8./$8./$8./$8./$8./$8./$8./$8./$8./$8./$8./$8./$8./$8./Previous page./Next page.]

11870: You do not have enough tabs.
11871: The records indicate you have fought valiantly for Vana'diel for $1 hour[/s].
11872: At the bottom of the page is a reminder. It perfunctorily states that you may receive $3 once you have logged a total of $2 hours.
11873: As per the custom noted within, you are eligible to receive $3 for the $2 hour[/s] of fighting you've accrued.
11874: Accept the reward? [Yes, please./No, thanks.]

11883: Remove which entry? [None of these./$8./$8./$8./$8./$8./$8./$8./$8./$8.]
11884: %0 obtains $0!
11885: That rod in your hand, standing so tall and proud--could it be...?
11886: Aha! A man's eyes may falter, but his sixth sense never lies!
11887: I would very much like to hear your frank opinion about such a masterpiece.
11888: How do you find the rod? [It's magnificent!/It's okay./It breaks all the time.]
11889: Ah, it must be nice to have a rod that works even after many, many years of use.
11890: You must have treated it quite gently for it to remain responsive to your every touch.
11891: Ah, I see. Well, after many years of continuous use it was bound to need a rest.
11892: One day you're fishing up $1 $0...
11893: And the next day you dip it into the waters only to come up dry.
11894: Ah, but that stands to reason, does it not?
11895: Everything with a form eventually breaks or goes limp.
11896: But that is neither here nor there. Have you ever thought about making your $0 more...virile?
11897: Fear not. I shall not ask you to scour the corners of the globe hunting and pecking for things which may or may not exist.
11898: A true fisherman remains steadfast and tenacious in the face of all odds.
11899: I'll show you my tenacity if you show me yours.
11900: How do you respond? [My tenacity measures up./I'm too shy./Let me think a little more.]
11901: Aye, now there's a [strapping young lad/bold young lass]! Let's cut to the chase...
11902: First, I'll need you to reel in a large variety of fish. Let's see...yes, $0 different species will work. I leave it to you to choose which rod to employ.
11903: Next comes the completion of particular Records of Eminence objectives that test your stamina. Complete all entries in the "Fishing (Tenacity)" category while equipped with your $0.
11904: Bring it back to my warm embrace once you have finished these two tasks and you shall have your just reward.
11905: A simple task for one of your...talents.
11906: Come back to me should you wish to have it measured. Your progress, that is.
11907: Until then, I bid you adieu and look forward to seeing what kinds of titillating specimens you have to bring back.
11908: Y-you have yet to complete the Records of Eminence objective $0? A dark day for mankind, indeed.
11909: A proactive fisherman such as yourself would stand to profit much from completing the variety of fishing-related objectives found within.
11910: Your first task, then, is to head to $8 and speak with [Rolandienne/Isakoth/Fhelm Jobeizat] to be instructed in the basics.
11911: Not the exhibitionist type, then? Well, to each [his/her] own.
11912: I'll be here if you're ever ready to compare.
11913: I can respect that. Take all the time that you need.
11914: I'll be here if you're ever ready to compare.
11915: Oho! I knew you wouldn't be able to resist!
11916: So let me inquire once more--are you prepared to show me your tenacity to draw forth the true power of your $0?
11917: Like an oasis cradled in the arms of the desert...like the blades of a windmill aching in the summer breeze...like the line of a fishing rod, taut and firm...
11918: Let us see how far I have gotten... Yes, I count $1 $0 .
11919: Oho! Here for me to judge your tenacity?
11920: Well, whip it out, then!
11921: Types of fish...fished ($0 or more): $1[./ (complete.)]
11922: Number of objectives completed: $1/$0[./ (complete.)]
11923: Total combined size and weight: $1/$0[./ (complete.)]
11924: Fished in designated regions: $1/$0[./ (complete.)]
11925: Bring your $0 to me once you have fulfilled all of the conditions.
11926: A-amazing! I can feel you pulsating with power!
11927: Your unbreakable spirit and relentless tenacity arouse inspiration the world over!
11928: Take hold of this $0 and be proud of all the work you have done!
11929: However... As vivacious as it may be now, it still remains an object that can be broken.
11930: I will, however, be able to repair it with oh-so-gentle a touch if you bring it to me together with $0.
11931: No matter how much you may throb and ache for something more, know that your unbreakable spirit is more than sufficient to achieve all you desire.
11932: I, too, shall return to the calming waters and see if I can reel in something magnificent.
11933: Polished by hours spent in a sweaty, passionate grip, a rod absorbs the sublime energies needed to unlock its full potential.
11934: And all that good-for-nothing son of mine can fish up are $0! Tenacity never was his forte...
11935: Remember my words: if something has form, it can be broken.
11936: Bring me your $0 together with $1 and I may be able to put the pieces back together.
11937: Oho! Come to have your rod buffed up? Let me just get my hands around it and...
11938: Ah, a perfect piece of work! It was a simple affair, what with all the tenacity charged up in this piece of work.
11939: Urk! Y-you lost your $0!?
11940: You might think it naught but a lifeless tool, but it contains a vital part of you inside!
11941: I have no choice but to make you another, for which I require $0. Be warned: it'll take me some time to erect such a magnificent, towering rod.
11942: Ah, just the material I need to refashion $0 for you.
11943: You must restrain yourself from getting overly excited--the process will take some time.
11944: Perfection can't be rushed, my eager friend! Come back once the sun has risen once more.
11945: Ah, a wonderful reconstruction, worthy of hands such as yours! But for the love of all that is holy--don't go losing it again!
11946: Well look who it is--and that $0 of yours!
11947: You've mastered the art of repairing such items via synthesis.
11948: Let me check whether it has the proper hardness and firmness.
11949: Well look who it is--and that $0 of yours!
11950: What pristine shape it's in! Are you using a moisturizer to keep the wood so supple?
11951: You would ask me to repair your $0?
11952: But wait--this is no ordinary rod! To think, something infused with such spirit, such verve. It positively radiates!
11953: Unfortunately, such a feat lies well beyond my own talents. The most appropriate person would be Jourdenaux, who lies just beyond.
11954: Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Rolandienne in Southern San d'Oria (G-10).

11961: A new Records of Eminence objective is now available!
11962: A new Records of Eminence objective, "$0," is now available!
11963: You wish to exchange your sparks?
11964: Wait but a moment. Here, follow this command--er, compendium to the letter and you should be able to learn a thing or two.
11965: Ah, this almost slipped my mind. Should you receive any distinct sorts of artifacts for completing an objective, I will be happy to take them off your hands.
11966: Worry not, for I am not out to rob you of your glory. Quite the opposite, in fact. I will provide you with a worthwhile reward for collecting them.
11967: Thanks to your donation, I now have $1 $0 in safekeeping.
11968: Ohohoho... Turning in sparks, I see.
11969: Hold your hoarder hares, [hero/heroine]. I love your enthusiasm, but you're not going to learn a thing without a primer. Ahhh, here it is. Have a look-see.
11970: Oh, crud, that's right. You should trade me any special artifacts you get from completing objectives.
11971: "Why?" What a good question! Because I'll give you a nifty-difty reward at some point, that's why.
11972: Thanks for doing what I asked. Now I have a total of $1 $0 from you.
11973: You want to trrrade in sparks, do you?
11974: Let me wake up from my catnap first... Alright, now rrread this.
11975: Wait, wait, wait! If you happen to get any purrrticularly interesting items from completing objectives, send them my way.
11976: Don't worry, I'm as honest as a cat when the meat's out of reach. I thought of taking them all for myself...
11977: ...but I don't want to make fur fly with the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network, so I'll do my job like a good little kitty.
11978: Grrreat! Now I have $1 $0 from you. Thanks!
11979: Hm? Oh, spark exchange... Of course.
11980: I'm not completely sure, but this might help set some things straight...I guess.
11981: Let me add one thing. Please find it within your heart of hearts to give me anything of particular interest you get from completing objectives.
11982: I'll make it worth your while...I swear! Just keep at it and I'll be sure to surprise you with a hot, steaming helping of gratitude one day.
11983: Thanks for doing your part in the battle for love and peace! With this latest addition, I'm now keeping track of $1 $0 for you.

12138: Can you see this simply scintillating stone, kupo? It's called a veridical conflux.
12139: Ask about veridical confluxes? [What are they?/I know what they are.]
12140: Veridical confluxes are not of this world--they are gates that connect you to "a secret place," kupo. I also know that there are many of them.
12141: But even erudite explorers usually can't see them.
12142: That makes things easier, kupo, because that means you must have met Kupofried!
12143: Have you met Kupofried? [Of course./Kupo-who?]
12144: Then you undoubtedly understand everything about veridical confluxes, and I don't need to explain them in detail, kupo.
12145: You...haven't, kupo? But you still know about the veridical confluxes? Well, I guess I'll take your word for it.
12146: (Positively perfect, kupo. The bait is laid out. Now to reel [him/her] in.)
12147: I bet you're completely curious now, kupo.
12148: How do you respond? [Sure am./Not really.]
12149: Just hear me out.
12150: When I investigated "the secret place" at the other end of this conflux, I ran into trouble, kupo.
12151: The malevolent monsters made me mad...and they're having an effect on this world, too.
12152: But they're super strong, and I've got no way of dealing with them myself, kupo. We moogles are lovers, not fighters.
12153: But we've got to do something or who knows what'll happen!
12154: So I want you to slay them, kupo.
12155: What will you do? [Sounds easy enough./Not my problem./Really, why should I care?]
12156: Are you[/ really] sure you want to let Vana'diel as we know it get obliterated?
12157: ([He/She]'s a stubborn one, kupo...)
12158: Many thanks, kupo!
12159: (Phew...I was almost put in quite the pickle, kupo.)
12160: You'll need $6 to go to "the secret place," kupo. Fortunately, I have one on hand.
12161: You'll need $6 to go to "the secret place," kupo.
12162: 5 are special devices made with mysterious moogle magic!
12163: They're extremely easy to employ, too. They activate automatically as soon as you enter via a veridical conflux, and information on any monsters you mash is transmitted to me immediately, kupo.
12164: And what's even better, they make sure you're not trapped in the netherworld as you find your way back! Just use it and you'll return in a flash.
12165: 5 can only remain active for $1 minutes (Earth time), kupo, and when the mysterious moogle magic runs out, you'll be bounced back to Vana'diel.
12166: The moogle magic will also expire when you use $6 to come back manually, and at least $1 hour[/s] must pass before I can power it up again.
12167: And only between 1 and $0 people may enter the verdical conflux at once, kupo.
12168: That's all from my side, kupo. Let me know if you have any other questions.
12169: Any questions, kupo?
12170: Inquire about what? [I want $6./Tell me more./Give me a status report./Learn about Sheol: Gaol.@/Mog Segment exchange list./Equipment for purchase.@/Augments./Nothing for now.]
12171: Here you are. Good luck, and happy fighting!
12172: You already have one. What do you need another for, kupo?
12173: It'll be another $1 hour[/s] before I can give you another one, kupo.
12174: It'll be another $1 minute[/s] before I can give you another one, kupo.
12175: Here's a summary of your efforts so far, including monster strength, treasure boxes opened, and the strength of your alter egos while inside, kupo.
12176: View which? [Sheol A./Sheol B./Sheol C./Moogle Mastery./Sheol: Gaol. /Back.]

12178: I thought you'd never ask, kupo.
12179: I've added new functionality to your $3.
12180: And it's called...
12181: ...Moogle Mastery, kupo!
12182: Moogle Mastery bestows your alter egos with a variety of special effects that are only active while you are inside "the secret place."
12183: Good luck in your adventures, kupo!

12187: 
12188: (Sigh...not another nonsense directive from above, kupo...)
12189: Oh, my! What tremendous timing!
12190: How do you respond? [Tremendous timing?/Something on your mind?]
12191: Just mumbling to myself, kupo! (...I've got to be a bit quieter...)
12192: Let's chitchat a tad, shall we?
12193: It's about the secret place, kupo. My moogle minions can't possibly go any further in! It's far too dangerous for us.
12194: And it falls to you, my faithful friend, to do what we cannot!
12195: ([He/She]'s back, kupo... But what's with the smile?)
12196: ...Talk about scary.
12197: How do you respond? [What's scary?/Everything okay?]
12198: Hmm? I didn't say anything. (And [his/her] hearing would make a canine jealous.)
12199: I bet you know what I'm going to ask you.
12200: It's time to go back to the secret place, and of course it falls to you and your expertise to make it happen!
12201: Go forth and do us moogles proud!
12202: Which item? ($0 segment[/s]) [$3: 3000./$2: 500./$3: 750./$4: 1000./$5: 1500./Back.]
12203: Moogle segments!
12204: You will sometime receive moogle segments while investigating inside Odyssey, kupo! These can be exchanged for a variety of items.
12205: You may purchase up to $10.
12206: Purchase $0 $0$0 ?
12207: Confirm your purchase. [Purchase./Do not purchase.]
12208: Purchase $0 $5, kupo?
12209: Your superlative strength spurs me on!
12210: But I'm still fully fearful of what happens when the darkness comes...
12211: Kupo!
12212: It's n-nothing, kupo!
12213: How do you respond? [Darkness?/...You okay?]
12214: N-never mind that! I'm just, uh...happy to see you safe and sound!
12215: Let's try this again, shall we?
12216: Now, focus. Focus!
12217: Ahem. I'd like to thank you for all the work you've done helping me with my investigations.
12218: Your effervescent efforts have enabled me to devise a way further inside.
12219: How do you respond? [Is that so?/(Quietly listen.)]
12220: I was in the middle of my sentence, kupo! Wait your turn before speaking!
12221: This place is completely unlike the others.
12222: And the danger is triple. No, quintuple! But I've found something special that may help you inside.
12223: First off, let me give you three $5. They'll help you once you're inside.
12224: 5 are designed to withstand the nefarious energies of...you-know-where.
12225: If your $3 breaks, you won't be able to come back. Hence the $3.
12226: The two devices are similar both in function and method of use. The exact point of timing is a little different, but I'm sure you'll figure it out.
12227: Unfortunately, its high durability is offset by its relatively lower operation time. It doesn't last long, in other words. And since its transmission rate is similarly short, your journey will require a little bit of finesse.
12228: But since I don't want to be stuck there, either, I've made extra sure that it should bring you back safely.
12229: Your $3 only lasts for $2 minutes (Earth time), at which point the failsafe activates and you will be unceremoniously dumped back to where I am.
12230: I'll be located somewhere safe close by, so you can always come back to me at any time. Once all three are used up, your journey will be at an end.
12231: I suppose one of the other good things about this device is that I don't need to perform any special tricks on it.
12232: 
12233: I can use segments to instantly ready your $3, but remember that you will need three to start.
12234: Only between 1 and $3 players can enter the veridical conflux at any given time.
12235: What will you do? [Head right in./Ask what the catch is.]
12236: Don't be so headstrong! I'm not done yet.
12237: I wouldn't call it a "catch," but there is something else, kupo.
12238: There have been some dampening effects reported of late. Plural, not singular.
12239: How do you respond? [Dampening effects?/Tell me more.]
12240: Hmm. How can I put it in layman's terms?
12241: You won't be able to use support jobs.
12242: And every party member must have a different main job.
12243: And once you've used a particular job for an individual foray, you won't be able to use that job again until you leave.
12244: The mathematically inclined will note that since you have three $5, each party member will have to prepare to use three times as many jobs as normal.
12245: Oh, and those alter egos you've grown so fond of? They will become sealed in the same way as your jobs, kupo. Once you've used one, they're out for the remainder of your time there.
12246: On the bright side, alter egos can be called forth in combat.
12247: That should be everything! Let me know if you have any questions.
12248: I think this may be the limits of how much I'm able to help you. Make sure you are fully ready for the trials within!
12249: Wow! Expertly done!
12250: I'm able to provide you with some spoils in recognition of your tremendous efforts.
12251: The more fiends you defeat, the greater the rewards I can give you...for a price, of course.
12252: Getting tired yet?
12253: How do you respond? [Tired? Me?/Not on your life.]
12254: Of course you aren't. What was I thinking? ([He/She] is definitely tired, kupo.)
12255: All the threats you've faced so far were of the comparatively tame variety. We're just getting started.
12256: I would, in fact, wager that they are matching you malm for malm.
12257: But that just means you have to step up your efforts, right?
12258: I'm now able to augment equipment that you have purchased.
12259: Equipment, of course, correponds to certain monsters you have vanquished.
12260: If you've vanquished the corresponding monster, the augments will get even better!
12261: And don't forget about the segments!
12262: Good news! My augmentation techniques have improved by leaps and bounds!
12263: The limit for $0 is now $1.
12264: Boss Status and RP Acquired: [Dealan-dhe: Veng.: $0; RP: $17./Sgili: Veng.: $1; RP: $18./U Bnai: Veng.: $2; RP: $19./Gogmagog: Veng.: $3; RP: $20./Aristaeus: Veng.: $4; RP: $21./Raskovniche: Veng.: $5; RP: $22./Marmorkrebs: Veng.: $6; RP: $23./Gigelorum: Veng.: $7; RP: $24./Procne: Veng.: $8; RP: $25./Henwen: Veng.: $9; RP: $26./Xevioso: Veng.: $10@RP: $27./Ngai: Veng.: $11@RP: $28./Kalunga: Veng.: $12@RP: $29./Ongo: Veng.: $13@RP: $30./Mboze: Veng.: $14@RP: $31./Arebati: Veng.: $15@RP: $ ./Bumba: Veng.: $16@RP: $!./Back.]
12265: Let me provide you with a list of my wares for you to glance at when you will.
12266: Displayed augment values are their maximums.
12267: Which would you like? [#./$1./$2./$3./$4./$5./$6./$7./Exchange RP for segments./Back.]
12268: Segments owned: $11.
12269: Turn $0 RP into segments?
12270: Augment the $0?
12271: Augment the $0 with $1 RP?
12272: Augment the item? [Yes./No.]
12273: The $0 has been augmented.
12274: You receive $0 segments.
12275: [Atonement 1./Atonement 2./Atonement 3./Atonement 4./Nothing for now.]
12276: I can provide you with services for cheaper if you continue your investigations into [/Dealan-dhe/Sgili/U Bnai/Gogmagog/Aristaeus/Raskovniche/Marmorkrebs/Gigelorum/Procne/Henwen/Xevioso/Ngai/Kalunga/Ongo/Mboze/Arebati/Bumba/], kupo.
12277: You can select which type of $0 you would like. You cannot change your mind later, kupo!
12278: Which type? [Type A./Type B./Type C./Type D./Back.]
12279: Here you can play the game Mandragora Mania.
12280: Do which? ($1 jingly) [Play (random opponent)./Play (select opponent)./Purchase prizes[ (unavail.)./ (reset avail.).]/Set start pattern: ([Random/A/B/C/D/E])./Set starting player: ([Random/You/Opponent])./Read an explanation./None of the above.]
12281: Play against whom? [Green Thumb Moogle./Monsieur Kupont./Susuroon./A lamb./Yeestog./Atelloune./Kuyin Hathdenna./Kupofried./Chacharoon./Sakura./Back.]
12282: That option is currently unavailable. You will be able to select it again in $5 day[/s] (Earth time).
12283: Purchase which? ($1 jingly). [Reset rewards ($& gil)./$2: $3 j. [/$26]/$5: $6 j. [/$26]/$8: $9 j. [/$26]/$11: $12 j. [/$26]/$14: $15 j. [/$26]/$17: $18 j. [/$26]/$20: $21 j. [/$26]/$23: $24 j. [/$26]/$26: $27 j. [/$26]/$29: $30 j. [/$26]/Back.]
12284: You may pay $& gil to reset all rewards, enabling you to purchase them again.
12285: Reset rewards? ($' gil). [Yes ($& gil)./No.]
12286: You do not have enough gil.
12287: All rewards have been reset.
12288: You have already purchased the $2.
12289: You need at least $3 jingly to purchase the $2.
12290: The reward exchange period has turned over and all rewards have been reset.
12291: You may reset all rewards from the appropriate dialogue box.
12292: Set starting pattern? [[/$26] Random (A-E)./[/$26] Pattern A./[/$26] Pattern B./[/$26] Pattern C./[/$26] Pattern D./[/$26] Pattern E./No thanks.]
12293: Starting pattern set to [Random/Pattern A/Pattern B/Pattern C/Pattern D/Pattern E].
12294: Set starting player? [[/$26] Random./[/$26] You./[/$26] Opponent./No thanks.]
12295: Starting player set to [Random/You/Opponent].
12296: Read the manual? [Sure./No thanks.]
12297: Mandragora Mania is a game in which you battle for jingly by moving your mandragora pieces to the goal.
12298: Your goal is the [red/blue/green] one on the right, while your opponent's is the [blue/green/red] one on the left.
12299: At the start of the game, three mandragoras each will be placed on the eight game areas, excluding the goal.
12300: There are five starting placements (A through E), and you are able to select which one you would like to employ. The default setting is "Random."
12301: This explanation uses pattern A, but the basic rules are the same regardless of the starting pattern.
12302: The three [red/blue/green] areas in front of you are yours,the three [blue/green/red] areas at the back are your opponent's,and the remaining two are neutral.
12303: You must choose one area--either yours or a neutral one--to proceed.
12304: The areas are numbered from one to five starting from the left, and any mandragoras in the area you select will move.
12305: Conversely, your opponent must select either a neutral area or an area that belongs to them.
12306: From the right, those areas are numbered 6, 4, 7, 2, and 8.
12307: For example, if you select Area 1,one mandragora will move to Area 2and one will move to Area 3,and one will move to Area 4.
12308: Note that the mandragoras will move from the back first--last in, first out.
12309: You will receive points known as "jingly" each time one of your mandragoras reaches the goal.
12310: You will enter your opponent's territory whenever you go past the goal.
12311: If one of your mandragoras happens to reach the opponent's goal, the goal will be pushed back and your mandragora will return to your own area. You don't have to worry about your mandragora earning any jingly for your opponent.
12312: The order in which players choose areas will be determined based on your turn settings. The default setting is random.
12313: This explanation has skipped past your opponent's turn for demonstration purposes, but in the actual game you and your opponent will take turns choosing areas.
12314: However, if the last mandragora to move reaches the goal, you will get to take an additional turn.
12315: Mandragoras are a very diverse species, and the amount of jingly you earn is determined by the species of mandragora that crosses into the goal.
12316: Adenium and citrullus: 3 jingly (first player)/4 jingly (second player).
12317: Korrigan and pachypodium: 2 jingly (first player)/3 jingly (second player).
12318: Standard mandragoras: 1 jingly (both players).
12319: The game is over when either you or your opponent no longer has any mandragoras that can move.

12347: What's that? You want to know aboutaru the fugitive from Windurst?
12348: Yeah, I saw him. He was the suspicious-looking Tarutaru holding the orb, yes? I saw him to the west of here--near the entrance to the Quicksand Caves in the Western Altepa Desert!
12349: Although, the Mithra adventurer I was with said she didn't see anyone... What's the meaning of it all?
12350: You want to know about a suspicious-looking Tarutaru carrying an orb? Sorry, I haven't seen anyone rrresembling that description.
12351: Why would I lie to some rrresearcher about seeing him or not? For all I know, there could be some kind of reward for turning him in.
12352: What's that? You're asking if I know a Galkan child named Raebrimm?
12353: Ah! You must be talking about that kid wandering in the desert!
12354: I thought it was strange--seeing a kid like that all by himself in such a dangerous place.
12355: According to him, the monsters were actively avoiding him though. Have you ever heard of such a thing?
12356: Anyways, wait right here! I'll go get him for you!
12357: <Player>!
12358: I'm sorry... Were Gumbah and the others worried about me?
12359: You see, I actually started remembering some things about my rebirth.
12360: At the foot of some mountain, I found an eggshell in the darkness and then started climbing the mountain, when I met someone along the way...
12361: I have a feeling they were telling me that I needed to give someone an important message!
12362: Unfortunately, that's all I can remember. That's why I couldn't stay there and just do nothing.
12363: Do you know of Revelation Rock in the Western Altepa Desert? It's a large rock that rises up to the heavens above.
12364: Long ago, the Galka who lived on this island used it for their spiritual training.
12365: As such, I think my journey of rebirth may have begun from there... That's why I decided to check it out.
12366: However, that wasn't the mountain I saw in my dream. I wonder where it could be...
12367: So I then decided to look around here for anything that the Galka who used to live here might've left behind.
12368: In doing so, the adventurers in Rabao told me that there's a statue of a Galka deep within the Quicksand Caves.
12369: So, would you mind going with me to investigate?
12370: Although I could probably make it on my own if I kept myself hidden, I'm a little scared...
12371: Accept Raebrimm's request? [Of course./Sorry, I'm busy.]
12372: Please... I've already come all this way.
12373: I don't want to return to Bastok empty-handed. Please reconsider...
12374: Thank you so much, <Player>!
12375: Naturally, I won't do anything to cause Gumbah and Cornelia any additional worry!
12376: I'll write them a letter, so please go on ahead. You just need to enter the Quicksand Caves via the northwest entrance to the Western Altepa Desert.
12377: Once you're inside, head to the southeast and you should come across a small room containing the statue...
12378: Although, there is a rather special door along the way, and they say only an adult Galka can open it. I guess it's rather heavy.
12379: So I think it'd be a good idea for you to bring as many of your adventuring pals as possible, <Player>.
12380: Other than that, I heard there is one other way to open the door. You need something called $6.
12381: The one who told me about it said it could be obtained in the Eastern Altepa Desert. Fortunately, I was able to borrow one from him.
12382: Afterwards, head to the southeast and you should come across a small room containing the statue.
12383: Of course, it is possible that I still won't remember anything even after seeing the statue.
12384: But I can't just sit around doing nothing either. That is why I need your help.
12385: It seems the child known as Raebrimm came here from Bastok. Will you be taking him back home?
12386: Huh!? Are you mad--heading to the Quicksand Caves!? That place is crawling with Antica!
12387: You're the adventurer that was looking for Raebrimm, right?
12388: He was just asking me if there were any Galka in Rabao who are nearing their journey of rebirth.
12389: As far as I know, there aren't any at the current moment.
12390: However, if someone really is looking to abduct such a Galka, I gathered some volunteers to help patrol the area.
12391: Oh, look! There's Raebrimm now.
12392: <Player>!
12393: I went on ahead to speak with the people in Rabao.
12394: Like Dancing Wolf said, there doesn't appear to be any Galka currently on their journey of rebirth here.
12395: However, that just might mean that they don't know of any or maybe they've already been abducted...
12396: Oh, that reminds me! I managed to remember a few more details regarding my rebirth!
12397: The mountain I climbed was a mountain in Valhalla, right?
12398: Once I knew that, I was finally able to remember! Someone on the mountain told me the following...
12399: "When the World Eater Egg is awakened, the Galka will be led to open the gate to the underworld..."
12400: The World Eater Egg... The gate to the underworld... We've learned a lot from the Destiny Destroyers.
12401: They mentioned that the Galka are special to Odin, the god of the underworld. So that must be why I was given that message...
12402: However, I'm not the Talekeeper, so I quickly forgot everything I was told.
12403: Besides, only the most elite Galka are capable of leading our people.
12404: That is why I must speak with the Talekeeper.
12405: Hey, [miss/mister]!
12406: Are you surprised to see me here!?
12407: ...I agreed to listen to what Gumbah had to say, but I never thought it would bring me here, of all places.
12408: Iron Eater told me everything. The beastmen are after this "World Eater Egg" and it's all just one big mess.
12409: And Raebrimm had the eggshell, so that's why the black-clad Goblin was after him, right?
12410: So what about Raebrimm? Did he learn anything new here?
12411: What!? That dangerous mage known as Uran-Mafran did what now!?
12412: I see... I guess Cornelia was right to be worried.
12413: Is that true? I find it hard to believe that we visit some land known as Valhalla after we die.
12414: Well, even if it is true, what does that actually mean?
12415: And who is this master that Uran-Mafran is trying to bring back from Valhalla?
12416: Actually, that's not important right now. We should be more concerned about him learning the secret of our rebirth and trying to force open the gate to Valhalla.
12417: He is trying to stain the process of our rebirth, no?
12418: If that was the extent of it, that'd be one thing. However, if he destroys the gate in the process, that might mean that we could never be reborn again!
12419: I'm not sure if this Uran-Mafran knows where to find the gate to the underworld, but we should probably prepare for the worst.
12420: As such, it is imperative that we get there first and defend it from his evil plan.
12421: You're right! We should send a report to Bastok and then ask the soldiers here for help!
12422: Hmm... We don't have time to wait for reinforcements. I think we'll need to ask this adventurer here to assist us.
12423: You have already come this far... Will you help the Galka in our time of need?
12424: Will you help the Galka? [You can count on me./Sorry, I can't.]
12425: You've come this far! You can't give up now!
12426: I knew we could count on you. However, I must ask that you refrain from telling anyone about this unless absolutely necessary.
12427: Especially about the process of our rebirth and the location of the gate to the underworld.
12428: Okay, so the gate to the underworld that we must defend is located to the east of Reasoning Rock in the Western Altepa Desert.
12429: It lies beyond a door that we Galka commonly refer to as the Altepa Gate.
12430: Normally, one must perform a series of steps in order to open the door.
12431: However, it opens automatically when a Galka who is near death stands before it.
12432: Hmm... It would be nice if Uran-Mafran was unable to find a Galka currently on his journey...
12433: Wait, has anybody seen Raebrimm?
12434: Where is Raebrimm? [I don't know./He's on patrol./He's gone!]
12435: Hmm... I better go look for him. Something doesn't feel right...
12436: He is? Still, I want to go and make sure he's safe.
12437: He's gone? You mean nobody knows where he is? I've got a bad feeling about this...
12438: Gumbah, you'd better report back to Bastok first. You can look for Raebrimm later.
12439: As for you, you should go on ahead. We need you to figure out how to open Altepa Gate.
12440: What's going to happen? The tone in Oggbi and Gumbah's voice makes it sound much more dangerous than I expected.
12441: My assignment here was supposed to be nice and easy... No, I must forget about that and focus on the task at hand!
12442: Don't worry. We've received word that messengers have been dispatched carrying the news that any Galka on a journey of rebirth is being targeted.
12443: However, we have no idea when they will arrive. So we have no choice but to rely on Oggbi for now.
12444: What!? Raebrimm was abducted by the mage Uran-Mafran!? When did that happen!?
12445: Well, I'm glad to hear that Raebrimm and everyone else are safe now, but this whole situation is making my head spin!
12446: This is quite the situation. I never imagined that the door to our rebirth could be closed...
12447: Oh! Please keep this information between us. I know you understand the reason why...
12448: This is most troubling news. I can't believe that the gateway to our rebirth is closed...
12449: It's the fault of that Tarutaru mage, Uran-Mafran. He's going to pay dearly for this!
12450: Ooh... To remember...and be remembered...
12451: Ask, and you shall retrieve!
12452: Only a top Galka leader can get other Galka to follow him.
12453: That is why I need to tell the Talekeeper the secret message...
12454: I would be quite interested to hear this m-m-message as well.
12455: Uran-Mafran!?
12456: Raebrimm, is that Uran-Mafran!?
12457: Yeah! Be careful! He's a real bad man!
12458: That hurts, you know. I am m-m-merely pursuing m-m-my own personal justice.
12459: Uran-Mafran, there are no Galka here who are on the journey of rebirth.
12460: Furthermore, a group of musketeers from Bastok is here to take you in. Surrender and come quietly.
12461: Is that so? Fine, I will surrender, but I want you to answer my question first.
12462: Wh-what!?
12463: The beastmen in the group known as the Destiny Destroyers told me.
12464: Raebrimm, I know that you were given a special mission when you climbed the mountain in Valhalla as part of your rebirth.
12465: You were given the World Eater Egg eggshell and entrusted with a message. I want to know what that message was.
12466: When the World Eater Egg is awakened,
12467: the Galka will be led to open the gate to the underworld...
12468: Now I get it! I always knew you were special!
12469: You were chosen by my illustrious m-m-master, the Maelstrom Mage, Garazu-Horeizu!
12470: What!?
12471: No!!!
12472: Ooh... Memory...complete...
12473: Wh-wh-what does this mean!?
12474: No... I already know what it means.
12475: The musketeers told me that Uran-Mafran is capable of wielding highly unusual magic.
12476: I just never thought that I would've already been put under his spell!
12477: And even more than that, I now know that Raebrimm was abducted from right under our noses.
12478: I am ashamed for going all this time without even noticing it.
12479: Fortunately, you were able to rescue Raebrimm from Uran-Mafran after that.
12480: It's a bit late for me to be thanking you, but please let me do so anyway. You have my eternal gratitude.
12481: Raebrimm was abducted from right under our noses...
12482: I am ashamed for going all this time without even noticing it.
12483: Ooh... To remember...and be remembered... Ask, and you shall retrieve!
12484: You want to know about a suspicious-looking Tarutaru carrying an orb? Sorry, I haven't seen anyone rrresembling that description.
12485: I had no rrreason to lie to the rrresearcher. I plan to prrroperly apologize for my actions later.
12486: I received word from the musketeers regarding Raebrimm's passing.
12487: He was entrusted with an important destiny that could not be borne by any other. His success means that his life had meaning.
12488: As a Galka, I shall silently pray for him.
12489: How have you been? I trust your adventure is progressing apace?
12490: Every time I meet those Galka about to undergo their journey of rebirth, as well as those who have already done so, I am reminded of your bravery.
12491: Naturally, I often think of Raebrimm as well.
12492: I received word from the musketeers regarding Raebrimm's passing.
12493: He was entrusted with an important destiny that could not be borne by any other. His success means that his life had meaning.
12494: As a Galka, I shall silently pray for him.
12495: Raebrimm...
12496: Where have I heard that name before...
12497: I feel as if...I am forgetting something important...
12498: Hm? You know who I am, adventurer?
12499: Do you know Uran-Mafran? [Yes, of course./No, sorry.]
12500: I figured as much! I guess my magic did not work against you?
12501: Whether we have met or not, perhaps I have caused you to forget?
12502: Hold on... I feel as if we have fought before...
12503: Ah, that's it! Now I remember!
12504: You and your little friends stood in my way before I could complete my mission!
12505: The gate to the underworld... The Galka... That demon...
12506: Wait... The power source... Where is my orb!?
12507: Where is Uran-Mafran's orb? [I have it./Sorry, I don't know.]
12508: You can't hide it from me! I know you have it!
12509: I'll be taking that orb back right now!
12510: The $3 was stolen from you!
12511: What? I-it's nearly empty!
12512: It had more than enough life magic to resurrect my master!
12513: What did you do!? What happened to its power!?
12514: Th-this can't be... My wise and powerful master, Garazu-Horeizu...
12515: You say he was devoured by Chaos!?
12516: I find that hard to believe. No, I refuse to believe it...
12517: I devoted my life to serving the family...
12518: ...
12519: If I can gather enough power, even more power than before...
12520: You find the $3 lying on the ground.
12521: What!? You saw the evil mage Uran-Mafran!?
12522: I must report this encounter at once. He shall pay for what he did to Raebrimm!
