## String References

- **12782**: Ah, one of the Knights of the Iron Ram.
- **12783**: The captain informed me that you would be along soon.
- **12784**: What can I assist you with? [What is the Allied Campaign?/What are campaign operations?/What are freelances?/Nothing.]
- **12785**: The Allied Campaign is the comprehensive name given to the various operations carried out by the Forces of Altana against the Beastman Confederate.
- **12786**: As a reward for the nation that contributes the most in regaining control of an area occupied by the beastmen, dominion is granted for a short period of time.
- **12787**: Arbitration of the campaign has been bestowed upon Jeuno, since the Duchy has renounced all claims to any lands seized by their army.
- **12788**: The leaders of Jeuno were first to recognize that it would be no small feat to convince the nations of Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria to put aside all past differences and join in arms against a common foe.
- **12789**: And that is why the Duchy felt it necessary to motivate the three armies by offering rewards for their performance on the battlefield.
- **12790**: In other words, by simply battling our archenemies, the Orcish Horde, San d'Oria can expand its influence across the region, increasing our crystal and resource supplies, and thus further strengthening the Kingdom.
- **12791**: As a provisionary member of the Knights of the Iron Ram, the bulk of your duties will entail participation in various campaign operations.
- **12792**: Campaign operations, also known as Campaign Ops, is the term used for the various small-scale missions authorized by the Allied War Council.
- **12793**: When an operation is successfully completed, the nation is granted a monetary sum, paid by the Repositorium--an international bank funded by the four nations of Mindartia and Quon, and located in Jeuno.
- **12794**: To put it bluntly, the harder you work, the more prosperous your regiment...and the Kingdom becomes.
- **12795**: As for you, participation in operations will earn you Allied Notes, which can be spent on various items and equipment. Also, the more successful you are in your duties, the more important the missions you are offered will become.
- **12796**: Once you are ready to join an operation, speak with Sir Rasdinice and he will assist you.
- **12797**: Good luck, <Player>. The future of the Kingdom rides on your bravery and honor.
- **12804**: Freelances is the collective term given to special units and individuals who have not pledged their allegiance to a single nation.
- **12805**: While not necessarily our enemies, these groups do not fall under control of the Allied Forces, preferring to choose their battles. Heroes for hire, you could say.
- **12806**: However, their prowess on the battlefield is not to be underestimated.
- **12807**: If you happen to come across one of these freelances in your journeys, consider it your duty as a Knight of the Iron Ram to at least attempt to recruit their services. Perhaps your true heart and iron will will lure them to our side.
- **12808**: Might you be seeking employment with the San d'Orian military? If that is the case, then speak with Sir Mainchelite.
- **12809**: Might you be seeking employment with the San d'Orian military? If that is the case, you must first speak with Lady Houilloumie and renounce all ties with your current nation of employment.
