## String References

- **7546**: As people walk these streets, most of them marvel at the Hume technology that was used in building the waterwheels and drawbridges of this city.
- **7547**: But we Galka were the ones who built the foundations of Bastok, making it possible for those Hume contraptions to exist. Alas, Humes forget so easily...
- **7659**: Do you see that old Hume over there who seems a little too young for his age? I've seen an adventurer bring him $7 once.
- **7660**: Rumor says that he grinds those $7 into a powder and swallows some every day.
- **7661**: A sad story indeed, if true. Imagine, eating the remains of the dead in hopes of keeping death itself at bay!
