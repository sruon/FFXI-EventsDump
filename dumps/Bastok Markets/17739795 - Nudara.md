## String References

- **7493**: Well met, adventurer. My name is Nudara. I was once master of this fine guild. I now occasionally drop in to give advice to the young adepts, though they rarely have the time to lend their ears to the musings of a grizzled, old goldsmith.
- **7494**: As you can see, these days, exotic metals such as platinum and orichalcum line the guild's shelves like weeds in a garden.
- **7495**: However, when I was still young, the distribution of most all metals, from bronze to silver, was regulated by the Republic. It was a struggle to find enough resources to forge a simple ring.
- **7496**: It was regulations such as those that impelled us to focus on our techniques. It gave young soldiers a reason to spend a whole month's wages on something special to leave their loved ones before marching off to the front.
- **7497**: I shall always treasure the thought that my skill brought a glimmer of happiness in an age so filled with sorrow.
