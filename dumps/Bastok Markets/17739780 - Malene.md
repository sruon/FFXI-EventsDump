## String References

- **7478**: Well, well. What do we have here? An adventurer, I'd say. Yes, you do have that eager look on your face.
- **7479**: Well, since you're here, you might as well do some work for me. A monster took my parcel from the courier who was carrying it.
- **7480**: The courier said that he was attacked near the lighthouse in South Gustaberg. The adventurer I sent before failed to catch it, and the beast won't come out anymore.
- **7481**: There must be a way to lure it out. I would have asked Dalzakk--he is very informed in such matters--but he's out of town, adventuring. <Sigh> What is it with you people and this "adventuring" business?
- **7482**: If you manage to bring it back to me, though, I'll give you a reward. I know that's what you people want.
- **7486**: Good, you got it. Here's your reward.
- **7488**: Hmm? What do you want from me? Get out! Out!
- **8227**: What's this? You say you're looking for an Alisa?
- **8228**: What are you talking about? Everybody knows that Alisa died in an accident six months ago.
- **8229**: Her husband, Zacc, is looking for her?
- **8230**: <Sigh> The poor soul... The accident was so sudden. Zacc probably still hasn't accepted that his wife is gone.
- **8231**: It's so terrible, what happened...
- **8232**: Alisa also left behind a daughter. I think her name was Enu. Losing a parent must be hard on a child so young...
- **8233**: It's a cruel world we live in where a young mother is taken from her daughter--but an old, useless woman like myself is left behind.
