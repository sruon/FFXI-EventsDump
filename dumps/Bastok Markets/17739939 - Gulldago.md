## String References

- **12498**: Greetings and well met! Defender of the Republic, Gulldago, at your most humble service.
- **12500**: My station is to help along those new to the life of an adventurer in Vana'diel. I specialize in the types of fundamental knowledge necessary for success in such endeavors, as well as related methods of pedagogy. With my aid, you can rest assured that your first steps down the adventurer's path will not go astray.
- **12501**: Should you still consider yourself a newcomer, I would highly recommend that you make full use of my services.
- **12502**: This is my permanent post, and I never leave it. Remember it well. Whenever you need a hand with anything, anything at all, don't hesitate to come calling.
- **12503**: So, are you interested in some entry-level duties to put you well on your way to greatness? Not to worry, I've got just the thing for you!
- **12505**: Go talk to the guard Rabid Wolf over yonder and have him cast "Signet" on you. Then come back and see me.
- **12507**: Well, it looks like you were able to get your Signet. Easy enough, yes?
- **12508**: As long as Signet is in effect, there is always a possibility that you will obtain crystals from any enemies that you defeat. There are also other more concrete benefits, such as increased defense and evasion.
- **12509**: Signet even helps you when not engaged in combat with an enemy. For example, it boosts the rate at which healing occurs while at rest. For all of these reasons and more, you should consider it essential to have Signet cast on you at all times.
- **12510**: Very well, then! As a reward for successful completion of your first assignment I would like to present you with these $0.
- **12511**: There is more here than "meats" the eye! That was a joke... Anyway, this is a type of item known amongst adventurers as a "meal." This meal in particular will temporarily enhance your attack power when eaten.
- **12512**: Whenever any type of meal is consumed, you will receive some such temporary status bonus. Naturally, different meals grant different types of bonuses.
- **12513**: For the most part, meat dishes will affect attack power. Conversely, seafood dishes generally enhance defense, and so on and so forth. Take care to select dishes best suited to your purpose.
- **12514**: One thing you should make note of, however, is that you cannot eat a meal while another meal's status bonus is still in effect. Your stomach would simply burst!
- **12515**: Hmmm, that's quite a lot to cover... Are you with me so far?
- **12516**: So far so good? [Explain Signet again./Explain meals again./This is a breeze.]
- **12517**: Great! Well, talking can only prepare you so much. Let's get right down to it. Go ahead and pop one of those $0!
- **12518**: After eating a meal, a status icon designated as "Food" will appear in the upper-left portion of your screen. Come back and talk to me again once you've confirmed that it's there.
- **12519**: Check out the full belly on you! Well done! Signet and meals can both play crucial roles whenever you take on any type of enemy. This is a key lesson that you would do well not to forget!
- **12520**: Next, let's get those pristine hands of yours nice and dirty! No sense in letting that food go to waste now, is there? Let's send you out to fight a monster on a full stomach!
- **12521**: Exiting through that gate over there will lead you into an area with hostile enemies.
- **12522**: Try to target one of the monsters and then select the "Check" option from your menu. This will help you ascertain an enemy's level of difficulty and make sure they are not too strong. A smart adventurer picks [his/her] fights.
- **12523**: Be warned. Engaging any enemy that checks as "very tough" or above will result in your Signet not granting you the defense and evasion bonuses you would otherwise receive.
- **12524**: And that brings us to your next assignment!
- **12525**: It's high time you learned how to use a "weapon skill"!
- **12526**: Perhaps you've already noticed, but sometimes while fighting an enemy, your "skills" will rise little by little.
- **12527**: When your skill with the weapon you are wielding reaches a predetermined value, weapon skills will become available for use.
- **12528**: "Combo" for those adept with hand-to-hand weapons. "Wasp Sting" for those who fight with daggers. "Fast Blade" for those who prefer the sword.
- **12529**: "Shining Strike" for wielders of the club. "Heavy Swing" for those who take up the staff. And on, and on, and on...
- **12530**: Selecting "Status" from the main menu will bring up the "Combat Skl." option. This will display all of the current skill values in all weapon categories.
- **12531**: The first weapon skill for each weapon type can be learned at a skill value of 5. So make that your first goal, and we'll take it from there!
- **12532**: Ohhh! Somebody went and learned a new weapon skill, didn't [he/she]? Very good!
- **12533**: I can see by that twinkle in your eyes that you've already used it on some poor, unfortunate creature, but I'll explain just a bit more. Whenever your "Tactical Points" (TP) reach 1000 or more, selecting "Abilities" and then "Weapon Skl." from the menu will display a list of usable weapon skills.
- **12534**: These are deadly techniques capable of rendering massive damage on enemies. It is well worth an adventurer's time to learn and master them.
- **12535**: Ah, by the way, were you fortunate enough to receive some items from the monsters you fought?
- **12536**: If you were lucky enough to come across any $0, make sure you hang onto them. They may pay dividends later on...
- **12537**: Also, that reminds me. There is another lesson better learned sooner than later. The items you will no doubt come across known as "crystals," such as $1 and $2, are extremely significant.
- **12538**: They are truly versatile items that can be used for a number of purposes. These include trading them to guards for certain rewards, and selling them to earn money, just to name a few.
- **12539**: For now, I'd like to explain more about another of their uses. Namely, the role they play in "synthesis."
- **12540**: But first things first. Your reward for completing your last assignment! Here you are, then. $1, $2, and last but not least, $3.
- **12541**: Now, using $3 will bring up the synthesis interface. Once there, select the $1 and $2 as the ingredients to be added.
- **12542**: All that remains is to select the "OK" option, and the synthesis will commence!
- **12543**: You'll find that the crafting process will never begin, should the ingredients you've selected not form a viable synthesis recipe. Also, even when your materials are correct, there is always a chance that your synthesis will fail, so please be wary.
- **12544**: The majority of items which you create via synthesis, as well as most of those dropped by enemies you defeat, can be placed on the "Auction House" for sale.
- **12545**: The auction house is an ultra-consumer venue where you can attempt to purchase the wares of other players by placing bids, as well as have other players bid on items you have put up for sale.
- **12546**: My words alone can do no justice to the vast cornucopia of goods that is the auction house. One simply must see it with one's own eyes.
- **12547**: Are you still with me? [Explain synthesis again./Explain the auction house again./Sure am.]
- **12548**: Somewhere in this great city lies our nation's auction house. Seek it out, and report back to me when you have found it.
- **12549**: You needn't worry about going through with an actual purchase. Simply examining any of the "Auction Counters" will more than suffice.
- **12550**: So, you were able to locate the auction house! Pretty hard to miss, isn't it?
- **12551**: What do you think? It is as I said, yes? Few organizations in this world exceed the auction house in scale. It will never cease to be of use to you throughout your adventures. It would be wise to become adept at using it.
- **12552**: And now down to brass tacks! Let's see if we can't get you to up some levels!
- **12553**: There are several items in existence which serve to enhance the number of experience points you receive for defeating enemies.
- **12554**: For example, there are $0, $1, and $2, just to name a few.
- **12555**: These are a bit unique in that you must wait a certain amount of time after equipping them before you may use them.
- **12556**: There is also a predetermined amount of time, usually quite long, that must pass before these items can be used again. The total number of times you may use any single item is also limited, so be mindful of that as well.
- **12557**: Many of these items may be obtained from the same guards that provide you with Signet. You need only exchange "Conquest Points" in order to acquire them.
- **12558**: As a matter of fact, for finishing that last assignment, I'm going to give you this $3. With this, you'll be able to obtain $0 without having to use any of your Conquest Points.
- **12559**: Head over to any guard and have a go at exchanging them for something. And after that, see if you can't make it all the way up to level four. I'll be right here waiting for you when you get back.
- **12560**: With an experience bonus in place, it should take you practically no time at all. Good luck, and be careful! It can get quite hairy out there!
- **12561**: Well, well, well! We might make an adventurer out of you just yet! Looks like we've almost washed all that green off of you.
- **12562**: A bit of bad news now, though. Starting from level 31, anytime you are knocked unconscious your experience points will suffer a deduction.
- **12563**: As a general rule, the amount penalized will be about 10% of the total amount required to reach the next level. You have to be more careful than ever from here on out!
- **12564**: However, there are ways to minimize this loss of experience points.
- **12565**: Like this, for example. Go on, take it. Your reward for reaching level four. It's called $0.
- **12566**: Using this will grant you a status known as "Reraise." Whenever you are rendered unconscious while this effect is in place, you will have the option to revive yourself.
- **12567**: Choosing to do so will cause you to be resuscitated in the very spot where you have fallen. In addition, as I stated previously, the amount of experience points you lose will be somewhat lessened.
- **12568**: % and similar items work in the same manner as the $1 and the other experience bonus items I mentioned earlier. That is, once equipped, you must wait a certain period of time before they can be used, and there are both cooldown timers and limited charges as well.
- **12569**: All of these items as a whole are collectively referred to as "enchanted items." There is a vast array of other enchanted items with myriad other effects that will prove useful on your adventures. It may be worth the time and effort to better acquaint yourself with them at some point.
- **12570**: It seems you're starting to get the hang of things. Next, I'd like for you to go and fight some enemies in [La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon].
- **12571**: [La Theine Plateau/The Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon] is located beyond the [southern/northern/northern] reaches of [West Ronfaure/North Gustaberg/East Sarutabaruta].
- **12572**: You're sure to encounter some new monsters there that you won't find prowling around the outskirts of the city. It may be a bit daunting, so I'll only require that you slay one such beast, and then head on back.
- **12573**: Just keep in mind, the farther you stray from the city, the more ferocious monsters tend to be. Don't say I didn't warn you.
- **12574**: Make sure to use the "Check" command to determine the strength of your enemy. If you find that you are surrounded by enemies too difficult for you, try heading back to a previous area closer to the city and leveling up a bit more first.
- **12575**: I know those smells... You smell of victory! And of [La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon]! Good on you, <Player>.
- **12576**: But by now you must be getting sick and tired of fighting the same old monsters so close to the city walls, aren't you?
- **12577**: If you are several levels beyond a monster and totally outclass them in every respect, checking them will yield a "too weak to be worthwhile" result.
- **12578**: Killing monsters so far beneath you is borderline cowardice, and will net you no experience points.
- **12579**: If you start to notice more and more of these "too weak" monsters around you, consider moving farther from the city to a more difficult area.
- **12580**: Congratulations on another milestone! Reward tiiime! You've just earned yourself $0 experience points, hotshot.
- **12581**: Let's dive right into your next assignment while that blood is still pumping!
- **12582**: I'm going to up the stakes here a little bit, <Player>. But it's for your own good. I want you to go out and get all the way to level ten.
- **12583**: Considering your current level and the knowledge you have, you shouldn't confine yourself to the immediate vicinity of the city. You're more than capable of besting monsters in [La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon] at this point.
- **12584**: I knew you wouldn't disappoint me. So how's it feel? You're moving on up in the world. Time to put some money in those pockets. A $1-gil reward, just for you. Don't spend it all in one place.
- **12585**: By now you should be relatively familiar with the basics of battle. Am I right or am I right?
- **12586**: But don't go getting too cocky! This world is chock-full of monsters just waiting for the opportune moment to pounce and knock you out cold!
- **12587**: Depending on the type of monster, there are several factors that could cause them to attack you without provocation. I'll enumerate some of the more common types of this blatantly aggressive behavior for you.
- **12588**: For starters, and most obviously, there are monsters which detect by sight. They will attack you whenever you enter their field of vision. This is the most prevalent type. They simply cannot stand the sight of adventurers.
- **12589**: Next, there are those monsters which detect by sound. They can be a bit more dangerous than visually-dependent monsters, in that they will attack the source of any sound within a certain prescribed radius. You may not think it, but there are a great many monsters whose aural senses are far more developed than their sense of sight.
- **12590**: There are also monsters which detect their enemies' spellcasting. Much like the sound-detecting types, these monsters will attack the source of any magic casting within a certain radius of their being. Not surprisingly, many monsters in the arcana family rely heavily on this method of detection, which covers a comparatively larger range than the aforementioned sense of hearing.
- **12591**: And finally, there are opportunistic monsters which prey upon the weak and near-dead, pinpointing their prey by detecting low hit points. The family of undead creatures abound in monsters of this type. Even more distressing, the fewer the hit points you have, the farther the distance from which you can be detected.
- **12592**: Your next assignment will attempt to familiarize you with these detection methods, and train you to become adept at avoiding them.
- **12593**: I want you to travel once again to [La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon], and retrieve an item known as a "Gate Crystal."
- **12594**: Near the center of [La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon], you will find a large, white, almost otherworldly structure. On the area map, it is labeled as the [Crag of Holla/Crag of Dem/Crag of Mea].
- **12595**: There you will find one of an enormous series of crystals known as "Telepoints." Simply examine the telepoint you find there, and bring back your findings.
- **12596**: Only when you present your $3 to me shall your assignment be complete.
- **12597**: Exercise the utmost caution. There are many extremely dangerous monsters in the area you will be visiting. And take extra care not to draw the attention of any beastmen.
- **12598**: This shall be your final assignment. Go now, and may the Goddess watch over you.
- **12599**: Ahhh, the $3, just as I requested. Excellent work, <Player>.
- **12600**: And now for some information regarding this little beauty. As long as you have this $3, you will be able to be transported by the appropriate spell of teleportation directly to the telepoint from which you retrieved it.
- **12601**: I doubt that you will have many opportunities to use it for the time being, but you would do well to remember what I have said.
- **12602**: Several such telepoints exist, scattered throughout Vana'diel. Each has its own specific gate crystal, which you will receive the first time that you examine any of them.
- **12603**: Let me take this time to offer you a most heartfelt congratulations, <Player>! You have successfully completed all of the assignments I have laid before you.
- **12604**: And here I have a most fitting reward for you. A gift of $1 experience points, and $3 $2.
- **12605**: I fear that I have nothing more to teach you. From now on, your lessons will best be learned by giving a mindful ear to others and being ever observant on your travels.
- **12606**: Do remember, though, that the paths open before you will multiply greatly should you cooperate with other adventurers.
- **12607**: Leveling, for example, is an endeavor made immeasurably more efficient and enjoyable in the company of others. It helps to not only guarantee you some modicum of safety in numbers, but also rewards you with considerably more experience points than adventuring alone.
- **12608**: I suppose it does require a good deal of courage to approach an adventurer you do not know, but I strongly encourage you to do so. It may prove to be the beginning of an extremely rewarding and long-lasting friendship.
- **12609**: There may still be some small facets of adventuring that I can continue to offer you advice on. Should you ever have any questions or anxieties, please do not hesitate to come and see me again. I will do my best to be of service and set your heart at ease.
- **12610**: Go now, and go well. The world awaits its next great adventurer, <Player>.
- **12612**: Good day to you! Defender of the Republic, Gulldago, at your most humble service. Is there something in particular I can help you with this day?
- **12614**: What will you ask about? [Nothing just now./Search comments./Skillchains./Magic bursts./Skillchains and elements.]
- **12615**: Just as their name implies, search comments are original messages composed by adventurers which are readily visible to others when using the search function.
- **12616**: There are several different categories of search comments. These include, but are not limited to, "EXP Party," "Items," and "Missions and Quests."
- **12617**: Opening the "Search" function from the Main Menu and then selecting the "Comment" option will allow you to conduct a player search by comment type.
- **12618**: For example, if you would like to search for other players to form a leveling party, you need only select "EXP Party" from the list displayed.
- **12620**: Of course, search comment composition differs from person to person. You might want to conduct a search first to see what type of search comments are considered the norm before writing your own.
- **12621**: Skillchains are devastating elemental phenomena which manifest themselves when weapon skills are carried out in a precise and well-timed order.
- **12622**: The very natures of the skillchains themselves differ widely, being dependent upon the weapon skills used and the order of their execution.
- **12623**: To take a simple and timeless example, using the weapon skill "Red Lotus Blade" immediately after "Fast Blade" will yield a type of skillchain known as "Liquefaction."
- **12624**: Furthermore, adding a "Combo" after the liquefaction effect will produce a more advanced "Fusion" skillchain.
- **12625**: In the taxonomy of skillchains, each type is related to one or more specific elements. Liquefaction is bound to the element of fire, for example, and fusion to both fire and light.
- **12626**: Another crucial point, which I simply cannot emphasize enough, is the importance of timing in the execution of skillchains.
- **12627**: One must not be too overzealous, but too much patience can also be damning. It is most ideal to time the latter weapon skill to begin just a second or two after the preceding one is complete.
- **12628**: The possible weapon skill sequences and the different skillchains they yield are highly variegated. It is said of this time-tested battle art that it "takes a moment to learn, and a lifetime to master."
- **12629**: Magic bursts are another type of supernatural phenomena which occur after carefully selected and impeccably timed spells are cast following a skillchain. Such spells exceed their typical counterparts in that they are enhanced in both power and accuracy. You will commonly see magic bursts abbreviated as "MB."
- **12630**: Magic bursts will not take place if the element of the spell being cast does not match the element of the skillchain preceding it.
- **12631**: To take an example, a detonation skillchain, which has wind as its element, followed by an aero or other like spell, will generate a magic burst.
- **12632**: In the same vein, thunder, or any cognate spell, would result in a magic burst should it follow an impaction skillchain, itself deriving power from that very element.
- **12633**: As I said previously, some skillchains are associated with more than one element. Take fragmentation, for example. It is composed of equal parts wind and thunder. So chasing a fragmentation skillchain with any type of aero or thunder spell would create a magic burst.
- **12634**: The key to mastering magic bursts lies in learning the elemental attributes of both the skillchains you create as well as the magic you wield. The rest is simply a matter of timing.
- **12635**: For your convenience, I will go over the elemental attributes of all skillchain types. Pay close attention.
- **12636**: Level 1 Skillchain (Associated element): Transfixion (Light), Liquefaction (Fire), Detonation (Wind), Impaction (Thunder), Induration (Ice), Reverberation (Water), Scission (Earth), Compression (Darkness).
- **12637**: Level 2 Skillchain (Associated elements): Fusion (Light/Fire), Fragmentation (Wind/Thunder), Distortion (Ice/Water), Gravitation (Earth/Darkness).
- **12638**: Level 3 Skillchain (Associated elements): Light (Light/Fire/Wind/Thunder), Darkness (Ice/Water/Earth/Darkness).
