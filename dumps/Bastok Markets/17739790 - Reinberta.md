- **7161**: Renounce your rank at which guild? [None./Carpenters'./Blacksmiths'./Goldsmiths'./Weavers'./Tanners'./Boneworkers'./Alchemists'./Culinarians'.]
- **7162**: If you proceed, your rank in the [Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild will return to that of [craftsman/artisan/adept], and your skill value will revert to the maximum for that level. This procedure cannot be undone, so please consider your decision carefully.
- **7163**: Renounce your rank as a [Carpenter/Blacksmith/Goldsmith/Weaver/Tanner/Boneworker/Alchemist/Culinarian]? [No, retain./Yes, renounce.]
- **7165**: Ah, welcome, young [man/lady], to the Goldsmiths' Guild. This is a special association for those who work with silver, gold, gems, and all precious materials.
- **7166**: If you have no interest in joining our selected few, then off with you. There are no guided tours here.
- **7167**: Wonderful... You are one of those...what do they call them...adventurers, are you not? I think we shall start you off with crystal synthesis.
- **7168**: I'm sure you already know, but crystals are a form of condensed energy. Using crystal synthesis draws the energy from the crystals, and uses that energy to convert matter into different forms.
- **7169**: It sounds simple, but true works of art can only be made by forming an image of the item when you synthesize. The better the image, the better chances you have of getting a product worth keeping.
- **7170**: That's why professional goldsmiths such as myself can produce superior goods...but don't take it personally.
- **7171**: Our guild does not prefer crystal synthesis to traditional methods, but if you ask the others here, I'm sure they will give you some good advice. They are all top-class artisans.
- **7172**: The long history of goldsmithing tells the never-ending tale of man's pursuit for beauty. That history will continue as long as gold glitters. So, take your time, and start slowly.
- **7173**: Do you remember your first accessory? Do you remember the person who wore it? No matter how skilled a goldsmith you become, you must never forget how you felt at that moment.
- **7174**: It looks as if you are ready to take the next step in your goldsmithing career. Try your hand at $0.
- **7175**: Succeed, and I shall grace you with another gem of knowledge.
- **7176**: Ah, this is a fair example of craftsmanship. [Amateur/Recruit/Initiate/Novice/Apprentice] is the title you may wear. And remember...take your time. There is no need to rush things.
- **7177**: Ah, this is a fine example of craftsmanship.
- **7178**: Ah, this is an excellent example of craftsmanship.
- **7179**: This... This is a fabulous example of craftsmanship... No, a fabulous work of art! You have more than earned the title of adept. There is little more I can teach you.
- **7180**: This is so beautiful! I think I will be asking you to make all of my jewelry from now on!
- **7205**: Such ingenuity, such inventiveness! I commend you on your efforts and hereby grant you the title of craftsman. Continue to polish your skills and your bracelets and bijoux will shine even brighter!
- **7220**: Well, if it isn't our very own [veteran/expert/authority/luminary/master]. Quite some time has passed since you achieved your current rank. Are you perhaps ready to strive for greater heights?
- **7221**: Strive for greater heights? [Certainly!/Maybe later...]
- **7222**: Excellent! That's just the answer I was hoping to hear from our rising star. First, you'll want to speak to Ellard and obtain yourself $6.
- **7223**: Some guild points will be required for the transaction, but that should prove no obstacle for your considerable talents and devotion.
- **7224**: A shame that you would allow your potential to go to waste. But I will hold no grudges. Should you ever have a change of heart, simply say the word.
- **7225**: First, you'll want to speak to Ellard and obtain a copy of $6.
- **7226**: Ah, you've returned. And that look of confidence on your face tells me you've already grasped the contents of $6.
- **7227**: Very well, then. Your task is to craft $2. Now I'll only say this once, so I encourage you to take notes. The ingredients you will need are...
- **7228**: Finally, you'll want to remember to sign your masterwork. This is not merely a guild regulation, but also speaks to the pride that a goldsmith takes in [his/her] work.
- **7229**: <Sigh>... I thought I told you to take notes. I am loath to repeat myself, but will make an exception this once. The ingredients for $2 are...
- **7230**: Splendid! Marvelous! Spectacular! I am blinded with the brilliance of your craftsmanship. I hereby bestow upon you the rank of expert. Wear it with pride!
- **7231**: An admirable attempt, yet it lacks a certain...something. Ah, a signature! Do you so lack confidence in your work that you are unwilling to put your name to it?
- **7232**: Needless to say, this won't do at all. Back to the studio with you, and do try to follow instructions this time.
- **7233**: I see you have matured into a fine goldsmith. Perhaps it is time you entered the leagues of the greats. Try your hand at $0.
- **7234**: If you are able to complete this task, you will be worthy of the title of [artisan/adept/veteran].
- **7235**: However, you must realize that with the title of [artisan/adept/veteran] come certain responsibilities. More will be asked of you.
- **7236**: I do not mind you becoming [an artisan/an adept/a veteran] in another guild, but remember that your status among other goldsmiths may fall...
- **7237**: While I cannot prevent you from striving for [artisan/adept/veteran] status in another guild, bear in mind that you may find it difficult to maintain your high level of goldsmithing proficiency if you do.
- **7238**: <Player>. Is it true that you've been recognized as [an artisan/an adept/a veteran] at a guild other than our own?
- **7239**: I must say, I struggle to understand this decision. To put it bluntly, you do both yourself and those who would appreciate your work a disservice by not devoting your efforts to your one true calling.
- **7240**: Fortunately, it is not too late to reconsider. What would you say to giving up your [artisan/adept/veteran] status elsewhere?
- **7241**: It is a simple enough process--I can even inform other guildmasters of your decision to save you the trouble.
- **7242**: <Player>. I see that you are still spreading your talents thin. Do you not remember the conversation we had about focusing on your one true calling?
- **7243**: <Sigh>... But I have said enough. Dabble in lesser crafts as you see fit--it is of no concern to me!
- **14995**: Oh, hello again. What is that shield you're carrying?
- **14996**: I see... You must've met with her already.
- **14997**: Yes, I heard her story about a shield that can increase one's crafting ability. I must say, I'm a bit skeptical about the whole thing.
- **14998**: Although, if it's for real, it could change everything.
- **14999**: I know just how skilled you are, and if she selected you for this task, then I suppose you've got what it takes to make this shield.
- **15000**: Now then, let's get down to it. First, you're going to need the recipe, so try not to forget it.
- **15001**: First of all, you're going to need $1 to get started...
- **15002**: This particular item is used to get the Craftsmanship of the $0 up to its maximum value.
- **15003**: I have some notes here about Craftsmanship that you should hear. Allow me to read them to you.
- **15004**: You can increase Craftsmanship by crafting items that match up with your skill while you have the $0 equipped.
- **15005**: Craftsmanship will increase greatly when you fulfill certain conditions, but crafting the same item over and over again will reduce your gains, so try synthesizing something different if you run into trouble.
- **15006**: In its default state, the shield has the unfortunate tendency to lower the success rate of your crafting, but as its Craftsmanship rises, it mitigates that effect.
- **15007**: You can tell the Craftsmanship rating as well as the crafting success rate by looking at the shield. Good luck to you. Mwahaha...
- **15008**: That's all it says.
- **15009**: Come show me what you've got when the Craftsmanship is high enough and I'll make you the $1.
- **15010**: Your next step will be to obtain $2 and $3, which you can get from Puyutete.
- **15011**: You've made deliveries to people before, right? That's basically what you'll need to do here.
- **15012**: Simply talk to Puyutete if you need more information.
- **15013**: That's it for the ingredients. Once you've upgraded the shield, come show it to me. I'd like to see how it turned out.
- **15014**: What? You forgot the recipe? Okay, here are the ingredients again. Someone of your skill level really should remember these things.
- **15015**: You have a good eye for detail. If anybody can make this shield, I know you can.
- **15016**: Hmm... This really is something. I should be able to use this to make the $0 now.
- **15017**: So this is the $0...
- **15018**: This act of a craftsman pouring his very spirit into the shield to form a crystal... It could be used for all kinds of other applications, especially jewelry.
- **15019**: Oh, my. It seems that creating the $0 caused a reduction in the Craftsmanship of the $1.
- **15020**: That's not a problem to upgrade the $1, but if you need to make another $0, you'd have to increase the Craftsmanship again of course.
- **15021**: Although, I really doubt you'd ever lose such a valuable item and need to make another one.
- **15022**: Impossible. You're telling me you lost the $0?
- **15023**: I guess these things happen. Okay, let me see the shield. I'll make you another $0.
- **15024**: You're a top quality craftsman. You really should take better care of your ingredients.
- **15025**: I see you made the upgrade. Now, let me see what you've got there.
- **15026**: Hmm... The design has changed, and I can feel its power somewhat. Of course, it's nowhere near complete yet.
- **15027**: It's said that you can only bring out the shield's true potential by crafting with it multiple times.
- **15028**: Oh, that's right. I'm supposed to place some kind of mark on the shield once it's done. Give me just a moment.
- **15029**: That should do it.
- **15030**: Just show this shield to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno.
- **15031**: Oh, keep in mind that I'm constantly making deliveries to Puyutete. I hope you'll continue helping me out to educate the newer members of the guild.
- **15032**: Welcome. I suppose you're here to upgrade your shield.
- **15033**: Yes, she told me all about it. Here, let me get you the necessary recipe.
- **15034**: That's it.
- **15035**: Now, let's go over how to obtain the ingredients. First up is the $1.
- **15036**: Last time, you equipped the aspis while crafting in order to boost its Craftsmanship rating.
- **15037**: This time, you'll craft the items while equipping the $0 in order to increase its Craftsmanship.
- **15038**: Come bring it to me once it reaches 100% and I'll make the $1 for you.
- **15039**: Next up is the $2 and $3. I have given both of them to Puyutete, so you'll need to speak with her to get them.
- **15040**: The last ingredient is the $4. With the help of the A.M.A.N., I have prepared some Records of Eminence objectives for you.
- **15041**: Check the Records of Eminence menu for more details on the objectives. You'll receive the $4 once you've completed all of them.
- **15042**: That's it for the explanation about the ingredients. I look forward to seeing what this shield can become. Good luck to you.
- **15043**: Ahh, it looks like you've sufficiently raised the shield's Craftsmanship.
- **15044**: Now, wait just a moment while I prepare the $0 for you.
- **15045**: There we go. It really does have a nice shine to it, don't you think?
- **15046**: Oh, I thought this might happen. It seems creating the $0 causes the shield's Craftsmanship to drop.
- **15047**: If you lose this thing, you'll need to boost the shield's Craftsmanship all over again. Make sure you keep it in a safe place until you're ready to craft with it.
- **15048**: This is quite impressive. Even though it's not a piece of jewelry, it sure shines like one.
- **15049**: Yes, I can feel the immense power coming from this shield. I can't wait to see just how powerful it can become.
- **15050**: Here, let me mark the shield for when you show it to her.
- **15051**: That ought to do it. Show the shield to Mewk Chorosap when you get a chance.
- **15052**: Well, these things happen from time to time. I'll arrange for you to attempt the final objective one more time.
- **15053**: How are you doing? I suppose you're here to upgrade your shield? In that case, let me get you that recipe...
- **15054**: Huh? You already know the recipe? You just need to know about some of the ingredients?
- **15055**: Okay, for the remaining two ingredients, we have $4 and $5.
- **15056**: If you agree to help the guild deliver some orders, I'll be happy to give them to you.
- **15057**: Although, there's more to it than just making the delivery. You have to craft the items near the customer. They have a real eye for quality and want to see the work done in person.
- **15058**: There are some exceptions, such as items used for repairs, but most of them will need to be crafted in the presence of the customer.
- **15059**: You'll need to gather the materials needed to craft the items by yourself. You're free to use whatever method you like.
- **15060**: Oh yes. Did you know that we recently reached an agreement with the other guilds to sell some of their products?
- **15061**: They're not always cheap, but you can purchase them by speaking to each guild's crafting set vendor.
- **15062**: Of course, there's no guarantee that they'll sell you what you're looking for, so be sure to keep that in mind.
- **15063**: Once you've finished all of the deliveries, I'll give you the $4 and $5.
- **15064**: Okay, this is the [first/next/final] request.
- **15065**: Deliver $1 $0 to the merchant Honoi-Gomoi in $7.
- **15066**: Deliver $1 $0 to the merchant Honoi-Gomoi in $7.
- **15067**: Deliver $1 $0 to Naji the Mythril Musketeer in $7.
- **15068**: Deliver $1 $0 to Matoaka at the Gems by Kshama shop in $7.
- **15069**: You don't need to make this particular item near the customer.
- **15070**: Please report back to me once you've completed the request.
- **15071**: Let's see... The current task assigned to you is...
- **15072**: So, how is the delivery going?
- **15073**: Everything okay? [Everything's great!/It could be better...]
- **15074**: That's a relief. Please keep up the good work.
- **15075**: What's that? You want to abandon this task?
- **15076**: Will you see this through? [I'll do my best./I've had enough.]
- **15077**: That's unfortunate. Although, it's for the best if you can't give it your all. I guess I'll have to find another craftsman to help me with this customer.
- **15078**: Please try to get some rest. There'll be more work for you when you come back.
- **15079**: Ahh, it's good to see you're feeling better. I've already got another job lined up for you.
- **15080**: Ahh, it seems you have made the delivery to the customer.
- **15081**: That is the last of the deliveries. I'm really grateful for your help.
- **15082**: Okay, here are the $0 and $1 I promised you.
- **15083**: If, and I do mean if, you happen to lose one of them, you can always visit Puyutete and exchange guild points for another one.
- **15084**: Once this shield is finished, are you planning on making crystals instead? Haha... I'm just joking.
- **15085**: So this is what the shield looks like this time around, hm?
- **15086**: It's so bright... Your talent really is indisputable. I'm thinking our guild should start carrying your shields. They'd be one of our biggest sellers.
- **15087**: Our mutual friend has mentioned that the next upgrade should unlock the shield's true power. I'm excited to see just how powerful it can become.
- **15088**: Oh yes, that reminds me... I think you are skilled enough to use this new crafting technique I've developed. Please give it a try when you get a chance.
- **15089**: Welcome. It looks like we've reached the final step in this process. It's going to take every last bit of your knowledge.
- **15090**: You've heard which materials you need, right? If so, I'll explain how to get them.
- **15091**: First, the $2 and the $3...
- **15092**: You can trade crafter points for them. Go visit Puyutete when you have enough points.
- **15093**: Next, the procedure for the $1 is the same as it's always been. Just boost your shield's Craftsmanship to 100% and then come show it to me.
- **15094**: That concludes the explanation. Try building up the Craftsmanship first. Good luck to you.
- **15095**: You've probably already heard, but Mewk Chorosap wants this. Please deliver it to her for me.
- **15096**: Oh, hello. What can I do for you?
- **15097**: Ah, so that's why you're here. You're looking for the item that Tarutaru from Adoulin requested.
- **15098**: Unfortunately, I already sent it to Jeuno as per her request.
- **15099**: It should've arrived by now. You should check with Mewk Chorosap in Port Jeuno.
- **15100**: The strangest thing happened. That emblem you were looking for was just sitting on the counter here in the guild.
- **15101**: It doesn't seem as if it was returned. Oh, that's right. You need it for something, don't you. Here, consider it yours.
- **15102**: Oh! That must be it...
- **15103**: That's the finished shield. It truly is a work of art. I can feel it giving off a powerful aura.
- **15104**: Also, just you equipping this shield will be an excellent way to spread the word about our guild. This emblem will tell them all they need to know!
- **15105**: You have proven yourself to be quite talented. I think it's time I taught you this new technique.
- **15106**: Let us continue to create works of art that people will be proud to wear on their bodies.
