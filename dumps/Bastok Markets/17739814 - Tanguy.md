## String References

- **7531**: You wanna make money? Buy cheap, and sell high! That's my motto!
- **7532**: The merchants in the city are all crooks! Don't buy from them--they'll rob you blind! Buy items cheap from people who don't need them.
- **7533**: Then sell them to people who do--for more than what you bought them for, of course! "Check" people out to see what kind of items they're likely to be looking for. That's how you do business!
