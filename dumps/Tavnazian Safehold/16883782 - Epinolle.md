## String References

- **10773**: Would you take a look at those fuzzy guys over there? Can you believe that they'd come all the way from their cozy homes in Moogle-land to a town in the middle of nowhere? They must be really crazy or really bored.
- **10774**: Now that the airships from Jeuno have started arriving, there are a lot more people passing through the safehold. Those fuzzy guys over there seem pretty happy considering all the extra work.
- **10775**: You know about what happened to Cape Riverne, right?
- **10776**: Well, did you know that there's this traveling Goblin that's trying to make a new map of the area? Bet you didn't!
- **10777**: And I also bet you didn't know it was that Goblin who gave the areas their strange names--Site #A01 and Site #B01. Yeah, I just met the cute little girl a couple of days ago. She came to the safehold wanting to buy some supplies for her journey.
- **10778**: She said that she was almost done with the map, but still hadn't finished trekking through the most dangerous part of the area.
- **10779**: Now that I think of it, there's no way that sweet Gobmuffin can possibly make it on her own... Hey, you're a strong-looking adventurer. Would you go to Cape Riverne and see if you can find her and bring her back? It's a matter of life or death!
- **10780**: Would you go to Cape Riverne and see if you can find that sweet Gobmuffin and bring her back? It's a matter of life or death!
- **10801**: I wonder if my little buddy's okay...
- **10802**: Ah, what am I worried about. She's got more brains in her pinky than I do in my pocket! She'll make it back to her hometown. I'm sure of it!
