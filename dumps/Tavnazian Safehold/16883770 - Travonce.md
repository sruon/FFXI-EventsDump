## String References

- **10724**: <Sigh> I wonder if I'll ever have the chance to catch the "big one" before I cross that final river to Paradise...
- **10725**: [Laddie/Lassie], have you ever dreamed of reeling in the impossible? Hooking the beast that legends are made of?
- **10726**: Fish in your eyes? [All the time!/I'm a vegetarian.]
- **10727**: Vegetarian!? I don't have any business with you leaf-eaters! Move along!
- **10728**: Not but a few days ago, a young adventurer stopped by the safehold saying that she spotted an enormous "something" swimming in the waters of Lufaise Meadows. She mentioned that she tried to fish the beast up, but was unsuccessful. Just hearing that fish tale started my blood a-boiling.
- **10729**: I don't mean to blow my own horn, but when I was still a young 'un, there wasn't a soul in Tavnazia that didn't know the name Trawlin' Travonce. I was the finest fisherman on the whole peninsula.
- **10730**: And I still am, but my skills with the sword have dropped off a wee bit in these past few years.
- **10731**: With all the crazed beastmen roaming the islands and the savage monsters lurking below the waters, an old man can no longer just sit back and enjoy a day casting his line on the emerald waters of Tavnazia.
- **10732**: Now, if some nice strong young adventurer would come out with me and take care of all the pests while I fished, good ol' Trawlin' Travonce could snatch up the "big one" in the blink of an eye, give or take a few blinks.
- **10733**: Travonce looks at you with puppy-dog eyes.
- **10734**: <Sigh> Isn't there anyone out there...? Anyone at all...?
- **10735**: Will no one grant an old man his final wish before he withers away and dies...alone...and fishless?
- **10736**: Help him realize his dream? [How could you say no?/How could you say yes?]
- **10737**: You'll help me!? What a kind young child you are! I'll go gather my equipment. You know what they say, an unprepared fisherman is a...a...
- **10738**: Anyway, you'd better go make your preparations as well. When you're ready, I'll be waiting at the Porte d'Altendise. What, you don't know where that is? There are four exits in the northern end of the safehold, right? Porte d'Altendise is the southeastern one.
- **10739**: Oh, and I like to sleep in, so don't show up until after lunchtime. But don't come too late. We have to find that fish before he swims off somewhere to sleep.
- **10740**: Young adventurers these days... No respect for their elders. And to top that off, they're all nothing but a lot of spineless jellyfish, to boot!
- **10741**: And so the big one got away again... Maybe I am getting too old for this...
- **10742**: Ah, that's right. I guess I should give you something in return for helping me out. How about this fishing gear? It doesn't look like an old, washed-up geezer like me will be needing it any more...
- **10743**: At least I had the opportunity to go out under the crisp, clean Tavnazian sky one last time before I die... <Sigh>...
- **10744**: The other day, a fine young [man/lady] helped me go out in search of the "big one." Come to think of it, [he/she] looked an awful lot like you...
- **10745**: Why, you look like an energetic [lad/lass], all chock full o' pep. If I could only find myself someone like you to help an old man fulfill his final wish...
- **10746**: Don't tell me that you're having second thoughts. <Sigh> Maybe it's time I just went somewhere to crawl up and die...
- **10747**: Leave him to crawl up and die? [Why not?/Not just yet.]
