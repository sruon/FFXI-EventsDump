## String References

- **7847**: The marshlands beyond this garrison stretch for malms. The uneven terrain and ever-changing weather make it the perfect location for those slimy turtlebacks' headquarters. Take care when passing through, soldier.
- **7848**: I don't see your stripes. You're not a member of the allied forces, are you?
- **7849**: If it's work you're looking for, why not stop by the Republican stronghold in the Crawlers' Nest?
- **7850**: The legion has been using those caves as a weapons cache. I'm sure they could use an extra hand.
- **7851**: Oh, wait! Forget what I said. The nest was handed over to the Federation a number of weeks ago.
- **7852**: Though, if you're still interested in joining the Republic, you can travel to the Coveffe Barrows, but that's quite the journey.
- **7853**: Either way, I suggest that you find a nice, safe place to settle down...and quick. The wilds are no place for civilians these days.
