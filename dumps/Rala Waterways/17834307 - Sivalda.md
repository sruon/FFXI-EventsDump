## String References

- **8109**: Ever since my hubby lost his boat, the lovely Arciela has been so good to us.
- **8110**: She even helped the two of us find employment down here.
- **8111**: It's a far sight better than doing nothing! And in an odd way, I've come to think of these lovely little plants as my children.
- **8136**: The Civic Arboretum provides us with a stable food source, but finding provisions wasn't always so simple.
- **8137**: The Adoulin Islands are so tiny that space was at a premium. Only the smallest of orchards could prosper in any sort of way.
- **8138**: We imported all of our other comestibles. For example, Zulkheim flour has always been a hot commodity in these parts.
- **8139**: Of course, the arboretum isn't some agricultural panacea. We still have to rely mainly on trade with other countries for most victuals.
- **8140**: Hopefully this place will be the first step in self-sufficiency for our nation.
- **8671**: You scribbled down some information regarding $6.
