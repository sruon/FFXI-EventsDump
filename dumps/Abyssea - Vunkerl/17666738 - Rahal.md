## String References

- **8127**: I've not seen your face 'round these parts before, stranger. Another visitor from beyond the maw, perchance?
- **8128**: You there! I've a task for you, if you'd pray hear me out.
- **8129**: I am Rahal S Lebrart, Commander of the Royal Knights of San d'Oria. Or so I was, in the days when our proud kingdom still stood.
- **8130**: ...But I did not summon your attention to engage in nostalgic banter. No, a more immediate matter demands our attention.
- **8131**: To wit, I speak of a most savage pack of fiends that descends upon our convoys at will. Raze our precious supplies and feast upon my men, they do, before vanishing with nary a trace.
- **8132**: Rumor has it that from the twisted visage of one of these beasts sprouts a single jet-black whisker. A whisker that--ask me not how--affords him and his entire pack foreknowledge of even our most artful strategems. My men and I are nigh at wit's end.
- **8133**: But perhaps a fresh pair of eyes would succeed where we have failed. What say you, friend? Glean what knowledge you can of these creatures and that infernal whisker, and we would be much in your debt.
- **8136**: That...that whisker! Could it truly be...!?
- **8137**: Wherever...however did you find it?
- **8138**: Claimed it off a fiend, you say? Could it be...!?
- **8139**: We have them! Goddess's mercy, we finally have them! Prey on my men, would you!? Let us see how imposing you mangy lot are now, bereft of your almighty whisker! Ahaha! Ahahahaaa...ah.
- **8140**: Looking back upon it all, I must say I feel a mite sheepish. To think that I, the former commander of the Royal Knights, would be struck dumb by a mere bristle of feline facial hair.
- **8141**: What say we, ah, keep this matter between ourselves? In return, you may consider the whisker yours, and this as well for your troubles!
- **8142**: We move to put an end to the fiends' reign of terror once and for all! Yes...as soon as I've, ah, formulated a suitable plan of attack.
