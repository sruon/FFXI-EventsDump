## String References

- **8144**: Ho there, traveller! I am compiling data on the effects of the horde's incursion on the water sources here in the inlet. Have you ever taken a moment to reflect upon this vital environmental issue?
- **8145**: Considered the water? [Why, only all the time!/Er...not really./Have we met before?]
- **8146**: A [man/woman] after my own heart! For without water, there is no life. Is it not so?
- **8147**: However, I fear that the waters of this inlet, once so pure and pristine, grow more foul and stagnant by the hour.
- **8148**: You cannot be serious! So you have not observed that the once-pristine waters of this inlet grow more foul and stagnant by the hour?
- **8149**: Have we met before? In Bastok, you say? Why, no, I do not believe so.
- **8150**: But it matters not. We have a crisis on our hands here! Why, the once-pristine water of this inlet grows more foul and stagnant by the hour.
- **8151**: It would not be an overstatement to say that if the situation is left unchecked, we will soon lack for the very means to sustain ourselves.
- **8152**: Many a sleepless night and day--not that one can tell them apart in this bloody darkness--have I spent pondering this matter. And yet a workable solution evades me.
- **8153**: Why, just look! Even the verdant flora cries out for our aid, as it begins to wither and wilt before our very eyes!
- **8154**: Confound it! Whatever shall...we...
- **8155**: ...do...?
- **8156**: The flora...of course! How could I have been so blind?
- **8157**: I've got it! Great Kaiser's ghost, High Bear has got it!
- **8158**: ...Ahem. Forgive me. I am wont to get a bit...passionate...about my research.
- **8159**: If it would not be too much trouble, I would ask for your aid.
- **8160**: I need you to procure a few choice samples of the plants in this area. A thorough study of them will surely turn up the answers I seek.
- **8161**: How so, you say? Oh ho! Always good to see a [man/woman] with a healthy dose of scientific curiosity. Allow me to explain.
- **8162**: Like us, plants absorb water in great quantities. Unlike us, they are immobile by nature. Thus, the source from which they draw their sustenance remains constant.
- **8163**: By comparing plant samples collected from separate locations, I believe I can isolate certain key qualities of the contaminant that have heretofore eluded us.
- **8164**: There are three ponds here in the inlet: two just to the southwest of where we stand, and one a distance to the northwest. I would have you procure one sample of flora from the banks of each.
- **8165**: Let's see... On your map, that would be here, here, and...yes, right about here.
- **8166**: These are treacherous environs, and none too easy to traverse. But the survival of our people depends on my research. You must help me!
- **8167**: There are three ponds here in the inlet: two just to the southwest of where we stand, and one a distance to the northwest.
- **8168**: I would have you procure one sample of flora from the banks of each. With my analytical skills, surely that will be sufficient to get to the bottom of this mystery...
- **8171**: You've brought me the samples I requested. Wonderful!
- **8172**: Yes, I am sure these hold the answers I have long sought. I must begin my analysis immediately!
- **8173**: Oh, pardon me. I nearly neglected to reward you for your kind assistance. Take this as a small token of my thanks.
- **8174**: I have begun a detailed study of the plant samples you collected for me.
- **8175**: What results will it yield...? I can scarcely contain my anticipation!
- **8176**: Good to see you back, friend! I've been itching to share my research findings with someone, and this rock beside me leaves something to be desired as a conversation partner.
- **8177**: At any rate! I performed extensive tests on the sample you retrieved for me, and the results have proved...most curious.
- **8178**: Both the concentration and composition of the contaminants, you see, exhibited a wide range of variance even among samples taken from the same location.
- **8179**: At first, I could scarcely believe what I was seeing. Whatever could account for these drastic fluctuations?
- **8180**: That's when it struck me: a breakthrough discovery that is guaranteed to go down in history!
- **8181**: I had assumed that the contamination was being caused by a single, constant source--a clearly identifiable change in the ecosystem that occurred when the cataclysm struck and the hordes burst forth onto the land.
- **8182**: But these findings shed new light on the nature of our crisis! Whatever the source of the water pollution, it continues to adapt! To evolve! This demon that festers within the soil is a crafty one indeed! Ahaha! Aheaheaheahah!
- **8183**: Ah, I am sorry. Again, my passion for my science seems to have gotten the better of me. At any rate, one thing is clear: the situation calls for extended observation.
- **8184**: As much as I would like to conduct my own field work, I am afraid I have not the capacity to defend myself against the hordes. I would be ever so grateful if you could go in my stead.
- **8185**: Return to the three sites that you visited, and take note of any curious qualities in the plant life there. Report back to me with your findings, and I shall put them to use immediately in my work.
- **8186**: Take note of anything--anything at all--that seems amiss with the flora, and report back to me with your findings. Now hurry! I'm on the verge of another scientific breakthrough!
- **8196**: My loyal research assistant returns! Did you turn up anything of interest on your field excursion?
- **8197**: Anything to report? [Raindrops./Gunpowder./A curious ooze./Malodorous soil./Rotted fruit./Ash-coated leaves./Beastly footprints./Slimy leaves./Yellowish powder./Nothing of note.]
- **8198**: Raindrops! Did you say raindrops, my good [man/woman]!? Water...from the sky! Do you have any idea what this means!?
- **8199**: ...Er, well, neither do I. But sure as my name's Hieronymus T. Bear, you can bet your bottom cruor that I'm going to find out!
- **8200**: Gunpowder! Are you certain!? Can we be sure it is not, in fact, merely the excrement of that rare insect species known as the gunbeetle?
- **8201**: A curious liquid oozing from the plants, you say? How intriguing...
- **8202**: I wonder if it's as tasty as the fungus I found growing on one of my experimental specimens of pond fern the other day...?
- **8203**: Foul-smelling soil, you say? I'll have to ask you to elaborate a bit on that, friend.
- **8204**: Would you say it resembled the rancid, raw stench of behemoth breath? Or was it closer to the feculent, stomach-turning odor of peapuk droppings?
- **8205**: What's that? Decaying fruit?
- **8206**: And you didn't bring any back? Oh, how I would have loved to compare the flavor with my month-old, mold-cultured faerie apples!
- **8207**: Ash? Ash on the leaves, you say!? Why, this could only mean...er...ah...something mind-blowingly scientifically profound, I'm sure!
- **8208**: The footprints of a giant fiend!? Why, this calls for an immediate investigation!
- **8209**: ...By my assistant Raifa here. After all, it simply wouldn't do to risk our greatest surviving scientific mind--I speak of myself, of course--on such a reckless assignment!
- **8210**: Slime, you say? Intriguing! Reminds me of an old experiment of mine in which I left a slab of raw ruszor meat out in the open for three months. Discovered some new life-forms that time, I tell you!
- **8211**: Yellow powder, you say!?
- **8212**: Are you certain it was yellow? Not icterine, or perhaps chartreuse? These details might escape the attention of a layman like yourself, but I assure you that they are of vital importance!
- **8213**: But there must be something! Anything! If you won't do my research for me, then how will I restore aqua pura to this land and claim the scientific glory that I so richly deserve!?
- **8214**: ...Ahem. At any rate, I thank you for your assistance. You've given me some valuable information upon which to chew.
- **8215**: Yes...it appears the cause of our water crisis is more complex than even a scientist of my staggering talents could have fathomed.
- **8216**: But one thing is clear: there is yet much research to be done, and I must secure myself yet more suitably submissive assistants to do it!
- **8217**: For the time being, I shall apply my tremendous powers of analysis to the data that you have provided me. If you find yourself curious about the results, come back and see me.
- **8218**: Ah, there you are! You'll be pleased to know that as meager as your findings were, it was no obstacle to me in formulating a detailed program for restoring the water quality here in the inlet...a program that I have already taken it upon myself to put into effect.
- **8219**: Back to see the results of my cutting-edge water purification program, are you? Your timing couldn't be better!
- **8220**: I've just finished compiling the data, and...are you ready for this? The water quality in the area has [plummeted to new depths/demonstrated remarkable improvement]!
- **8221**: Unthinkable! As I could not possibly have been mistaken in my analysis, it is clear that the fault lies with you.
- **8222**: Needless to say, this is only the beginning. Still, the day that the name of High Bear is known far and wide as the savior of Vunkerl is no longer a distant dream!
- **8223**: You've proven yourself quite a capable assistant. I'm feeling generous today, so why don't you have this?
- **8224**: Ah, you again! Back to make yourself useful to the greatest living scientific mind in Abyssea, are we?
- **8225**: Do High Bear's busywork? [Why not?/I'd rather not.]
- **8226**: Many thanks! You know the drill by now. Return to the three observation points, and report back to me if you notice anything amiss.
- **8227**: The gall! Hmph. If you won't do my research for me, I'll just have to find someone else who will.
