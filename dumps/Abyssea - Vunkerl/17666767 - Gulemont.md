- **8453**: The help you've afforded the community has been of immeasurable value. You thoroughly deserve your reputation as the jewel of Vunkerl!
- **8454**: <Player>! I'd be hard pressed to find one among us who doesn't already know your name.
- **8455**: Your accomplishments have earned you the respect of all the folk here. I hope you will keep on doing good for the community.
- **8456**: Ah, <Player>. I hear your name quite often these days.
- **8457**: Most of survivor community has come to know you. This is undoubtedly a fruit of your labors. Keep up the good work!
- **8458**: Ah, <Player>. That is a name I'm familiar with.
- **8459**: The folk here are beginning to know you. In fact, your name pops up in their conversations from time to time. Don't let up your efforts, you hear?
- **8460**: <Player>? I might have heard the name somewhere before...
- **8461**: It seems to me you're not quite considered part of the community yet. But with some effort, you should be able to earn a place for yourself here.
