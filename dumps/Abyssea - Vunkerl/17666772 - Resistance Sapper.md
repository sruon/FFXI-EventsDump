- **7940**: Warning: Changing areas, logging out, or becoming disconnected will cause all data pertinent to this quest to be reset.
- **7946**: Greetings. I am charged with enlisting volunteers for resistance operations. Do you have a mind to do your part for mankind's struggle for survival?
- **7947**: Undertake which operation? [Ward Warden I./Ward Warden II./Desert Rain I./Desert Rain II./Crimson Carpet I./Crimson Carpet II./Nothing for now.]
- **7948**: The pulse martello and the clone wards are critical to the resistance effort, and must always be kept in prime condition. Your task involves transporting the materials necessary for their repair and maintenance from the stockpile to this location.
- **7949**: Being highly fragile, these materials must be conveyed within $6. This enchanted sack keeps its contents in pristine condition, but will inevitably tear if overfilled.
- **7950**: Should it rupture and spill its contents to the ground, the materials will no longer be fit for use. In which case, you will be required to start over from the beginning.
- **7951**: The more materials you can transport safely, the more highly you will be evaluated and rewarded.
- **7952**: Undertake this operation? [Yes./No.]
- **7953**: Very well. I shall issue you with this $3.
- **7954**: Hand me your map. I will mark the stockpile's location upon it. The integrity of our defense is reliant upon the repair materials. See that you do not dally.
- **7955**: What is it? Don't tell me you mean to abandon your mission.
- **7956**: Call it quits? [Yes./No.]
- **7957**: You do the Resistance a great disservice. I will just have to consider it fortunate that $6 wasn't put to waste.
- **7958**: Still determined to complete your task? Well then, carry on, soldier!
- **7959**: Hmph. Somehow I had foreseen this outcome. Your overzealousness has cost us a perfectly good sack.
- **7960**: Ah, you've returned. Without any ado, I will take the $3 off your hands.
- **7961**: Why, it's literally bursting with repair materials! Marvelous! You ought to be thoroughly commended, soldier. It appears you've made an art form out of transporting with $5.
- **7962**: I see you've managed to cram in a goodly amount of repair materials. Well done.
- **7963**: Hmm... Not a bad effort, but my eyes tell me there's room still to fit more repair materials.
- **7964**: Hmm... You've obviously erred on the side of caution, but the $3 can endure more punishment than this. As the saying goes, "No guts, no glory."
- **7965**: Here is your reward, pro rata with your performance. The need for repair materials is never-ending. We would appreciate your assistance as often as you can afford it.
- **7966**: The pulse martello and the clone wards are critical to the resistance effort, and must always be kept in prime condition. Your task involves transporting the materials necessary for their repair and maintenance from the stockpile to this location.
- **7967**: As we require a sizeable shipment of materials to be delivered, you will need to employ a pack chocobo.
- **7968**: There is one detail to keep in mind. Ever since the Abyssean hordes came to dominate the regional fauna, the birds have grown skittish and will bolt at the slightest provocation.
- **7969**: Should the pack chocobo become frightened and flee, the mission will be judged a failure. Needless to say, remuneration will not be awarded in this case.
- **7970**: Given the difficulties involved, you might wish to consider seeking the cooperation of others for this task.
- **7971**: Very well. I will send word to the chocobo tamer to have a bird readied.

- **7975**: Still determined to complete your task? Well then, carry on, soldier!
- **7976**: Hmph. Your failure has cost us a perfectly good pack chocobo. Do you have any idea how important the birds are to our cause? Plainly not...
- **7977**: Ah, you've returned. Without any ado, brief me on the outcome of your mission.
- **7978**: Amazing! That the chocobo came through it all virtually stress-free! You ought to be thoroughly commended, soldier.
- **7979**: So the chocobo survived the rigors of the mission in sound shape. Well done.
- **7980**: Hmm... In no worse shape than the birds that usually come back to us, I suppose.

- **8003**: Given the difficulties involved, you might wish to consider seeking the cooperation of others for this task.
- **8004**: Very well. I will send word to the chocobo tamer to have a bird readied.
- **8005**: Hand me your map. I will mark the stockpile's location upon it. Our soldiers are counting on the provisions. See that you do not dally.
- **8006**: What is it? Don't tell me you mean to abandon your mission.
- **8007**: You do the Resistance a great disservice. I will just have to consider it fortunate that a chocobo wasn't lost to the wilds.
- **8009**: Hmph. Your failure has cost us a perfectly good pack chocobo. Do you have any idea how important the birds are to our cause? Plainly not...
- **8010**: Ah, you've returned. Without any ado, brief me on the outcome of your mission.
- **8011**: Amazing! That the chocobo came through it all virtually stress-free! You ought to be thoroughly commended, soldier.
- **8012**: So the chocobo survived the rigors of the mission in sound shape. Well done.
- **8013**: Hmm... In no worse shape than the birds that usually come back to us, I suppose.
- **8014**: Hmm... The poor bird was subjected to considerable stress under your care. I would thank you to be more cautious in the future.
- **8015**: Here is your reward, pro rata with your performance. Our soldiers go through the ensorceled provisions as if there's no tomorrow...and that might just prove to be true. We would appreciate your assistance as often as you can afford it.
- **8016**: Enfeeblement traps have been laid within the perimeter in order to weaken would-be besiegers. This operation requires you to infuse a rear trap with $3, its energy source.
- **8017**: Due to the properties of the trap, you are required to be a certain distance away from it when performing the infusion.
- **8018**: The rear trap is designed to afflict hapless enemies with paralysis. As the potency of this effect is determined by the trap's energy store, it is imperative that the infusion is carried out with the utmost efficiency.
- **8019**: Very well. I shall issue you with $3.
- **8020**: What is it? Don't tell me you mean to abandon your mission.
- **8021**: You do the Resistance a great disservice. I will just have to consider it fortunate that valuable trap fluid wasn't put to waste.
- **8022**: Still determined to complete your task? Well then, carry on, soldier!
- **8023**: Hmph. Somehow I had foreseen this outcome. Do you have any idea how much of my sweat and tears go into producing a single dose of trap fluid? Plainly not...
- **8024**: Ah, you've returned. Without any ado, brief me on the outcome of your mission.
- **8025**: You were able to infuse the rear trap to the last drop? Amazing! You are to be thoroughly commended, soldier.
- **8026**: So you managed to infuse the rear trap with hardly any spillage. Well done.
- **8027**: Hmm... So you managed to infuse the rear trap without excess spillage. Though there's still room for improvement, to be sure.
- **8028**: Egads! Were your eyes even open during the process? Considering the amount of spillage, it's a wonder the infusion was even a success.
- **8029**: Here is your reward, pro rata with your performance. The traps play an essential role in our defenses. We would appreciate your assistance as often as you can afford it.
- **8030**: Enfeeblement traps have been laid within the perimeter in order to weaken would-be besiegers. This operation requires you to infuse a fore trap with $3, its energy source.
- **8031**: Due to the properties of the trap, you are required to be a certain distance away from it when performing the infusion.
- **8032**: The fore trap is designed to afflict hapless enemies with weakened attack. As the potency of this effect is determined by the trap's energy store, it is imperative that the infusion is carried out with the utmost efficiency.
- **8033**: Very well. I shall issue you with $3.
- **8034**: What is it? Don't tell me you mean to abandon your mission.
- **8035**: You do the Resistance a great disservice. I will just have to consider it fortunate that valuable trap fluid wasn't put to waste.

- **8043**: Here is your reward, pro rata with your performance. The traps play an essential role in our defenses. We would appreciate your assistance as often as you can afford it.
