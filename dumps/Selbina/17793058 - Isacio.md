## String References

- **6846**: Oh, it's you again. There is nothing more I can teach you. Now go, and may Altana smile upon you.
- **6847**: What? Oh... Hello, child. I'm just a feeble old man. Go and leave me be.
- **6848**: So, little [boy/girl], you want to be an adventurer, do you? Well, you've got a long way to go, I reckon.
- **6849**: I am glad that you seek my wisdom, child, but still you are too callow.
- **6850**: I, too, once took up arms for honor and country. But it was all in vain.
- **6851**: I helped defend the nation. I tasted glory. But behind their smiles people grew jealous. I lost my family, and my comrades deserted me.
- **6852**: Soon I realized that all I did, everything I fought for was in vain. I left the ranks for good.
- **6853**: But of late the beastmen rise in challenge. Again, many may lose dear friends and family to the storms of war.
- **6854**: I thought then of preventing such tragedy from happening again. Fortunately, an answer came to me.
- **6855**: I decided to teach my survival techniques to brave youths like yourself.
- **6856**: If you wish to learn them, you must prove your worthiness to me.
- **6857**: Are you ready? [You bet./Not now.]
- **6858**: Very well. First, bring me $0. I shall wait here.
- **6859**: 6 would be fine, too...if you can find one.
- **6860**: I see.
- **6861**: Well? Have you found $0?
- **6862**: Yes, this will do. I next desire $0.
- **6863**: Well done! Now for your final test. Bring me $0. Then you will gain what you desire.
- **6864**: Splendid. As promised, I will now instruct you in a most precious skill. I call it a "support job." Listen well to learn its secrets.
- **6865**: Support jobs are undertaken anywhere you normally change jobs. And you must already be proficient in a job before you can declare it your support job.
- **6866**: Furthermore, the effective level of your support job can never exceed half that of your main job. Also, since it is merely a support job, you'll never advance through experience.
- **6867**: I shall give an example. Let us say you have attained level 20 as a warrior and level 10 as a white mage. You would obviously declare your main job warrior, and your support job white mage.
- **6868**: In this example, you fight as a warrior of 20 levels and as a white mage 10 levels lower. Thus, you would be performing both jobs to their maximum potential.
- **6869**: In contrast, if you had declared white mage your main job and warrior your support job, things would be very different!
- **6870**: Since you would have only 10 levels of experience as a white mage, your potential as a warrior would be reduced to half that of your main job. Thus, 5! Not a wise decision, is it?
- **6871**: Similarly, you wouldn't want to make your support job something you've never done before. If your support job level is less than half that of your main job, your undeveloped skills would make not a difference. Remember this well!
- **6872**: I recommend you choose a support job that covers your main job's weaknesses, or one that enhances its strengths.
- **6873**: I realize there is much to remember, my pupil.
- **6874**: Do you understand all that I have told you? [Yes, I'm ready to go./Once more, please.]
- **6875**: Very good. Now, try your hand at a support job. You'll find it helpful in your journeys, I'm sure.
