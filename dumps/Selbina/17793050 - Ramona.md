## String References

- **6952**: Why, hello. My daughter and I are holding the fort again. Oh, that husband of mine's always out watching his precious sheep.
- **6953**: My daughter Mathilde married about five years ago. She gave us a grandson, and he's such a good little boy!
- **6954**: I always tell my husband how lucky we are!
- **6955**: But you see, Mathilde is adopted. Everyone says we get along better than most real families, though.
- **6956**: My husband found her out on a trade route when she was just a child, and brought her back home with him. I can't believe twenty years could go by so quickly!
- **6957**: The thing is, she had no memory of her past. She couldn't even remember her name. She didn't seem hurt anywhere, so she must have been through some terrible ordeal. Poor little thing...
- **6958**: My husband thinks her family was preyed upon by monsters, and she was the only survivor. The whole world was at war then, and such tragedies were commonplace.
- **6959**: She still remembers nothing about those times. Nothing, except for a certain boy's name. He must have been a very important person to her.
- **6973**: Good to see you. Once you reach my age, you'll realize that you have to work or you'll never get out of bed.
- **6974**: You've met Aldo, haven't you? Isn't he such a nice little boy? I always tell my husband how blessed we are for both a child and a grandchild!
- **7342**: Do we have a mannequin!? What do you think we are, crazy? Because that's what you'd have to be to have one of those cursed things in your shop!
- **7343**: Don't tell me you don't know what I'm talking about. Beastmen, [young boy/young girl]. Beastmen! I'd keep your whipper-snapping hands off those evil dolls unless you want to be robbed or kidnapped...or worse.
- **7344**: Why? Because my grandfather told me, that's why! You wouldn't be calling my grandfather a liar now, would you?
- **7345**: Wait a minute... If you really want to learn more about those goddessforsaken contraptions, I think I might have something that can help you.
- **7346**: Here, take this catalog. Oh, don't worry about reimbursing me. Even pictures of those mannequins give me the chills. I'm just glad to have them out of my sight!
- **7347**: You want to make one!? Well, it's your funeral. I heard they were made of wood, so there might be someone in San d'Oria that could help you. But that's all you'll get out of me.
