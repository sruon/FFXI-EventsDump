## String References

- **6720**: Oh, sorry... I was lost in thought.
- **6725**: Don't mind me. I have a lot to think about and... Huh? Oh, you've heard about my ring, have you?
- **6726**: I dropped it near the pier and it just... It was so dear to me. I don't know what to do.
- **6727**: I'd give anything to get my ring back. Anything! But the ocean has swallowed it forever. It's lost.
- **6741**: Yes, what is this? Goodness gracious! My ring! You found my precious ring! Thank you! Thank you so much!
- **6742**: You see, this is an engagement ring. My love dwells in Mhaura, and someday I shall offer this to her.
- **6743**: How could I forget my promise? This is but a mere token of my thanks, but take it; you've more than earned it!
- **6751**: Well? [Of course./Sorry, but I can't.]
- **6788**: Hello, how have you been? Haven't seen you for some time.
- **6789**: Me? Yes, I'm doing fine, thanks. But my girlfriend's just not feeling well at all.
- **6790**: I don't think she's sick, so I'm just having her eat nutritious things and hoping she starts feeling better soon.
- **6791**: I asked the cook at the inn for some help. He said he'd need some special ingredients, but there's no way I could get them!
- **6792**: You helped me out so much before, so maybe you could do just one more favor for me.
- **6793**: Thank you very much. He wanted $0.
- **6794**: They say they're really hard to come by. Take care, and best of luck to you.
- **6795**: Is that a fact? I wonder who could have the time to help me...
- **6796**: Say, this is $1! You found it. You really found it! Thank you so much! Now he can start on that dish!
- **6797**: This is all I have to give. Please, take it. You're our savior!
- **6798**: Oh, hello there. Thanks for helping me out then. My girlfriend was very grateful.
- **6799**: But she still isn't back to her old self. So, I started thinking some more...
- **6800**: I thought that maybe the real culprit is food itself! Once you eat something, it's gone, right?
- **6801**: And that's when I came up with this great idea for my next present...but I'll need a little help getting it.
- **6802**: Well, what do you say? Could I call upon you for yet another favor?
- **6803**: Oh, I see. But I really would prefer you! If you ever find the time to help me, please come back.
- **6804**: I know I might seem stubborn, but you're my only hope.
- **6805**: I heard about how you found the ring. You caught so many fish, and finally you found it inside one of them, right?
- **6806**: Well, since you're such a fine fisherman, I wanted to ask you to find $0 for me.
- **6807**: They say that $0 yield pearls. If I find one, I'm planning on having a boneworker fix it up for me.
- **6808**: Then I could give my girlfriend a fine pearl necklace. Well, don't you think she'd like it?
- **6809**: But without $0, I can't even begin. I wish I knew where they could be caught. If I knew someone who could tell me.
- **6810**: I have a feeling you'll figure something out. Please, do what you can.
- **6814**: Goodness, you found one! Thank you so much! Here, this is for you.
- **6815**: You're so fantastic! My girlfriend and I thank you from the bottom of our hearts.
- **6816**: Oh, hello again. Thanks for all you've done. My girlfriend was quite impressed with the necklace! The thing is, she said something rather odd.
- **6817**: She said, "Thanks for the gift, but what I want the most is you here next to me."
- **6818**: I didn't know what to say. Nobody's ever said such things to me!
- **6819**: Thanks to you, I feel like I've learned what's really important.
- **6820**: Now I know that she's the one. Thank you so much for all the help!
- **6821**: Oh, hello again. I can't believe I ever lost that ring. I won't let that happen again.
- **6822**: These days we traveling merchants fight for our survival. But we can't just give up our livelihood. After all, things weren't always like this.
- **6823**: I've been all over Vana'diel, but the inn here is my favorite. It's not the most luxurious place in the world, but I love the relaxed atmosphere.
