## String References

- **14909**: You there. I suppose you've heard the gossip flying around town--the talk of part-time ghosts?
- **14910**: Have you heard? [Yes, I've heard./Part-time ghosts!?]
- **14911**: Then we may move on to more important matters.
- **14912**: We haven't been able to locate enough volunteers to participate in this year's festivities, and are searching for adventurers who would be willing to aid us.
- **14913**: All you will be required to do is dress up in one of these frightening costumes and wander about the city with the other specters.
- **14914**: <Sigh>... Then allow me to explain.
- **14915**: A memorial is currently being held in honor of a long-lost coven of witches known as the Dark Lilies.
- **14916**: During the memorial, volunteers dressed up as the witches and spirits walk a course about the city in honor of the deceased.
- **14917**: However, while we have filled all the spots for the witches, we are quite short on people willing to play the part of the monsters who follow the Lilies.
- **14918**: Would you be willing to lend a hand, fine [sir/lady]?
- **14919**: Will you help? [Of course./Not a ghost of a chance.]
- **14920**: Ah... How droll. Please speak with me again if you change your mind.
- **14921**: Most excellent. There is one thing you must be aware of, however.
- **14922**: The witches have the most important role in this memorial service. You are to tread only in their wake. If it is found that you have stepped ahead of one of the Lilies, you will be asked to return your costume and leave the procession.
- **14923**: Though, we are a forgiving organization, and if you wish to participate once again, either speak with me or simply put on another costume and your request shall be granted.
- **14924**: Ah yes, and one more thing. There are two citizens playing the parts of the witches Guwanana and Bikho Ronpotteh.
- **14925**: You are to follow the fair Mithran maid dressed as Bikho. Remember this, as you will not receive any compensation in the event you join the wrong group.
- **14926**: Ah, welcome back, adventurer. You have done well. The Dark Lilies would be pleased.
- **14927**: Please take this as a token of our appreciation.
- **14928**: It is a hat modeled after those worn by the Dark Lilies. Perhaps you might wear it during the season's festivities.
- **14929**: Oh, and should you wish to aid us again, we would welcome your help. Many thanks, <Player>.
- **14930**: What has befallen you? Do you wish to give up?
- **14931**: Give up? [I'm done./Not yet.]
- **14932**: A pity. Please speak with me again if you change your mind.
- **14933**: You are to follow the young maiden dressed as Guwanana. Remember this, as you will not receive any compensation in the event you join the wrong group.
- **14979**: I shall let you know when there is another opening.
