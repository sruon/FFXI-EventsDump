## String References

- **7893**: You see a message engraved on the stone:
- **7894**: Drogaroga's Spine: Tarutaru for "Spine of the Heavenly Dragon." It is made of that same mysterious white material as the holy crags.
- **7895**: However, this is the first I've seen so exposed. A good portion of it is suspended in open space, no less.
- **7896**: In San d'Oria, the papsque claims that they were monuments built by Altana in honor of the Elvaan. All believed him, but I feel that this cannot be true.
- **7897**: This is merely conjecture, but I feel they resemble some kind of road or pipeline... But carrying what? If only I could show my father.
- **7898**: The white crags, spines, points, and lines... What did my father discover at the end of his journey? I wish I knew. --Enid Ironheart, 778 Crystal Era.
