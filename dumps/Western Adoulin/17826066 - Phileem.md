## String References

- **9909**: Altana's blessed light! That rugged face and those rippling muscles of yours are making me faint of breath! It was almost enough to make me overlook the hint of fatigue in those enchanting eyes.
- **9910**: What? Our coalition's maester? Why would you want to know about that haggard old biddy!?
- **9911**: There's nothing attractive about her...unless stinginess flips your switch. Personally, I think I'm much more fabulous than her. Tee hee!
- **9912**: Oh. My. Goddess. Look at that equipment ensemble! It looks fabulous on you...but I still think I'd wear it better.
- **9913**: Ugh, not our maester. The mere mention of her makes my hair stand on end!
- **9914**: All she ever thinks about is how much more bayld she can fit in those loose pockets of hers!
