## String References

- **7813**: Your $3 has been attuned to a geomagnetic fount[/ in Platea Triumphus (Couriers' Coalition)/ in front of the Pioneers' Coalition/ in front of the Mummers' Coalition/ in front of the Inventors' Coalition/ in front of the auction house/ in front of your Rent-a-Room/ by Big Bridge/ by the airship docks/ on the Adoulin Waterfront]!
- **8049**: Good day to you, adventurer! Have you registered with the Pioneers' Coalition yet? If not, I strongly recommend you take the time to do so at your earliest convenience!
- **8050**: Another day, another distraction, adventurer! Would you like to learn more about this splendiferous machine here?
- **8051**: Any interest in the device? [You betcha!/Not particularly.]
- **8052**: Aww, and I had my script all planned out, too! If you ever change your mind, you know where to find me!
- **8053**: This is a magical apparatus referred to as a "waypoint." You can use it to instantaneously teleport to anywhere in Western Adoulin.
- **8054**: Oh ho, forgive me for babying you. Of course you know that much--you probably used one to get here!
- **8055**: As you can imagine, it's quite a convenient little invention, but I'd only try going places you've visited before, if I were you.
- **8056**: <Mutter> Some idiots try to go places they've never heard of and get their heads all turned around...
- **8057**: Oops--looks like my inner monologue slipped out again. I'm sure you can imagine what a pain it must be to guide the lost back home. Twaha!
- **8058**: All joking aside, if you don't have $6 attuned to where you want to go, the thing just won't work!
- **8059**: More precisely, it's not the location itself so much as the magnetic fields located there. So, to make things more convenient in the long run, you'll want to walk from place to place and attune your $3.
- **8060**: Once it's attuned, you're free to zip around as you please. So why dillydally? Let's get started with this one right here!
- **8061**: That wasn't a suggestion. More of an order. Well, "order" might be a bit harsh. Maybe "request"? Yes, let's go with "request."
- **8062**: See? Now you're playing with portals! But seriously--you'll save yourself a lot of headaches down the road if you just get it over with now.
- **8063**: What's this? You've attuned to this spot already? Gee, you're quicker on the uptake than I'd have thought!
- **8064**: The pioneer way of life is difficult enough without having to worry about travel, so we set up these waypoints to make things as easy as possible.
- **8065**: Hut-tut! Your task isn't done yet! Find those waypoints! Gotta attune 'em all!
- **8066**: Let me see that thing. Maybe I can tell you which waypoints remain.
- **8067**: The center of Western Adoulin. That would be...right here! The place you're looking for is just in front of the Couriers' Coalition in Platea Triumphus.
- **8068**: I'm sure you can see it from here--that weird...no, unique...fountain over in that plaza? It's right there!
- **8069**: Just north of Platea Triumphus, near the airships. That's not so bad, right?
- **8070**: This one's located faaar away at the northern edges of Western Adoulin. My calves are burning just thinking about walking there! Well...that's what the waypoints are for!
- **8071**: Head north past Platea Triumphus. But don't go too far, or you'll reach the airship docks. There's this downward slope on your left along the way. That's your target!
- **8072**: By the waterfront, just down that slope. What would a city known for maritime trading be without a bustling waterfront?
- **8073**: Head straight east from Platea Triumphus. There's one located just in front of Big Bridge. If you're feeling adventurous, you can cross the bridge to reach Eastern Adoulin, where the castle is.
- **8074**: Hmm...take the streets to the southwest of Platea Triumphus to find this one. It's located just in front of the auction house. Promise me you won't spend all your gil when you get there, hm? After all that work you did to get here in the first place...
- **8075**: Let's see. There's one located to the south of Platea Triumphus. It's where the Rent-a-Rooms await for all your adventuring needs. Come to think of it, why are you asking me this? You mean you haven't even been there yet!?
- **8076**: This one is located southeast of Platea Triumphus. You'll find there the pride and joy of all Adoulin--the Inventors' Coalition. The road runs pretty deep there, so make sure you can find your way back out! I don't want to have to come get you!
- **8077**: South of Platea Triumphus, that one. You'll want to turn right along the path to the Mog Resort. You should pop by the Mummers' Coalition--that's your goal! Might as well catch some R&R while you're there, too!
- **8078**: So hey, congratulations on getting all the waypoints! I won't say you set a world record for speed, but it is what it is. This should make your travels through Adoulin a breeze!
- **8079**: By the by, have you heard of this guy Anastase?
- **8080**: That old fart--well, perhaps I should be respectful, because he IS my grandfather--was treated with great love and care by the people of the Middle Lands. I know you probably didn't have anything to do with that, but I just wanted to let you know how grateful I am for the kindness of your people.
- **8081**: Hey, how goes the whole pioneering thing? You making sure to use those waypoints? Things are tough enough out there, so no reason to make life harder on yourself!
- **8106**: A good day to you, good [sir/madam]. Have you found the waypoints useful in your pioneering activities? They have been set up for your convenience, so do not hesitate to use them as you see fit.
- **8107**: While I have your attention--have I told you of my most oppressive grandfather, who is working with the waypoints in the Middle Lands?
- **8108**: The old coot will not be back for a while, so naturally I am worried about his well-being. Can I ask a small favor of you?
- **8109**: Listen to her story? [Sure./I've got better things to do.]
- **8110**: I see. I suppose you have no reason to help me, but...if you ever change your mind, I will be here waiting.
- **8111**: You have my thanks. I have prepared some traditional Adoulinian cuisine for him, as he must surely miss the fine taste of his homeland.
- **8112**: I am also interested in hearing how those odd fellows--his surveying party, that is--are getting along. You see, their families are stricken with worry, and I made a promise to check up on them.
- **8113**: Your aid is greatly appreciated. Oh dear--I forgot to tell you my grandfather's name: Anastase.
- **8114**: My dear pioneer, I have cooked up a lovely Adoulinian meal for my grandfather. Could I trouble you to bring it to him?
- **8115**: Deliver a meal for her? [In a jiffy!/Sorry. Too busy.]
- **8116**: I know this may sound rude, but please do be careful with this dish, for I put all my familial love into cooking it.
- **8117**: My grandfather and his entourage are doing well? This is wonderful news, indeed. My gratitude knows no bounds.
- **8118**: I can never stop worrying about him, so I might ask you to bring some more of my home cooking to him later--if you are free, that is.
