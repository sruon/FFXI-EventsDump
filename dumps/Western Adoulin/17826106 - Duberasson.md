## String References

- **11481**: A.M.A.N. has been pulling out all the stops recently, would you not agree? Maybe I should get in tune with this new "Records of Eminence" thing they have created.
- **11482**: What? The Love and Peace Coalition? Why would you think that is real for even a moment?
- **11483**: Eternal Flame is simply looking for someone at whom to talk. None of the locals can stand his absurdities, so he has fallen to preying on unsuspecting pioneers.
- **11484**: You there.
- **11485**: I heard from Eternal Flame that you are to thank for reuniting his party.
- **11486**: Perhaps you could give me some peace of mind as well. Would you mind listening to my story?
- **11487**: Listen to his story? [Why not?/No, I can't take any more.]
- **11488**: Very well. At least allow me to say this, however. Thank you for making this dark world a little brighter.
- **11489**: It all started back when I could hardly tell a saber from a scimitar.
- **11490**: I was roaming the woods of West Ronfaure when I was ambushed by Orcish reconnaissance. There was no hope for my survival, and I had resigned myself to my fate.
- **11491**: However, before they could inflict the final blow upon me, I was blanketed in a comforting light.
- **11492**: The wounds that rendered me nothing more than a bloody hunk of meat closed before my eyes. I felt as if I had the strength to fell a whole horde of Orcs, and succeeded handily in dispatching my aggressors.
- **11493**: At the battle's conclusion, I turned to face the source of that warm light. What my eyes met with was a certain Tarutaru white mage.
- **11494**: Her face said it all. Altruism itself seemed to have manifested upon her countenance, and the nonchalant glance she gave froze me in place. I knew my life had changed at that moment.
- **11495**: I immediately discarded my sword and hastened to Regine's Magicmart, where I outfitted myself in all the trappings of a white mage.
- **11496**: I began to tread the path of healing, determined not only to return the favor she had bestowed upon me, but also to make her recognize my proclivity for the craft.
- **11497**: Once I had whetted my appetite for the standard fare of sorcery, I decided to refine my palate by embarking for Castle Oztroja.
- **11498**: My quest to slay those unholy Yagudo acolytes took me deep within the bowels of the heap of dirt and rock they called a castle. While the journey was fraught with many dangers, it was worth it to procure spells the likes of which I had only conceptualized up until then.
- **11499**: With this, my role model would be unable to deny my puissance. She would shower me with praise that would validate my long excursion and prove how consummate my adoption of the white arts truly was.
- **11500**: Sadly, though, the truth is a fickle mistress.
- **11501**: I later learned from Eternal Flame that of all people in Vana'diel...
- **11502**: ...the very girl who saved my life was one of his partners in adventure.
- **11503**: The beacon of light who had shown me the way, my raison d'etre...
- **11504**: ...the Tarutaru with whom I wanted nothing more than to tell what she meant to me...
- **11505**: ...I was pushing her away from myself all along by working to become the white mage I am today.
- **11506**: If I had not been so devoted to this calling, she would have had more opportunities to join Flame's party and I could have come face-to-face with her.
- **11507**: I cursed Lady Fortune. How could I not, when my good intentions effectively drove a wedge between me and the dame?
- **11508**: Perhaps I should not dwell on what has come to pass, seeing as you have brought a smile to her face once more. I feel as if an incredible weight has been launched from my shoulders into the sky.
- **11509**: Speaking of which, you lit that ouka ranman in $8, did you not?
- **11510**: Maybe I should return to West Ronfaure and light my own petals of recollection.
- **11511**: I indeed must perform some introspection. What does it mean to live as an adventurer? Why do I risk my life every day to be one?
- **11512**: Whether or not I find any answers there, I am greatly indebted to you.
- **11513**: Should you ever have the occasion to visit Jeuno, would you do me the favor of seeing how my dear white mage fares?
