## String References

- **9792**: Be you another of them would-be pioneers, filled with aspirations and promise? Then saunter on over to the back, there. We'll get you all set up.
- **9793**: Feeling down? Well save the waterworks for the Waterways, as I always say! Wipe away the tears, here comes the cheer: If we all work together, we can change the continent for the better! Hmmm...still needs some work, I guess.
- **9794**: If you ever happen to cross paths with the leader of our coalition, don't speak unless you're spoken to. The amount of work she piles on people is enough to turn the sunniest summer afternoon into the dreariest of winter nights.
- **11340**: You want documents about the formation of Adoulin? Hahaha, it looks like we've got a dilettante on our hands.
- **11341**: That industrious spirit of yours has really captured my eye. Just between you and me, why don't I give you something privy only to coalition members?
- **11342**: Lessee... I'm pretty sure it was...yes, the alliance agreement.
- **11343**: "In signing this referendum, the leaders of the Twelve Orders hereby consent to the formation of a union for the express purpose of governing the Sacred City of Adoulin Alliance."
- **11344**: This document was drafted approximately one hundred years ago, but another hundred or so years before that, the landscape was quite different. There were multitudinous small nation-states, governed by the order leaders, and they all participated in a colonization race of sorts.
- **11345**: Why bother with this whole colonization effort? Simple. The resources discovered while pioneering contribute to the wealth and self-sufficiency of the nation. Finding productive soil also increases the quality of crop yields.
- **11346**: The colonization effort is such a wonderful thing. In truth, I can't state that loud enough. It's the best thing that ever happened to me!
- **11347**: So is this city. If I were to list my five favorite places in Adoulin, I'd start with the Adoulin Waterfront! Looking down on it from up high gives you possibly the best scenery you've ever witnessed in your life! It's certainly worth billions of bayld, as the saying goes.
- **11348**: My fourth favorite would have to be the Mummers' Coalition. A limitless paradise awaits within, and temptations abound--from the plethora of attractions to the--
- **11349**: Sorry, I didn't mean to ramble like that. Don't forget to show your face around here from time to time.
