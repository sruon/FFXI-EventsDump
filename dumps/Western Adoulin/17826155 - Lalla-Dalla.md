- **12088**: Sometimes you need to just stop and smell the sweet aroma of entertainment. How about engaging in a rousing game of "Guess That Number"?
- **12089**: I urge you to indulge in as many of Adoulin's pastimes as possible. While I may perhaps be taking it out of context, I do believe there is an adage that states "the more the merrier"--especially when it comes to "Boom or Bust".
- **12090**: I know what you're thinking. "I need this dame to better understand the flow of time." Well then, let me be your partner in a round of "On The Dot"?
- **12091**: If you seek a true test of your abilities, I would be more than happy to give my all against you in "Cascade."

- **12143**: Fancy yourself an accomplished lockpicker? Then test your skills by deciphering combinations within the set amount of tries and make all the [ladies/gents] swoon!
- **12144**: All locks have two digits, which you'll have to deduce by remembering the numbers you've guessed. A little intuition gained from examining them never hurt, either.

- **12182**: It appears that you can enter a two-digit combination between $1 and $2.

- **12184**: Either you or I may choose to "shoot" and roll the dice, "stay" and do nothing, or pick from three tricks up your sleeve.
- **12185**: The three tricks in your arsenal of deception include "Sneak Peek," which allows you to see your opponent's shots, using the old "Switcheroo" and trading shots with your opponent, or forcing your opponent to reroll a shot of his choice with "Crooked Die."
- **12186**: These three tricks will spin the wheel of fortune in your favor, but it is precisely because of their immense powers that we must limit their use to once per game.
- **12187**: Make sure you attempt to turn the tables at the right time, or Lady Luck will be the one cleaning house.
- **12188**: You shot a $2, for a total of $3 on turn number $1.

- **12191**: [You/Your opponent] [shot/stayed].
- **12192**: What will you do? [Shoot./Stay./Use a trick up my sleeve./Fold.]
- **12193**: Which trick will you use? [None, I've changed my mind./Sneak Peek./Switcheroo./Crooked Die.]

[???/1/2/3/4/5/6]/Shot eleven. [???/1/2/3/4/5/6]]
- **12195**: You snuck a peek at one of your opponent's dice! Shot number $1 was a $2 for him.
- **12196**: You used the old switcheroo! Your $1 has been exchanged with your opponent's $2, and your total is now $3.
- **12197**: You forced your opponent to shoot again! His shot for turn number $1 is now $2.

- **12200**: Clear your mind and ready your chronological senses, for this amusement pits you against time's dilatory creep. The objective here's to speak to me a certain amount of times at the intervals I tell you.
- **12201**: Just so you know, I'll only give you the length of time to wait and how far off you were from the specified interval when spoken to. Furthermore, the difference between your guess and the answer is cumulative.
- **12202**: If you're too slow one round, you can make up time by being a little fast the next.
- **12203**: Finally, you claim victory by staying within a certain number of seconds by the end of the final round. I hope this cleared things up, and enjoy honing your mastery over Father Time.
- **12204**: I take it that means you're in the correct state of mind to challenge the forces of time. Let's do this!
- **12207**: It's judgment time! You were [a total of /a total of /]$1 second[/s] [early./late./off. In other words, perfectly on-target!] [It seems that the concept of time eludes you./Congratulations, you've temporarily mastered the forces of time!]
- **12208**: A wet and wild adventure, this. You and I take turns filling a goblet with water until the cup runneth over, with the offending competitor sent to drown in shame.
- **12209**: The rub is that it looks as if there is more water in the goblet than actually exists. Thus you will need to exercise the entirety of your patience and perspicacity to wrench victory from my clutches.
- **12210**: As if that were not enough, I have added an extra layer of frustration by granting us competitors certain abilities dubbed "afflictions" and "remedies."
- **12211**: On the one hand, afflictions allow you to do such things as change the amount of water I see.
- **12212**: You can also use them to negate the effects of my remedies or limit the amount of water I can pour.
- **12213**: On the other hand, remedies help increase or decrease either the amount of the water you can pour or the amount of water in the goblet. As a final twist, they can also negate the effects of afflictions.
- **12214**: Afflictions and remedies cause the tides of competition to surge and swell to an extreme degree, so we restrict their use to once per game. Be prudent with which you use and when.
- **12215**: What will you do? [Pour away!/Use an affliction./Use a remedy./Throw in the towel.]
- **12216**: How will you afflict your opponent? [I won't, that's how./Increase amount poured./Decrease amount poured./Fabricate water level./Remove a remedy./Restrict to greater pouring options./Restrict to lesser pouring options.]
- **12217**: What remedy will you use? [None, that's what!/Increase amount poured./Decrease amount poured./Cure an affliction./Increase maximum water level./Decrease maximum water level.]
- **12218**: Pour how much? (Currently $1 onz[/es].) [One onz./Two onzes./Three onzes./Four onzes./Five onzes.]
- **12219**: [You used an affliction on Etienne./You used a remedy on yourself./You cured an affliction.]
- **12220**: [You/Etienne] poured water into the goblet. There [is/are] currently $1 onz[/es] of water in it.
- **12221**: [You/Etienne] poured water into the goblet, causing it to overflow. [You have bested your challenger. Claim what is yours by lapping the tears of defeat from his face and tasting the glorious sorrow contained within./How does complete and utter defeat feel? Will you even be able to sleep once night falls?]
- **12224**: Even pioneers like you seeking refuge in amusements can't escape the time's inevitable ticking. The last time you played this game, you were disqualified for exceeding the time limit.
- **12263**: How many do you wish to receive? [None./$1./$2./$3./$4./$5./$6./$7./$8./$9./$10./$11./$12.]
- **12264**: You wish to purchase $3 $0$0 ? Then I shall require $2 [fragment/mweya plasm corpuscle/medal/bayld clump][/s].
- **12290**: I know your type. You're one of those pioneer-wioneers who likes to try [his/her] luck. Well, then, there is no more appropriataru game for you in all of Adoulin than the oft-lauded Box...of...Fortune!
- **12291**: What makes this game so greataru is that it requires not a lick of skill whatsoever.
- **12292**: An egalitarian-warian roll of the dice determines which of the $1 treasure chests you'll open. Depending on the trove inside, you'll get somewhere between a handful and a mountain of mummers' medals.
- **12293**: The three types of ticketarus to wealth that dwell inside chests are: crystals such as $2, spirits like $3, and jewels the likes of $4.
- **12294**: Crystals are the condensed-wensed form of $5 medal[/s], spirits scare $6 medal[/s] into your clutches, and jewels glintaru with the power of $7 medal[/s].
- **12295**: What's more, unboxing a jewel immediataruly puts you on a hot streak more scorching-worching than the fires of Moh Gates.
- **12296**: Once you're on a hot streak, you have a high chance of revealing more jewels, but all good things must come to an end. Should either a crystal or spirit pop out from a chestaru, your flames get doused.
- **12297**: Now, you're free to stop playing anytime you wish, but I wouldn't recommend doing it while you're on a hot streak. It would mean snuffing-wuffing out your streak faster than a chapuli's horn can slice through your legs.
- **12298**: No funny stuff here, just a plain-wain roll of the dice.
- **12299**: The chest opens to reveal $1! You win $2 mummers' medal[/s]!
- **12300**: Welcome to the wonderful arena that is "Three-Card Circus." I, Olivaine, will be your ringmistress.
- **12301**: To win this greatest amusement on Vana'diel, you must collect suit and number combinations of the three cards you are dealt. Each card will be imprinted with one of four suits and six numbers.
- **12302**: It is possible to trade in a maximum of three times, and the amount of cards you draw is equal to the number you discard. Of course, it is acceptable to step down from exchanging should you feel you are walking on a tightrope.
- **12303**: As for the combinations, each one is worth a different number of points. In the event that all three of your cards display different numbers, only the largest one shall count toward your point total.
- **12304**: If you possess a pair, you gain a number of points equal to twice the number of your remaining card.
- **12305**: Furthermore, should you have three of a kind, you will receive fifty points regardless of the cards' number.
- **12306**: Additionally, having cards of all the same suit gives you points equal to twice the total of the numbers on the cards in your hand.
- **12307**: Lastly, should the numbers on your cards total eleven, you will receive three times the amount of points.
- **12308**: %[Your/Olivaine's] hand consists of: A [oo!/o"/o$]$9, a [oo!/o"/o$]$10, and a [oo!/o"/o$]$11.
- **12309**: What will you do? [View your hand./Trade in./View discard pile./Listen to an explanation./Stop trading.]
- **12310**: The following cards have been discarded.

- **12313**: %[You have/Olivaine has] chosen not to trade in.
- **12314**: %[You/Olivaine] discard%[/s] a [oo!/o"/o$]$9 and draw%[/s] $& card[/s]!
- **12315**: %[You/Olivaine] discard%[/s] a [oo!/o"/o$]$9 and a [oo!/o"/o$]$10, then draw%[/s] $& card[/s]!
- **12316**: %[You/Olivaine] discard%[/s] a [oo!/o"/o$]$9, a [oo!/o"/o$]$10, and a [oo!/o"/o$]$11, then draw%[/s] $& card[/s]!
