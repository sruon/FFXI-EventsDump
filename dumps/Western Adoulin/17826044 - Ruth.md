## String References

- **7896**: What do you need, hon?
- **7897**: Ah, so Merleg wants you to show him the power of an ionis.
- **7898**: You know how children are at that age. They're just very excited about becoming pioneers and working for certain coalitions. I think it's wonderful that they're showing an interest in their hometown.
- **7899**: Merleg and some of the other children even walk around town pretending to keep the city safe. They call themselves the "Fantastic Adoulin Imperial Liberators."
- **7900**: Sometimes we have to tell them to tone it down and keep out of trouble, but for the most part--
- **7901**: Oh, my! Where are my manners? You came to have Ionis cast on you, didn't you?
- **7902**: May the founder king's undying love protect you this day!
- **7903**: Now you're now outfitted with an ionis. Go back and give those children the show of their lives!
- **9766**: I have been ordered by the Grand Chancellor to assist any pioneers in need.
- **9767**: Hmmm... Taking another look at you, though, it doesn't seem like you're even registered.
- **9768**: If you'd like to be a part of this virtuous movement to lead Adoulin to prosperity, just traipse on down the main thoroughfare here until you see a sign with a shovel on it to your left.
- **9769**: That's the Pioneers' Coalition. Head in and speak to Brenton so he can get you set up with all you need to start colonizing the continent!
- **9770**: The more developed the continent becomes and the more you contribute to the pioneering effort, the more services the coalitions will provide!
- **9771**: They'll also look much grander, if you're a fan of architecture and such things. Either way, you've so much to gain by helping the coalitions, so please do!
