## String References

- **7393**: You look like you're freezing, [mister/lady]!
- **7394**: Now, if you had some gloves like the ones I'm wearing, your fingers'd be warmer than Galkan sausages fresh out of the fire! Gah hah hah haw!
- **7395**: Now, if you had some boots like the ones I'm wearing, you wouldn't have to worry about your feet turning as blue as a Bastokan flag! Gwah hah hah haw!
- **7396**: You've heard of Bearclaw Pinnacle, right? It's just beyond Thousandfall Ridge...but I don't think that you've got what it takes to make it into the deeper parts.
- **7397**: Now, if you fill this bag with the Chamnaet ice found in those caves throughout the ridge, I might consider helping you out. What do you say?
- **7398**: Eh? Why do I need so much ice? You don't go worrying yourself with the details, [mister/lady]. You fetch some, you're in. You don't, you're out in the cold. Gwah hah har haw!
- **7399**: Well, what do you know? The adventurer made it back in one piece. Let me take a look at this bag... Oh yeah... A cube of this in my Opo-opo brew and I'll be in heav--
- **7400**: Ahem! Eh, um... The bravery exhibited in completing this task has convinced me of your...um...bravery! You have proven yourself worthy enough to battle the terrible beast that lies beyond the swirling winds of the pinnacle.
- **7401**: Just remember, it doesn't show its face that often, so if you're crazy enough to want to go again, you might have to wait a while.
- **7402**: Anyway, take this. It's pretty old, and you'll probably only be able to use it once, but I guarantee it will get you to where you want to go.
- **7403**: Hm? You want to go back to Bearclaw Pinnacle? I don't know why you would. There's nothing to see there now.
- **7404**: That beast probably won't come out of its cave until ( Earth time), if it even comes out at all!
- **7405**: Of course, if you're not going there for fun, but for "business," then you probably don't need my help to get in anyway!
