## String References

- **7889**: The damage is even worse than we feared. If another one hits, it might mean the end for...
- **7890**: Yes? Is there something you need?
- **7891**: Ah, so you overheard my musings. Avalanches have been occurring with disturbing frequency in the eastern reaches of the range, you see, and I took it upon myself to uncover the cause.
- **7892**: And what do you suppose that cause might be? If you said earthquakes, you'd be correct!
- **7893**: It would seem that periodic tremors centered around an area due east of Bearclaw Pinnacle are causing accumulated snow to be displaced in mass quantities. Fortunately, I've devised a plan to mitigate the damage.
- **7894**: By periodically triggering small explosions before the snow has had a chance to accumulate, we can ensure that any avalanche that occurs is little but a harmless sluff.
- **7895**: There's only one catch. It's quite a perilous trek to the area where the explosives must be placed, and I injured my leg in the most recent snowslide. Would you be willing to perform the task in my stead?
- **7896**: Help out? [Certainly./Certainly not.]
- **7897**: A generous soul you are indeed. I shall entrust you with this set of three $3--explosive devices that I've modified to be especially effective in displacing snow.
- **7898**: That's a shame. Well, perhaps my bum leg still has a few malms left in it... Unggghhh...or maybe not.
- **7899**: Through careful research, I have pinpointed three locations due east of Bearclaw Pinnacle where snowfall accumulates readily. It is there that I believe the explosions would achieve maximum effect.
- **7900**: All you need do is travel to each spot, prepare a $5 by loading its chamber with a suitable quantity of firesand, then bury it within the snowdrift. Do this thrice and your job is done.
- **7901**: How much firesand will suffice, you ask? An excellent question, but one to which there is no simple answer.
- **7902**: In areas of significant buildup, a small blast should be sufficient to set things in motion. A more potent explosion will be required in those places where accumulation is yet sparse. The exact quantity you will have to determine on your own. This is still a very inexact science, I'm afraid.
- **7903**: I will be handling the detonation remotely, so you need only report back to me when the mines have been loaded and set. That is, unless you have a burning desire to come tumbling down the slopes encased in a raging juggernaut of snow and ice. Ahahaha!
- **7910**: Your work's complete, is it? Wonderful! Well then, here goes nothing. Look out beloooooow!
- **7911**: Now if you'll excuse me a moment, I'll contact our lookout. (Furan-Furin? Furan-Furin, do you read me?)
- **7913**: It would seem [the blast was a bit on the weak side. Still, we've/we were right on the mark. We've/we may have overdone it a bit. Still, we've] gathered valuable data from this.
- **7914**: Feel proud, friend, for you've performed a great service for the survivors of Uleguerand today. Take this for your troubles!
- **7917**: Thanks to you, we've gathered valuable data. But our research is far from complete. We'd be much obliged if you could assist us again someday.
- **7919**: Our lookout says we've got significant snow accumulation east of the pinnacle. At this rate, it's only a matter of time until another avalanche strikes. Would you be kind enough to help us set some $3 again?
