## String References

- **8149**: A sharp pair of eyes you have there, friend. Don't travel too far. I may have need of you before long.
- **8150**: A sharp pair of eyes you have there, friend. Yes, I believe I have just the job for you.
- **8151**: Feast those eyes of yours upon this parchment. These are plans for harnessing the fearsome explosive power of snolls, recovered from Xarcabard by my father during the Great War.
- **8152**: After the cataclysm, I made it my life's work to see this project to fruition, that we might strike back at the hordes with the shattering force of a thousand avalanches.
- **8153**: After months of painstaking research, all that stands between me and success is one final detonation experiment. An experiment in which you will be graciously serving as my assistant.
- **8154**: Worry not, friend. The experiment will pose little risk to your well-being...if conducted properly, that is.
- **8155**: So pray listen carefully. First, I will be entrusting you with a high-precision instrument.
- **8156**: You are to take it and make your way to the testing site located due north of here.
- **8157**: When you arrive, you are to set it--$6, I call it--at the designated point of impact. Upon doing so, you will soon observe that snolls are drawn to its presence.
- **8158**: The $3 emits a light that, while invisible to our eyes, will affect the snoll in myriad ways. In addition to attracting their attention, it will also disrupt their internal biological workings, accelerating the process known as hypothermal combustion.
- **8159**: You are to make skillful use of this instrument and trigger an explosion as close to the impact point as possible.
- **8160**: Setting off explosions haphazardly will serve only to waste time and resources that we do not have. I have put down detailed instructions in writing to ensure that the experiment will proceed as intended.
- **8161**: When your work is done, retrieve the $3 and deliver it back to me.
- **8162**: I would collect the data myself if I could, but alas! The infirm body of a researcher is ill-suited for manual labor.
- **8163**: You are not the only one who has graciously agreed to aid in my work. Should you come across any of my other assistants in the field, you will no doubt find it beneficial to work as a team.
- **8164**: I await word of your success. Go in safety!
- **8165**: Ah, there you are, friend! Allow me to examine your $3.
- **8166**: ...
- **8167**: Marvelous! It would seem the experiment was a success beyond even my wildest expectations! I truly cannot thank you enough.
- **8168**: Of course, my work is not yet complete. There are still improvements and adjustments to be made.
- **8169**: Promise me that I can count on your aid again.
- **8170**: ...I see. While not an outright failure, it would seem there is still considerable room for improvement.
- **8171**: The experiment was a failure!? You cannot be serious!
- **8172**: Fortunately, I have a spare set of instruments. Take this, and do try to be more careful this time.
- **8173**: Ah, there you are! And your timing could not be better. I am pleased to announce that preparations for my latest experiment are complete.
- **8174**: I trust you remember the procedure?
- **8175**: Do you remember? [Of course!/Uh, actually...]
