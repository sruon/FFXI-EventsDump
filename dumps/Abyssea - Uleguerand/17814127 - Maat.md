## String References

- **8110**: Heh heh heh. These fiends pack a nasty punch, don't they?
- **8111**: Well, that means we just gotta punch back even harder! Go give 'em hell! Heh!
- **8112**: Looks like our foe's sportin' a few bruises.
- **8113**: You're puttin' up a good fight. Good thing, too, 'cause these old bones need a rest from time to time.
- **8114**: You've still got your youth, though, so keep poundin' away! Heh heh heh!
- **8115**: Good work! I do believe we've got the fiends on the run.
- **8116**: But this is no time to let up. We can't give 'em any opening to get back in the fight.
- **8117**: Good work, young'un. Our enemy's battered and bloodied.
- **8118**: Now's our time to hit 'em with all we've got. Let's leave 'em with bruises they'll carry to their graves! Heh!
- **8119**: Looks like we've given those fiends such a beatin' that they've all gone cryin' home to their mommies. Heh heh heh!
- **8120**: We may have won this bout, but don't even think about lettin' down your guard. Those fiends are nothin' if not unpredictable.
