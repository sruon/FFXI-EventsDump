## String References

- **8179**: 'Twould appear that precision sliding on sheer-faced cliffs of solid ice is not such an easy task, after all...
- **8180**: Wait, do not tell me. <Player>, is it not? Your reputation precedes you.
- **8181**: Perhaps you might be of service to us. Are you perchance familiar with Thousandfall Ridge?
- **8182**: A positively frightening land formation that has claimed the life of many a careless traveler, it is, and reported to contain a breeding ground for the hordes beneath the surface.
- **8183**: I have decided to send a regiment to clear out this foul den. The rub is that it is remarkably difficult to reach, requiring a precision cliff-sliding operation that is nigh impossible to perform unassisted.
- **8184**: It would be a great help to us if you could assist my scouts with their landing procedure.
- **8185**: As you may know, there are two slopes suitable for sliding.
- **8186**: Stationed at the southern and western slopes you will find two of my men, Nachou and Perfaumand.
- **8187**: They alone have successfully navigated this treacherous course thus far.
- **8188**: Speak with them, and they will surely have invaluable advice for you.
- **8189**: Which slope you assist with is a choice I leave entirely to you. Now go forth and serve the Resistance, <Player>!
- **8190**: You've returned. How go your efforts?
- **8191**: I see. This may not be much, but please accept it as a token of our gratitude.
- **8192**: I intend to send another unit into the breach before long. I would be honored if you could assist us again.
- **8193**: I see. 'Tis unfortunate, but not entirely unexpected.
- **8194**: My men are making the long trek back up the mountain as we speak. There is naught to do but wait for their return.
- **8195**: Ah, a familiar face.
- **8196**: We are in need of your assistance in sending another unit into Thousandfall Ridge. Pray head to the slopes, and quickly.
