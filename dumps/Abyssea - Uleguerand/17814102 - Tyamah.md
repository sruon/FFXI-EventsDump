## String References

- **7942**: (I could tell you what I'm doing here, but then I'd have to kill you. And I don't suppose you'd enjoy that very much.)
- **7943**: You'd do well not to meddle in my affairs if you... ...Wait a minute.
- **7944**: Yes...perhaps you could be of service to me. What say you?
- **7945**: Offer your aid? [Gladly./I think not.]
- **7946**: Excellent. You may call me Tyamah. And you are <Player>, correct?
- **7947**: How do I know your name...? I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. That wouldn't be pleasant--at least not for you--so let's just get down to business.
- **7948**: I have been charged with investigating the current condition of the four nations of Altana...or what remains of them.
- **7949**: By whom and for what reason are matters not of your concern. I seek of you answers, not questions.
- **7950**: No matter how inconsequential they may appear to your untrained eyes, any and all details are vital to those who employ my services. Uncover what you can, and I will see that you are rewarded for your efforts.
- **7955**: Well? Was your reconnaissance mission a fruitful one? I hope it was...for your sake...
- **7956**: ...I see. I had my own suspicions, but this...
- **7957**: It would seem that not even the Empire is safe. And yet, I have no way to...<ahem>. But this is none of your concern.
- **7958**: At any rate, you've made yourself most useful. Take this in return.
- **7959**: I would not have expected to find a [brother/sister] of the path on these distant shores. Though it does little to avail us now...
- **7960**: Please leave me alone with my thoughts for a while. Unless you'd like me to kill you. That could be arranged.
- **7961**: You...! What was your name again!? Tyamah? No...that was...someone else... Bah! What difference does it make?
- **7962**: I have a task for you...for anyone! I need $0...$0 of the most abnormal, unnatural Abyssean fiends!
- **7963**: Strange blobs suspended in midair! Snails that swim in the sky instead of the water! And more...yes, more... Where did they come from, and what do they want from me!? You must bring me their $0...and soon...
- **7964**: Who said I needed your help!? What? I did!? Ah...then take $1 and some $0 out of those trunks you see there.
- **7965**: Equip yourself with a fiend and use it on the $0. Or was it the other way around...?
- **7966**: What happened to me since we last met? Why, nothing! Nothing at all! I am in purrrfect command of my facul-waculties, kupo! Really, the nerve of you!
- **7967**: ...Now where did I put my turban!?
- **7968**: You won't help me? Help me do what? Who are you, anyway!?
- **7969**: Yes! Yes, this is one of the unholy creatures that calls to me in my sleep! But there are more! Yes, still more! What do they want from me!?
- **7970**: No, this is not one of the creatures that speaks to me in my dreams. It is far too...ordinary. You must...find them. They wait for me even as we speak!
- **7971**: What's this? You already gave me one of these! Have you gone completely daft? Good thing one of us still has his wits about him! Bwahahaha!
- **7972**: Even I'm not crazy enough to figure out what this is supposed to be. You'll have to try again.
- **7973**: Yes, these are unmistakably the fiends that I was looking for...
- **7974**: I must immediately report back to... Who was I working for, again?
- **7975**: In any event, take this. I don't remember how to use it, anyway!
- **7976**: The deeds you have performed for me today will not go forgotten.
- **7977**: It is no use...I have lost contact with my homeland. It appears I will be living out the rest of my days in this miserable wasteland... Fortunately, I still have my wits about me.
- **7978**: ...And you to keep me company, turban. Oh, promise me you'll never forsake my poor frostbitten head again! You won't? Oh, thank you, dear friend! Thank you!
