- **7506**: Due to the difference in the number of participants, we are still accepting entry applications.
- **7595**: What do you wish to know about? [Basic rules./About the Petra./About Sprint./About Scout./About Gate Breach./About area-specific rules./About returning to battle./About special rules./Nothing at the moment.]
- **7596**: Ballista is an exercise once used by the San d'Orian armies to train the Royal Knights in the art of the siege. The word "ballista" means "to throw a stone," and the game has been a part of Vana'dielian military history for centuries.
- **7597**: The rules are simple. Ballista is played by two teams over a number of hours (Vana'diel time). The team with the most points at the end of the match is the victor.
- **7598**: Players from both teams must search for Petras that a Herald has buried in various locations across the battlefield. The players must then take these stones and throw them into targets known as Rooks.
- **7599**: These Rooks can appear in various locations around the battlefield, and both teams are allowed to throw their Petras into them.
- **7600**: Finally, a player's strength is adjusted depending on his or her level. It is felt that this ultimately allows for a more balanced battle.
- **7601**: Petras can be buried anywhere. Once a player believes he or she has found one, the Quarry (/quarry) command should be used to dig up the area at his or her feet.
- **7602**: Sometimes a player may find items other than Petras, such as potions. These temporary items can only be used during the current match (or Best of Three series).
- **7603**: Players can carry more than one Petra, but they cannot throw the stones away once they have obtained them. However, players will lose their Petras if they: (1) Successfully throw them into a rook. (2) Leave the area. (3) Are knocked out.
- **7604**: But don't forget, a player will be unable to use the Sprint command while in possession of a Petra. And, players can only use the Scout command if they carry one of the stones.
- **7605**: As one can see, careful planning and impeccable timing are the keys to victory.
- **7606**: All participants of Ballista will have the ability to use the Sprint command. This will temporarily increase one's movement speed, creating a better chance to find and obtain Petras.
- **7607**: However, remember that once a player has obtained a Petra, he or she will be unable to use the Sprint command. In its place, though, one may use the Scout command.
- **7608**: The locations of the Rooks are constantly changing. This makes it quite difficult to find the targets by just randomly walking about the area.
- **7609**: Communication with one's team members is, of course, one way to locate Rooks. However, another way is by using the Scout command. This will inform a player of the approximate location of the nearest Rook.
- **7610**: Finally, Scout can only be used when a player is carrying a Petra. Because Sprint cannot be used at this time, players must be weary of approaching enemies.
- **7611**: So, a Petra has been obtained and a Rook located. Now all that's left is tossing the stone in, right? Wrong.
- **7612**: There is one aspect of Ballista that has yet to be mentioned...and this is where the real battle begins.
- **7613**: To throw a Petra into a Rook, a player must first wait until the Rook's gate is open. This takes impeccable timing, as the gate is only open for a short while.
- **7614**: But not just anyone can score points this way. A player must first take down a member of the opposing team and achieve Gate Breach status. Only then will his or her shots count.
- **7615**: This extreme method of combat is what made the ancient game of Ballista famous, and transformed its participants into heroes.
- **7616**: Running about looking for stones is no different from a child's game of hide-and-seek. Knowing when to strike is what separates the men from the boys.
- **7617**: The following match types are area-specific: All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Allowed: Jugner Forest All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Restricted: Pashhow Marshlands Best of Three (three matches) * Normal Items Allowed: Meriphataud Mountains
- **7618**: Best of Three series rules are as follows: Winning a match will earn a nation one "match point." The nation with the most match points at the end of the series will be declared the victor. Winning the third and final match and producing the high scorer will result in two match points awarded. This allows both sides the chance for "come-from-behind" victories.
- **7619**: Between each of the matches, a short interval will be implemented. During this interval, Invisible and Sneak will be cast on all participants. We suggest this time be used to discuss strategies with the other members of your nation's forces.
- **7620**: Players will be forbidden from using any items they bring to the battlefield. Only temporary items that are quarried may be used. A total of fifteen temporary items (though only one of each type) can be carried.
- **7621**: When this rule is in effect, all players will be presented with five complimentary temporary items at the beginning of the match.
- **7622**: For more information on temporary items, refer to the "special rules."
- **7623**: After being KO'd, if a player chooses to be revived at the spot he was defeated, 100% of all HP and 50% of all MP will be restored. In addition, the player will maintain 50% of the TP he had earned.
- **7624**: If a player chooses to return to their force's camp, HP and MP will be fully restored, but all TP will be lost.
- **7625**: Please note that many of the rules previously considered "special" have been fully implemented. Also, several new special rules have been added.
- **7626**: Learn about which special rules? [Temporary items./Ballista Points./Scoring restrictions./Gate Breach radius expansion./Resistance to Sleep./Open entries./Minimum level restrictions./Re-entry restrictions./Participant & Rook numbers./Experience Points./Return.]
- **7627**: Previously, participants in Ballista were required to use an item the moment they dug it up using the /quarry command. However, players can now stock these items as temporary items for use at any time during the match.
- **7628**: Players can hold up to ten temporary items, but only one of each type. If a player finds an item that they already possess, they must use it immediately or throw it away.
- **7629**: If players who possess ten temporary items find an item that they have not already obtained, they will also have the option to exchange it with one of their current items.
- **7630**: Also, players will not, at any time, be allowed to trade temporary items. However, there are items that can be used on other Ballista participants. Please note that players may not be able to use these special items as soon as they are quarried.
- **7631**: Finally, the Heralds will collect temporary items when the match (the third in a Best of Three series) has concluded.
- **7632**: Ballista Points are rewarded to each competitor based on his or her performance in a single Ballista match. The maximum number of points that can be accumulated per match is $0.
- **7633**: While it is taken into consideration, scoring Petras is not the only way to earn Ballista Points. Assisting allies and defeating members of the enemy forces can also earn a high score.
- **7634**: Ballista Points can be traded for special "vouchers," which may be exchanged for free temporary items at the start of new matches.
- **7635**: However, remember that depending on the level restriction of the match, certain vouchers will not be redeemed at the beginning of a match. Speak with a Marshal directly after a match to register your points.
- **7636**: Players will only be allowed to score up to five Petras at a time. Also, a player's Gate Breach status will be automatically disengaged if a Petra is not scored within a certain amount of time. The amount of time is increased for those members of the team currently behind in points.
- **7637**: All allies within a certain radius will achieve Gate Breach status when a member of the enemy forces is defeated.
- **7638**: Players' resistance to sleep will be increased.
- **7639**: During the entry period, from $0:, all adventurers will be allowed to join the forces with the smallest number of participants, regardless of allegiance. Open entries will be accepted until both sides have reached maximum capacity.
- **7640**: In order to ensure balanced matches, the following level limits are enforced: Level 30 matches: 1\`30
- **7641**: Level 40 matches: 31\`40 Level 50 matches: 41\`50 Level 60 matches: 51\`60 Unrestricted matches: 61\`
- **7642**: Please note that any participant who cancels his or her registration will not be allowed to re-apply for the same match.
- **7643**: When the total number of participants in a match is less than 40, the location of the two camps will be adjusted. Also in this case, the number of Rooks will be reduced to two.
- **7644**: Any adventurer whose main level is over 30 will receive EXP for participating in a Ballista match. However, no EXP will be rewarded if the adventurer fails to actively take part in the match.
- **7645**: Read which chapter on B.P. Ranking? [Basic Information./Registering Points./Rewards./Chevron & Title List./None.]
- **7646**: Ballista Point Ranking is based upon all Ballista Points registered from the past ten matches in each of the three participating battle areas.
- **7647**: Anyone who wishes to take part in the ranking needs to register [his/her] points within four hours (Vana'diel time) from the end of the previous match.
- **7648**: After the registration period ends, players can compare their record with those of the previous nine matches.
- **7649**: If, at any time, a player ranks in the top ten (overall) or first for a specific job, [he/she] will have the opportunity to receive a special chevron as well as a new title.
- **7650**: There are four types of chevrons and titles awarded to top-ten players (gold/mythril/silver/bronze), as well as twenty-two different types awarded for outstanding performances by players of each of the twenty-two jobs.
- **7651**: Wearing a chevron during a Ballista match will automatically change a player's current title. If a player wishes to possess this title after a match as well, [he/she] must contact a certain bard in San d'Oria.
- **7652**: Also, while wearing a chevron, players will be able to trade Ballista Points for temporary items not available to all players.
- **7653**: However, the rules of Ballista state that players may only possess a certain chevron for no longer than one half Vana'diel year. When that time comes, they are required to return the chevron before being allowed to participate in any further matches.
- **7654**: Finally, checking someone during a Ballista match will display the total number of chevrons that person has accumulated to date.
- **7655**: View which chevron/title? [1st (overall)./2nd (overall)./3rd (overall)./4th-10th (overall)./1st (warrior)./1st (monk)./1st (white mage)./1st (black mage)./1st (red mage)./1st (thief)./1st (paladin)./1st (dark knight)./1st (beastmaster)./1st (bard)./1st (ranger)./1st (samurai)./1st (ninja)./1st (dragoon)./1st (summoner)./1st (blue mage)./1st (corsair)./1st (puppetmaster)./1st (dancer)./1st (scholar)./1st (geomancer)./1st (rune fencer)./Return.]
