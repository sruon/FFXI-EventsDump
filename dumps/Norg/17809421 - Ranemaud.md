## String References

- **10221**: So, you need $0. I see Master Jaucribaix is starting another project. Let me tell you where to find that item.
- **10222**: You won't just find one lying around anywhere. Forging a katana is somewhat of a ritual. The smith focuses all his spiritual energy into the task. Thus, the $0 used must be from a spiritual place as well.
- **10223**: Beyond the Meriphataud Mountains is an ancient forest known as the Sanctuary of Zi'Tah. There you will find a tree that has been standing for over a thousand years.
- **10224**: Only a branch from this tree is suitable for the flame that burns in Master Jaucribaix's furnace. However, take care when traveling in Zi'Tah, as it is a land of much mystery and danger.
- **10225**: Here, take this $1. You will know what to do with it when you arrive at the tree. Take care not to lose it, as it is a very rare item.
- **10226**: What? You need another $1? And after I told you how important it was! If you want me to give you another one, bring me one $2 and two $3, and I will think about it.
- **10227**: If you want me to give you another $1, bring me one $2 and two $3, and I will think about it.
- **10228**: I do not mean to sound rude, but this is a very important item. Do not go losing it again.
- **10229**: Welcome back from your journey. Please deliver that $0 directly to Master Jaucribaix.
- **10357**: Unlike armor, the strength of a weapon depends solely on the skill of its owner. Just because one's blade is sharp doesn't mean one can wield it to its full potential.
- **10358**: But an adventurer such as yourself would have already known that...
- **10653**: Well, if it isn't my favorite adventurer. How is your training coming along? I can see that you have become quite the samurai.
- **10654**: But small talk is not why you have come to me, is it? It is a shame that your $0 has met such a regrettable fate.
- **10655**: However, you need not worry. The one place where you can obtain $0 is here in Norg.
- **10656**: Like a salmon returns to its birthplace to die, all $0 that are disposed of by their owners make their way back here to Norg. The blade you disposed of is not an exception.
- **10657**: I do not know what reasons you had when disposing of your $0, but the moment that blade left your possession, it became ours once again.
- **10658**: I can return it to you if you wish, but it will cost you. Pay me $7 gil, and I will give back to you what you once let slip through your hands.
- **10659**: The destiny that lies ahead of that $0 is much more important than you could ever imagine. Take care of it this time.
