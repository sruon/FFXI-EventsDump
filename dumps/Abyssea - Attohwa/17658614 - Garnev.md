## String References

- **8139**: What am I doing here, you ask? I could ask you the same. Now get lost, stranger.
- **8140**: Hmmmmmm... Yes, there's no mistaking it. You're <Player>, aren't you?
- **8141**: How do I know your name? That's classified information. What's important is, I'm looking to make a transaction. For $0, to be precise.
- **8142**: "What do you need them for?" That's classified information, too. You're a nosy one, aren't you?
- **8143**: Let's just say that they have a certain...value...to me and the people I work for.
- **8144**: What I'm sayin' is, they're worth more to us than they could ever be to you. And that's all you need to know.
- **8145**: Now let's get back to business.
- **8146**: Our intelligence reports say that $0 can be found inside the pyxides.
- **8147**: You know, those treasure caskets that you'll find being guarded by Abyssean fiends.
- **8148**: Or sometimes you'll even find them just lying around. Ever wondered why that is? Well, I can't tell you...it's classified information.
- **8149**: Track down one of those $0 and bring it back to me, and I'll hook you up with some of our finest wares.
- **8150**: Let's see that. Hmm, yes, $0, there's no mistaking it. Looks like we have a deal.
- **8151**: As you can see, doing business with me is well worth your while. If you come across any more $0, you know where to bring them.
