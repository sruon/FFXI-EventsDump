- **8052**: She appears to be communicating with someone...
- **8053**: Yes? What is it? If I've told you once, I've told you a hundred times. Don't bother me when I'm--
- **8054**: ...Wait. Your face is unfamiliar to me. Don't tell me you've travelled here from outside the camp?
- **8055**: This is a surprise indeed...
- **8056**: Wait a moment. If you are truly from the outside, then perhaps you are familiar with Parradamo Tor.
- **8057**: 'Tis a towering crag located in the middle of the chasm, and an ideal spot from which to survey the surrounding area. In fact, we've a plan to establish a new outpost atop this highly strategic location.
- **8058**: To this end, I dispatched a scouting regiment there not long ago...a scouting regiment that gone far too long now without reporting back to me.
- **8059**: Curse those bunglers! And I had figured them for my most capable men! Though given how thin our ranks are these days, I suppose that's not saying much.
- **8060**: You, however, must be quite the seasoned pro to have survived a trek through the wastes. In fact...
- **8061**: Perhaps you could travel to the tor and help me reestablish contact with my men. I have these linkpearls and emergency rations, should they prove necessary. What do you say?
- **8062**: Accept the assignment? [You can count on me!/Not sure I'm up for it...]
- **8063**: Nonsense! A [man/woman] with your survival skills is as capable as anyone in our ranks! I beg of you, you must do this for us!
- **8064**: Thank you. The entire resistance effort is greatly in your debt.
- **8065**: My suspicion is that they've become separated from each other. <Sigh>... How many times did I tell the fools to stay in each other's sight?
- **8066**: At any rate, we're counting on you!
- **8067**: Thanks to your efforts, we've restored contact with the entire scouting regiment. Much as I suspected, their abilities left something to be desired.
- **8068**: [Nevertheless, we/We] must make do with the personnel at hand. It would go far if they could report back even once a day. Is that so much to ask?
- **8069**: Forgive me. I should not lower myself to grousing. Take this for your troubles. You've done the Resistance a great service today!
- **8070**: Hail again, friend. I'm not quite sure how to say this, but it would seem my hapless scouts have once more gone astray.
- **8071**: Loath as I am to burden you yet again, I would be greatly in your debt if you could track them down and deliver these supplies. If not for me, then for the welfare of all the survivors!
