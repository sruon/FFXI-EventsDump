## String References

- **8254**: You call yourself <Player>?
- **8255**: Well, I've never heard of you.
- **8256**: But don't be discouraged. Just keep working at it, and you'll make a name for yourself eventually.
- **8257**: <Player>, eh? Hmm... That name is vaguely familiar. But I'm afraid few in the chasm have heard of you.
- **8258**: If you keep doing whatever you're doing, I'm sure more of the survivors will come to seek your help. Good luck.
- **8259**: Oh, so you're <Player>... Yes, I heard some of the people here in camp talking about you.
- **8260**: It seems you've built up a reputation. Keep up the good work, and greatness surely lies in your future.
- **8261**: Hello, <Player>! I hear your name mentioned quite often these days. You've done well, my friend. Keep at it.
- **8262**: Hello, <Player>! A good deal of people here in camp know about you!
- **8263**: And they all say you're quite the do-gooder! Thank you for helping us in these dark days. Keep up the good work!
- **8264**: <Player>! To all of us here, your name is synonymous with courage and sacrifice! Not a day goes by without hearing of your saintlike service.
- **8265**: I speak for all of us when I express my sincerest appreciation for your generosity. Come what may, for the rest of our days we shall never forget you, the Angel of Attohwa!
