## String References

- **8212**: ...Hm? A matter demands my utmost concentration. Please leave me.
- **8213**: ...Hm? Come closer. Yes, you just might have what it takes...
- **8214**: Tell me, have you noticed the positively putrid air quality in the chasm of late? Of course you have. Anyone with a nose would notice.
- **8215**: A certain professor--who, to save him from embarrassment, I shall not name--believes it solely caused by a noxious plant that lies to the west. But does this theory hold water? No, it does not.
- **8216**: For there is a far more prominent source right before our very eyes. I speak, of course, of the miasmas.
- **8217**: You are familiar with them, no? Why, only a fool would not be! Noxious billows of black gas that seep up from cracks in the earth.
- **8218**: Why, this foul smog is so thick as to completely obscure one's vision. Is there any reason not to think it is polluting our air as well? Allow me to answer that: there is not.
- **8219**: Fortunately, there is a dedicated scientist in our ranks who has developed a means to rid Attohwa of these putrid clouds once and for all. I speak, of course, of Harith. That would be me, if I've neglected to introduce myself.
- **8220**: "Allow me to hypothesize, Harith", you say. "You have perfected the recipe, and lack only for a key reagent to prepare the solution--a reagent that you will now ask me to procure."
- **8221**: To which I would then reply: not exactly!
- **8222**: I would ask you to procure the reagent, synthesize the solution, and then go test it for me, all in one fell swoop! You will have to forgive me. This sickly body of mine--which the heavens have inflicted upon me as a trade-off for my genius mind--would hardly survive a trek through the chasm.
- **8223**: Aid in Harith's research? [It's for a worthy cause./I have better things to do.]
- **8224**: Is that so? My hypothesis that you were a [man/woman] of sense and courage was clearly mistaken.
- **8225**: Excellent! I knew you wouldn't let me down.
- **8226**: This is my top-secret recipe. Guard it with your life.
- **8227**: Synthesize the solution, test it on a miasma, and report back to me your findings. A simple enough task, no?
- **8230**: Brilliant! Thanks to you, we've made a crucial discovery: that my theory was one hundred percent as flawless as I thought it was!
- **8231**: The density of the pollutant, divided by air volume, adjusted for temperature and humidity level... Yes, like so...
- **8232**: Ah! Forgive me, friend. I was just reviewing my latest theory.
- **8233**: Though my $0 is remarkably effective in dispersing miasmas, a larger problem remains. The subterranean source of these vile fumes must eventually be dealt with.
- **8234**: We have taken but a single step, but it will prove to be a giant one for all of our kind. I am sure of it! Ahahaha!
