## String References

- **8102**: The chocobos y' see here are what few survived the attack on Jeuno.
- **8103**: A cryin' shame, it is, t' think of all the noble birds who lost their lives that day... It's all I can do t' do right by those that remain...
- **8104**: You there. You strike me as one who appreciates our fine feathered friends. Am I right? Either way, hear me out.
- **8105**: We've got ourselves a stray chocobo on our hands, y'see. Jus' a short while ago, another one of those blasted tremors struck, and when I came back here, sure enough one o' our birds'd gone missin'.
- **8106**: I feel for the poor things, I tell ya.
- **8107**: You could scour the world and not find a stouter-hearted bird than the chocobo. But with earthquakes and landslides and god-awful creatures burstin' forth from each and every crack and crevasse, it's enough to send even the bravest animal into a right panic.
- **8108**: It pains me to think of the poor creature out there, alone and defenseless. And yet, I must stay here and look after the rest o' the flock. Blast it all!
- **8109**: Offer your aid? [Certainly!/I think not...]
- **8110**: The poor lil' critter... I can only hope he survives on his own...
- **8111**: I knew it! Struck me from the start as a [man/woman] o' compassion, ya did.
- **8112**: Now listen up. I don't know what you know about chocobos, but if I can tell ya one thing, they ain't easy to catch. And these days, they're even more skittish than ever.
- **8113**: First you'll have to lure him out o' wherever he's hiding. If you spot his tracks, just set down $0 and he should pop his head out b'fore long.
- **8114**: Now here's what separates a wrangler from a stable [boy/girl]. A panicking chocobo can scarce tell th' difference b'tween friend and foe, and'll run from the sight of most anything.
- **8115**: So you'll be wantin' to sneak up from behind, all stealthy-like. Get close enough, and...grab 'im while he's none the wiser!
- **8116**: It's a right hassle to do on yer own, so I'd recommend bringin' along a friend or two.
- **8117**: That should be all ya need to know. Now hurry! The little critter's countin' on you!
- **8118**: Well, will ya look at this? Back safe and sound! Brings a tear to this stableman's eye, I tell ya.
- **8119**: This ain't much in comparison to th' life of a noble bird, but I want ya to have it. From one bird lover to another.
- **8120**: The bird ya brought back is doin' just fine. He's still a bit skittish, o' course, but there's nary a scratch on him. A true friend to these animals, you are.
- **8121**: Oh, it's you again. 'fraid I've got some bad news. Seems another one of my birds has flown the coop...
- **8122**: I'd be greatly obliged if you could bring the critter back like ya did before.
