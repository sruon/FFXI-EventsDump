## String References

- **8351**: I don't recall seeing your face among our passengers...? Me? I was a navigator on the airship that fled Jeuno.
- **8352**: Been doing this job for years, but nothing could have prepared me for that fateful day. Taking off from port with those fiends tearing at our vessel, and our decks and holds overflowing with refugees...
- **8353**: Even more shocking than those beasts were the panic-stricken faces of those townspeople we had to leave behind.
- **8354**: Then, just when we thought we were home free, we saw a rain cloud billowing in the distance. Turns out it was no cloud, but rather a swarm of the nastiest gnats of a size I'd never seen.
- **8355**: Before we knew what hit us, we were plummeting to the bottom of this chasm.
- **8356**: It's a wonder any of us survived, but we did. Picked ourselves out of the wreckage, and made our way up here.
- **8357**: To this day, I ask myself. If I'd plotted a different course, could we have avoided this fate? That said, I don't reckon that anywhere's safe in this world anymore.
- **8358**: The location of the airship wreck? I can't say for sure. Poor vessel shattered into a thousand pieces when it struck the cliff face...
- **8359**: What do you need to know that for, anyway?
- **8360**: Some Taru lady's stewpot!? Pardon me for being blunt, but haven't you got more serious matters to worry about?
- **8361**: ...My apologies. I shouldn't rush to judgment.
- **8362**: We all have to do what we must in these dark times. Anyway, if it hasn't fallen to the depths, the cargo should be scattered around here somewhere. Why don't you search around?
