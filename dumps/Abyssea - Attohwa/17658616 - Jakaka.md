## String References

- **8191**: It was a terrible day, when the skies turned red... I should never have gotten out of...er, woken up? Er, I seem to have misspoken. Anyhow...
- **8192**: My mastery of disguises has proven quite the blessing. For you see, I've been able to keep the fiends gue--er, from finding me. No, that's not what I meant...
- **8193**: At any rate, I suggest you steer clear of Parradamo Tor. Fearsome fiends lurk there, and much, much...er, some other not-so-good things. <Grumble>... Why can't I think straight these days?
- **8194**: You search for $6, you say? Why yes, I saw one just the other...night.
- **8195**: Head due south from here to a spot of buried bones and grass patches. Your prey lives there. But be careful, for he...bites?
- **8196**: But the little critter will not be easily found. No, he will only show himself if he hears a...noise. Er, like a clap of the hands.
- **8197**: I swear...I just can't seem to express myself properly these days. This accursed red sky is the cause of it all, I'll bet...
