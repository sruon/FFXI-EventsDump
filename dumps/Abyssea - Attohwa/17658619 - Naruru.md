## String References

- **8235**: Oh, miracle of miracles!
- **8236**: The sky may be blood-red, and nasty-wasty fiends may threaten to devour us at any momentaru, but I must give thanks that I am still alive!
- **8237**: I was in Jeuno with my darling son, whiling away the hours for my sweet husband-wusband to return from a business trip. Next thing I knew, I was on an airship plummet-wummeting into the chasm, flames and fiends everywhere!
- **8238**: But my dearest Panta-Putta was nowhere to be seen. No one else said they saw him on the ship...that's it! I must have left him in Jeuno, where it's safe. Yes, that must be it. The others say that Jeuno fell, but that just can't be! Its high walls, and the Archduke, and that scary-wary Wolfgang to defend it.
- **8239**: The others don't know what they're talking about. That was a scary-wary crash, I'm sure they're just in shock. My little boy is safe in Jeuno and waiting for his mommy to come home, I'm sure of it. I'm sorry, I just can't think straight these days. Yes, I must be grateful-wateful just to have my life.
- **8240**: Oh, drat! This won't do at all!
- **8241**: Here I had the wonderful idea of treating my fellow survivors to a piping-wiping hot bowl of Tarutaru stew, and yet...why, I am the only Taru in sight! Wherever will I find the choice cuts of--
- **8242**: Oh, heavens-weavens, what am I saying!? Tarutaru stew is made by Tarutaru, not of them! Forgive me, it must be this red sky that is putting these awful-wawful thoughts in my mind...
- **8243**: What I meant to say was that I seem to have misplaced my favoritaru stewpot! Without it, the flavor just doesn't turn out as savory, I tell you.
- **8244**: I could have sworn that I had it with me on the airship. Come to think of it, I can't shakey-wake the feeling that I've misplaced something else as well...
- **8245**: That's it! I'd recognize my favorite stewpot anywhere!
- **8246**: But what's this? Why, there's a hole in the bottom! Why, if I used this, all the succulent chunks of Taruta--no, no, bad Naruru! I mean, the chunks of some meat that is decided-widedly not Tarutaru will escape!
- **8247**: <Sniff>... And it was a special order from the Windurst Culinarians' Guild. Wherever will I find a new one?
- **8248**: My stewpot! Why, it looks just like the day I boughtaru it! However did you manage that?
- **8249**: Finally, I can treat the others to a scrumptious-wumptious Naruru stew. I mean, Naruru's stew! I can't make a stew and be in it at the same time...silly Naruru. Now where did you put those ingredientarus...?
- **8250**: ...
- **8251**: I can't stop thinking about my sweetaru husband and son.
- **8252**: Teigero hadn't gotten back before I left...but why did I get on the airship in the first place? For the life of me, I just can't remember.
- **8253**: If only they were here now, I would put them into--no! I mean, treat them to a bowl of piping hot stew! Oh, Naruru, whatever has gotten into you!?
- **8374**: What's this? A letter?
- **8375**: Why, whoever-wever could it be from?
- **8376**: T...Teigero-Bangero!!!
- **8377**: My husband still lives!? Oh, please let this be true, and not some mad dream induced by these ghastly red skies. Do you swear with all your heartaru?
- **8378**: <Player> nods emphatically.
- **8379**: Oh, joyous-woyous day! I thought I had lost my beloved forever!
- **8380**: Should you see him again, would you be so kind as to pass along this linkpearl?
- **8381**: I know that I ask much, but just the thought that I could hear that sweet, squeaky-weaky voice of his again... <Sigh>...Teigero-Bangero...
- **8382**: Oh, but I must let this happiness be my strength. For the other survivors, and for my sweet child who awaits us in Jeuno...
- **8383**: Oh, [Mister/Madam] <Player>, you're back? Why, whatever is that you have with you?
- **8384**: Ow...owww! I feel so light-headed all of a sudden. Whatever has come over me?
- **8385**: Wait! Oh, please waitaru!
- **8386**: Panta-Putta! No!!!
- **8387**: <Sniff>... Panta-Putta... My Panta-Putta...
- **8388**: That $3 was his favorite-wavorite hat.
- **8389**: Oh, <Player>, I remember now. It was all my fault! We were making our way through a veritable sea of people as we fled to the rescue airships in Port Jeuno. One moment, I was holding his hand, but the next...
- **8390**: Before I knew it, my airship was liftaruing off, bound for Windurst. My eyes scoured the ground below for sight of my dear son, only to see him scrambling aboard another vessel-wessel bound for San d'Oria...
- **8391**: My heart jumped. At least he will be safe, I thought! The next second, a wave of fiends rushed onto the deck, tearing the vessel apart and hurling the would-be refugees to their doom.
- **8392**: If only... If only I had held his hand more tightly... If only I had not let go... Panta-Putta!
- **8393**: ...
- **8394**: Forgive me, <Player>.
- **8395**: I must be strong, not for my own sake but for those who still depend on me. Panta-Putta will live on always, in his mother's heart.
- **8396**: The hat, you can keep. Panta-Putta always said he wanted to be an adventurer when he grew up. Perhaps he can be a trusty-wusty companion to you in your travels.
- **8397**: Even if he had lived, this day would have come. To see him off--not with tears, but with pride in my heart--is my duty as a mother.
- **8398**: Is that not so, <Player>? Now be strong, and be safe!
